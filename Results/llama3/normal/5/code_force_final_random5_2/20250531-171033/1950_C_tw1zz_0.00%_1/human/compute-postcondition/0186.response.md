Postcondition: ***h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, and m is a string of two digits representing minutes. If h is '15', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '03'. If h is '16', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '04'. If h is '17', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '05'. If h is '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively. If h is not '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then time and h1 remain unchanged.***
