Output State: **h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'PM', h1 is '09', t is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm.**

The code snippet assigns the string '09' to the variable h1 and the string 'PM' to the variable time. The value of h remains an empty string, and the value of m1 remains a string of two digits representing minutes. The value of t remains a positive integer greater than 0, and stdin still contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm.
