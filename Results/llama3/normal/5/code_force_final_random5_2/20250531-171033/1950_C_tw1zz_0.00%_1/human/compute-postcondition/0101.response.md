The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '01' to the variable h1. The second line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable time. 

The initial state of the variables is as follows: h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is a string, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, h1 is an empty string, m is a string of two digits representing minutes.

After the code executes, the state of the variables is as follows: h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'AM', stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, h1 is '01', m is a string of two digits representing minutes.

Output State: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'AM', stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, h1 is '01', m is a string of two digits representing minutes.**
