Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. It takes the time in 24-hour format as input, splits it into hours and minutes, and then determines the equivalent time in 12-hour format based on the hour value. The program correctly handles the conversion for all possible hour values from 00 to 23 and prints the converted time in the required format.

However, there is a logical error in the program. When the hour is '00', the program sets the time to 'PM', which is incorrect. '00' in 24-hour format corresponds to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format, not 12:00 PM.

Correctness: **False**
