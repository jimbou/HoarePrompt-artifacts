The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '06' to the variable `h1`, and the second line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable `time`. 

Since `h1` was initially an empty string, it now becomes '06'. The value of `time` is now 'AM'. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'AM', h1 is '06', m is a string of two digits representing minutes, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1**
