The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain t lines of strings in the format hh:mm and t is a positive integer greater than 1.
State: **`h` is a string, `m1` is a string of two digits representing minutes, `time` is a string, stdin contains t lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes.**
