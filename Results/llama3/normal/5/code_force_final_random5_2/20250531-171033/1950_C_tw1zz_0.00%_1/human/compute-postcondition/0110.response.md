Output State: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'AM', t is a positive integer greater than 1, h1 is '10', m is a string of two digits representing minutes, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `h1` and `time`. The first line assigns the string '10' to `h1`, and the second line assigns the string 'AM' to `time`. These assignments do not affect any other variables. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
