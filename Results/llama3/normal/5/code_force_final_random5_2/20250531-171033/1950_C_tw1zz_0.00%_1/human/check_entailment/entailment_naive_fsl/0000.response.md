Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is '00:00', the program outputs '12 : 00  PM', which is incorrect. According to the problem description, '00:00' in 24-hour format should be equivalent to '12:00 AM' in 12-hour format, not '12:00 PM'.
