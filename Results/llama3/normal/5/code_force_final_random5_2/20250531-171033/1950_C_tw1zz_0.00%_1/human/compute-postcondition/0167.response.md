Output State: **h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, time is 'PM', h1 is '03', t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm**

The code assigns the value '03' to `h1` and 'PM' to `time`. The values of `h`, `m1`, `t`, `m`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
