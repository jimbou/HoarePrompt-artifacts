To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `input()` reads a line from `stdin`, we need to ensure that `stdin` contains a valid input.

State: **`stdin` contains a valid input: the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1440), and the following t lines each contain a string s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
