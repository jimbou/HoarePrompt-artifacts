Output State: **h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, time is 'AM', h1 is '12', t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm**

The code assigns the string '12' to the variable h1 and the string 'AM' to the variable time. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
