Postcondition: ***h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 0. If h is '05', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '05'. If h is '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 is an empty string. If h is between '13' and '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. Otherwise, h, m1, time remain unchanged.***
