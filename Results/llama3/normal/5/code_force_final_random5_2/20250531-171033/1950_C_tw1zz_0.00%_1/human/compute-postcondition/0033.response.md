Output State: **h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'AM', h1 is '11', t is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm**

The code assigns the value '11' to the variable h1 and the value 'AM' to the variable time. The values of h, m1, and t remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The stdin also remains unchanged, containing t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm.
