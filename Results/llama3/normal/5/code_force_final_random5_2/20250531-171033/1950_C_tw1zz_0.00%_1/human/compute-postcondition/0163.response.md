The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '11' to the variable `h1`. The second line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable `time`. 

These two lines do not affect the values of `h`, `m1`, `stdin`, `t`, or `m`. The values of these variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, time is 'AM', h1 is '11', stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes.**
