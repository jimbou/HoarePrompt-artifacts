The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '05' to the variable h1. The second line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable time. 

After executing the code, the values of h1 and time are updated. The value of h1 is now '05', and the value of time is now 'AM'. The values of h, m1, m, t, and stdin remain unchanged.

Output State: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'AM', h1 is '05', m is a string of two digits representing minutes, t is a positive integer greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm.**
