The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of lines in stdin the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain t-2 lines of strings in the format hh:mm and t is a positive integer greater than 1.
State: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is a string, stdin contains t-2 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1**
