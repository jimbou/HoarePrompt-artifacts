Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly identify the "PEAK" condition. According to the problem description, a peak satisfies the condition a<b>c. However, the program checks for the condition max(a, b, c) == b, which is not equivalent to a<b>c. For example, if the input is (1, 3, 2), the program will incorrectly print "NONE" instead of "PEAK".
