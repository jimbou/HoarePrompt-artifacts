The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are then assigned these three integers, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing three digits, the first line is read and split into three integers. These integers are assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.

The values of `t`, `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits.**
