Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits. Either `a` is not less than `b`, or `b` is not less than `c`. `a`, `b`, `c` are not all equal. The current value of `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'PEAK' is being printed**
