The function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains three digits. It then classifies each set of three digits into one of four categories: 'STAIR' if the digits are in strictly increasing order, 'PEAK' if the middle digit is the largest, 'NONE' if the digits are all equal, and 'NONE' otherwise. The classification of each set of digits is printed to the console. The function consumes all input from standard input and leaves the input stream empty.
