Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing three digits. If `a`, `b`, `c` are all equal, 'NONE' is printed. If `a`, `b`, `c` are not all equal, then if `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
