Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to the three digits read from the first line of the input. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not updated by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits, as one line has been read and processed.
