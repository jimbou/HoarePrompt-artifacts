Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, then 'NONE' is printed. If the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
