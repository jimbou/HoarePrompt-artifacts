Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits. Either `a` is not less than `b`, or `b` is not less than `c`. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, 'NONE' is printed. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, 'PEAK' is printed if the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, otherwise 'NONE' is printed.***
