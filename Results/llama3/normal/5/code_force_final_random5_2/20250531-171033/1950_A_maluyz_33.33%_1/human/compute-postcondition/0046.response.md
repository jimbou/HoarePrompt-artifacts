Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 1000, `i` is `t`, stdin is empty.**

The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables involved in the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` has reached its final value, which is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The stdin is empty, as all input lines have been processed by the loop.
