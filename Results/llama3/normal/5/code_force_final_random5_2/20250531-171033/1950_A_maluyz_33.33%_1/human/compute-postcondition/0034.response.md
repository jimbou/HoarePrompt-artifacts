Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing three digits.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to the three integers read from the first line of the input, which contains three digits. The remaining `t-4` lines in the input are still present in the stdin. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
