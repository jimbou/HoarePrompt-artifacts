Postcondition: **a is a list of integers of length n, b is a list of integers of length m, k is an integer, n and m are non-negative integers such that m < n, 1 <= k <= m, and 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, good_subarrays is 0, b_freq is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in list b, window_freq is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of list a, the current value of matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both window_freq and b_freq, and it is greater than or equal to k, and i is 0.**
