Postcondition: ***a is a list of integers of length n, b is a list of integers of length m, k is an integer, n and m are non-negative integers such that m < n, 1 <= k <= m, and 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j. If the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both the first m elements of list a and list b is greater than or equal to k, then good_subarrays is 1. Otherwise, good_subarrays remains 0.***
