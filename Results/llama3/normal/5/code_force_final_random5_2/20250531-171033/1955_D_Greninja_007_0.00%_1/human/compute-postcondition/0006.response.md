Output State: **a is a list of integers of length n, b is a list of integers of length m, k is an integer, n and m are non-negative integers such that m < n, 1 <= k <= m, and 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j. If the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both the first m elements of list a and list b is greater than or equal to k, then good_subarrays is 1. Otherwise, good_subarrays remains 0. The current value of a[i] is an integer that exists in b_freq. matches is decreased by the minimum frequency of a[i] in both the current window of a and b.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists a and b, and the integer k remain unchanged. The value of matches is decreased by the minimum frequency of the current element a[i] in both the current window of a and b. The condition for good_subarrays remains the same, depending on the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both the first m elements of list a and list b being greater than or equal to k.
