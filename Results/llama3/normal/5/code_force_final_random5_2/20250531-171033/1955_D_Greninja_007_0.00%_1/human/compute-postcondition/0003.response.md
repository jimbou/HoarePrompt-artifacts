Output State: **a is a list of integers of length n, b is a list of integers of length m, k is an integer, n and m are non-negative integers such that m < n, 1 <= k <= m, and 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, good_subarrays is 1, b_freq is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in list b, window_freq is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of list a, the current value of matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both window_freq and b_freq, and it is greater than or equal to k, and i is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as well as the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, `b_freq`, `window_freq`, and `i`. The only change is that the variable `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The value of `matches` is still greater than or equal to `k`.
