Output State: **a is a list of integers of length n, b is a list of integers of length m, k is an integer, n and m are non-negative integers such that m <= n, 1 <= k <= m, and 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, good_subarrays is 0, b_freq is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in list b, window_freq is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of list a, and matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both window_freq and b_freq.**

In this output state, the initial conditions for a, b, k, n, and m remain unchanged. The code introduces three new variables: good_subarrays, b_freq, and window_freq. The variable good_subarrays is initialized to 0, b_freq is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in list b, and window_freq is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of list a. The variable matches is calculated as the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both window_freq and b_freq.
