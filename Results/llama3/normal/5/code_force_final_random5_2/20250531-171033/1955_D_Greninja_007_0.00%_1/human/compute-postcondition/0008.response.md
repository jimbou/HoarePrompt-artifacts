Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length n, `b` is a list of integers of length m, `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that m < n, 1 <= k <= m, and 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j. If the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both the first m elements of list a and list b is greater than or equal to k, then good_subarrays is 1. Otherwise, good_subarrays remains 0. If the current value of a[i] is an integer that exists in b_freq, matches is decreased by the minimum frequency of a[i] in both the current window of a and b. Otherwise, no change is made to matches. The frequency of a[i] in the window_freq is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `a` and `b`, the integer `k`, and the non-negative integers `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `good_subarrays` is still dependent on the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both the first `m` elements of list `a` and list `b`. The value of `matches` is decreased by the minimum frequency of `a[i]` in both the current window of `a` and `b` if `a[i]` exists in `b_freq`. The frequency of `a[i]` in the `window_freq` is decreased by 1.
