This function takes two inputs: a list of two integers representing the number of lines (N) and columns (M) in a field, and a list of strings where the first N elements describe the field and the remaining elements describe actions. It returns two values: the number of lines (N) plus the list of strings describing the field, and the number of columns (M) plus the list of strings describing the actions.
