#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings, where the first element of a represents the number of lines (N) and the second element represents the number of columns (M) in the field, and the elements of b represent the field and the actions, with the first N elements of b describing the field and the remaining elements describing the actions.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns the number of lines (N) in the field plus the list of strings describing the field, and the number of columns (M) in the field plus the list of strings describing the actions.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two inputs: a list of two integers representing the number of lines (N) and columns (M) in a field, and a list of strings where the first N elements describe the field and the remaining elements describe actions. It returns two values: the number of lines (N) plus the list of strings describing the field, and the number of columns (M) plus the list of strings describing the actions.
