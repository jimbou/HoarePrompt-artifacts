Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to simulate a game of Quidditch, where two teams, Red and Blue, compete to score points by moving the Quaffle (a ball) into the opponent's goal. The program takes input from the user, including the size of the field, the initial positions of the players, goals, and Quaffle, and a series of moves made by the players.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and Quaffle positions based on the user's input.
2.  The `mouvements` dictionary is correctly defined to map movement directions (L, R, U, D) to their corresponding coordinate changes.
3.  The `middle` variable is correctly calculated as the center of the field.
4.  The `quidditch` list is correctly initialized to store the Quaffle's position and the player carrying it (if any).
5.  The `pointsb` and `pointsr` variables are correctly initialized to keep track of the score for each team.
6.  The program correctly processes each move made by the players, updating their positions and the Quaffle's position accordingly.
7.  When a player catches the Quaffle, the program correctly updates the `quidditch` list to reflect the new carrier.
8.  When a player throws the Quaffle, the program correctly updates the Quaffle's position and checks if it has been thrown into a goal. If so, it updates the score and prints the corresponding message.
9.  The program correctly handles the case where a player is eliminated by the Bludger, removing them from the game and updating the Quaffle's position if necessary.
10. Finally, the program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

However, there are a few minor issues with the program:

*   The `func_1` function is not necessary and can be replaced with a simple tuple addition.
*   The `z` variable in the elimination handling code is not necessary and can be removed.
*   The program does not handle the case where a player tries to move outside the field. Although the problem statement guarantees that this will not happen, it's still a good practice to add bounds checking to prevent potential errors.

Despite these minor issues, the program is generally correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
