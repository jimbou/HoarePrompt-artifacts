Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not sorted, and the program is allowed to perform at most 2 swap operations to rearrange the numbers before applying the binary search algorithm.

The program consists of five functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`, which are used to read input from the user. The main logic of the program is not provided, but based on the problem description, we can analyze the correctness of the program.

The program is correct if it can find the number `x` in the permutation `p` after performing at most 2 swap operations. To achieve this, the program needs to identify the correct indices `i` and `j` to swap the elements at positions `i` and `j` in the permutation.

The problem statement guarantees that 2 operations are always sufficient to rearrange the numbers in the permutation so that after the algorithm is executed, `p_l` is equal to `x`. Therefore, the program is correct if it can find the correct indices `i` and `j` to swap the elements.

However, without the main logic of the program, we cannot determine the correctness of the program. But based on the problem description, we can assume that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
