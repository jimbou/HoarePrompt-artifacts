Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the program does not provide any implementation to achieve this goal. It only defines some functions for input/output operations, but it does not contain any logic to solve the problem.

A correct program should implement the binary search algorithm and the swapping operation to rearrange the numbers in the permutation. It should also handle the cases where the number of operations is 0, 1, or 2, and output the correct results accordingly.

For example, if the input is:

5
1 2 3 4 5

The program should output:

0

Because the permutation is already sorted and no swapping operation is needed.

But if the input is:

5
3 1 6 5 2 4

The program should output:

1
3 4

Because one swapping operation is needed to rearrange the numbers in the permutation.

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly, therefore it is incorrect.
