Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c`. If all elements of `a` and `c` are the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then 0 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` which is `ans` is being printed.***
