The code prints the maximum absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and either the maximum or minimum element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order.
Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of the sorted list a and the sorted list c in reverse order, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of c, and the maximum absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and either the maximum or minimum element of the sorted list c in reverse order is being printed**
