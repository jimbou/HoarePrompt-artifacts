Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, and `k` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2. The value of `ans` is increased by the maximum of the absolute differences between the first elements of `a` and `c` and the last elements of `a` and `c`. The values of `i` and `j` are determined based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2`, which are the absolute differences between the first and last elements of `a` and `c`, respectively.
