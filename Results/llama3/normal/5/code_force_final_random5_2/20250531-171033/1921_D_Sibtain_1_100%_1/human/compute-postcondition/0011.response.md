Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with exactly one element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, and the maximum absolute difference between the single element in list a and the maximum or minimum element in list c is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables n, m, a, c, and _ remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2. The maximum absolute difference between the single element in list a and the maximum or minimum element in list c is still being printed. However, the continue statement causes the program to skip to the next iteration of the loop, effectively bypassing any code that follows the continue statement in the current iteration.
