Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of two arrays, a_i and b_i, in a certain order. The program correctly implements the logic to achieve this.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of elements in the arrays a_i and b_i, followed by the elements themselves.
2.  It handles the edge case where all elements in both arrays are the same, in which case the maximum difference is 0.
3.  The program sorts the arrays a_i and b_i in ascending and descending order, respectively. This is a crucial step in finding the maximum difference, as it allows the program to compare the smallest elements of a_i with the largest elements of b_i, and vice versa.
4.  The program then iterates through the sorted arrays, comparing the elements of a_i with the corresponding elements of b_i. It keeps track of the maximum difference found so far and updates it accordingly.
5.  Finally, the program prints the maximum difference found for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
