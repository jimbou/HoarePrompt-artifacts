The only variable in the loop head is variable `k` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is 0 and the list `a` must have at least 1 element.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
