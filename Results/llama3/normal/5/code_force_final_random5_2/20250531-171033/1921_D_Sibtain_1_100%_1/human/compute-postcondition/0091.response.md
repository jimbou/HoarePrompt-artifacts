Postcondition: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers from the third input that is not empty, c is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, _ is 2, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is 0, if t2 is greater than t1, then i is 0 and j is 2, otherwise i is 1 and j is 1.**
