The code prints the value of `ans` which is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations. Where `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, and `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order.

Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is 1, and the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations which is `ans` is being printed**
