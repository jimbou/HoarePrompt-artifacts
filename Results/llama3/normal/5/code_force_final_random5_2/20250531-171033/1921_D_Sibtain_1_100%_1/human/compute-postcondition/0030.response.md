Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of the new `t1` and `t2`, `i` is either 0, 1 or 2, `j` is either 2, 3 or 4**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2, 3, or 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
