The only variables in the loop head are variables  k and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If a is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is a sorted list of integers from the third input does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is not empty and k is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that is not empty, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
