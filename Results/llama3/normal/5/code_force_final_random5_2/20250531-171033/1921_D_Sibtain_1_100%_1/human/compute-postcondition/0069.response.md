Output State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of the sorted list `a` and the ith element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is either 0 or the length of `a`, `j` is either 1 or the length of `a` plus 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variables `n`, `m`, `_`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
- The lists `a` and `c` also remain unchanged.
- The variable `k` is now equal to the length of the list `a`.
- The variables `t1` and `t2` are the absolute differences between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c` in reverse order, and the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c` in reverse order, respectively.
- The variable `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `i` is either 0 or the length of `a`, and the variable `j` is either 1 or the length of `a` plus 1, depending on the values of `t1` and `t2` in each iteration.
