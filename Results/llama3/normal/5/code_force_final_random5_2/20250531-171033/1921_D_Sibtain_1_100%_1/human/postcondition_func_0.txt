This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates and prints the maximum absolute difference between the elements of a_i and b_i for each test case, considering all possible pairings of elements from the two lists. If the lists contain only one element or all elements are the same, it prints the absolute difference between the single element and the closest element in the other list. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the standard input empty.
