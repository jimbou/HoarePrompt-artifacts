Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, i is 0, j is 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c.**

The code calculates the absolute differences between the first elements of lists `a` and `c` and assigns it to `t1`, and the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `c` and assigns it to `t2`. The values of `t1` and `t2` depend on the specific elements in lists `a` and `c`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
