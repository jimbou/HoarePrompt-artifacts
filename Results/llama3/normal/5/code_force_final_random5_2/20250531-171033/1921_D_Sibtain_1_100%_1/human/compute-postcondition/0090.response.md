Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that is not empty, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. The absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state still hold true.
