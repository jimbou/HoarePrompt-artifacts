Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one, without changing any variable values.
