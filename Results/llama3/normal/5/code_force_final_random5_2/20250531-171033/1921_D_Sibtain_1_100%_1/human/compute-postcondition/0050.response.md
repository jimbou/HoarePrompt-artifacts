Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is 0, i is 0, j is 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `t1` and `t2`. The first line assigns the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` to `t1`. The second line assigns the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c` to `t2`. The values of `i` and `j` are used to index into the lists `a` and `c`, but their values are not modified by the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
