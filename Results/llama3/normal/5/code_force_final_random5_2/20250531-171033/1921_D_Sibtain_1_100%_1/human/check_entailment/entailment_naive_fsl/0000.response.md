Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by Vasya. It first checks for the edge case where all elements in both arrays are the same, in which case the difference is 0. Then it sorts both arrays and iterates through them, comparing the absolute differences between corresponding elements and choosing the maximum difference at each step. The program correctly handles the case where the length of the arrays is 1, and it also correctly calculates the maximum total difference D.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
