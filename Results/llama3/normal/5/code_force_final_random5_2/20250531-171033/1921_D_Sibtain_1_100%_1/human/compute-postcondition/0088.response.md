Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers from the third input that is not empty, c is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, _ is 2, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is 0, i is 0, j is 2. The current value of t2 is greater than the current value of t1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, m, a, c, _, k, t1, t2, ans, and i remain unchanged. The value of j is incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The relationship between t1 and t2 remains the same, with t2 being greater than t1.
