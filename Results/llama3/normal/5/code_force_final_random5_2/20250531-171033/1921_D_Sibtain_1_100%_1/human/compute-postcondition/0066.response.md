Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of the sorted list `a` and the ith element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1`, `t2` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `j` is either 1 or 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, stdin, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The value of `j` remains either 1 or 2. The conditions on `i` and `j` based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2` are updated accordingly.
