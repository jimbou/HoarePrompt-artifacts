Output State: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations of the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is equal to the length of `a`.
- The values of `t1` and `t2` are the absolute differences between the first and last elements of `a` and `c` respectively.
- The value of `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations of the loop.
- The value of `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
- The value of `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1.
