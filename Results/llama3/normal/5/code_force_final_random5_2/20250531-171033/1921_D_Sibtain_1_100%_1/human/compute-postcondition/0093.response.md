The only variable in the loop head is variable  k and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and list `a`. If `k` is less than the length of list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0 and list `a` is not empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `a` must have at least 2 elements and `k` is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 1**
