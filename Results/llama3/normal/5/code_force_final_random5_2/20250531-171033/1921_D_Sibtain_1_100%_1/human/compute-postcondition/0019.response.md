Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2. The lists `a` and `c` are still sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively. The relationship between `t1` and `t2` is still maintained, with `t2` being less than or equal to `t1`.
