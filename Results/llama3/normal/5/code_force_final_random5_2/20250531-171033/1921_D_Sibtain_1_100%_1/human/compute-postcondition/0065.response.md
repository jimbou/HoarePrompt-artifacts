Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, k is 2, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of the sorted list a and the ith element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)th element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is the maximum of t1, t2 plus the maximum of t1 and t2, i is either 0 or 1, j is either 2 or 3. If t2 > t1, then i is either 0 or 1, and j is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, i is either 1 or 2, and j is either 2 or 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, m, a, c, _, stdin, k, t1, t2, ans, and i remain the same as in the initial state. The value of j is incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The conditions on i and j are updated accordingly. If t2 is greater than t1, then i is either 0 or 1, and j is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, i is either 1 or 2, and j is either 2 or 3.
