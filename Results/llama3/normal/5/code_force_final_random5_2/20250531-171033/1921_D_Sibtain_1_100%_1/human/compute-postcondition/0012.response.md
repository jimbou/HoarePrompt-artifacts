Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2. If the length of list a is 1, the maximum absolute difference between the single element in list a and the maximum or minimum element in list c is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
