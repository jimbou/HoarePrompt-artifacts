Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers from the third input that is not empty, c is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, _ is 2, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is 0, i is 0, j is 1**

The code updates the values of `t1` and `t2` based on the elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c`. The first line assigns the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` to `t1`. The second line assigns the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c` to `t2`. The values of `i` and `j` are used to index into the lists `a` and `c`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
