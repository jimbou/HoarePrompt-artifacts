The code prints the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, where `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
Output: ** `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c`, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` which is `ans` is being printed**
