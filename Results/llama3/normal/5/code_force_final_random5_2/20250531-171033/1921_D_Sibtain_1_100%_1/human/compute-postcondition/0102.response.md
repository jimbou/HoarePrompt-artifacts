Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 2 times the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise `i` is 2, and `j` is 3 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise `j` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is now 1 + 1 = 2, and `j` is still 3. Otherwise, `i` is now 2 + 1 = 3, but since `i` was 2 when `t2` is not greater than `t1`, `i` is now 2, and `j` is still 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
