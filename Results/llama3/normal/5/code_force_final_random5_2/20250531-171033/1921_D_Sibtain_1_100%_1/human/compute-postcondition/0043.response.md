Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of the sorted list a and the sorted list c in reverse order, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of c.**

The code sorts the list `a` in ascending order and the list `c` in descending order. This affects the values of `t1` and `t2`, which are now the absolute differences between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, and the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, respectively. The value of `ans` is also updated to be the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in reverse order. All other variables remain unchanged.
