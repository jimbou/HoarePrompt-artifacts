The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the length of the list `a`. If `k` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `a` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of the new `t1` and `t2`, `i` is either 0, 1 or 2, `j` is either 1, 2 or 3**
