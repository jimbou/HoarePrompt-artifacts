Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. The absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the lists `a` and `c` and the relationship between `t1` and `t2` are still valid.
