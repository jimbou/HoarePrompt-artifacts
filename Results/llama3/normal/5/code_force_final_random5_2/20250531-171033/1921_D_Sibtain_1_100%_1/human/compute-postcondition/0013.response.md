Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2. If the length of list `a` is 1, the maximum absolute difference between the single element in list `a` and the maximum or minimum element in list `c` is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` are newly introduced and assigned the values 0, 1, and 0, respectively. The condition regarding the length of list `a` and the printing of the maximum absolute difference still holds, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2.
