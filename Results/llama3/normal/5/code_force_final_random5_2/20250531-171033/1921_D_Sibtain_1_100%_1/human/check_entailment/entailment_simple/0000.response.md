Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

The program first checks if all elements in both arrays are the same, in which case the maximum difference is 0. It then sorts both arrays, with array c in reverse order.

The program then uses two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning and end of the arrays respectively. For each element in array a, it calculates the absolute difference with the corresponding element in array c, and adds the maximum of these differences to the total difference.

This approach ensures that the maximum difference is obtained by pairing the smallest elements in array a with the largest elements in array c, and the largest elements in array a with the smallest elements in array c.

Correctness: **True**
