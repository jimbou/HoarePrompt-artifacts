Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 2 elements, c is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, _ is 2, k is 1, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is the maximum of t1 and t2, i is 0 and j is 2 if t2 is greater than t1, otherwise i is 1 and j is 1.**

The code snippet updates the values of `t1` and `t2` based on the elements of lists `a` and `c` at specific indices determined by `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` are determined by the comparison between `t2` and `t1`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. The value of `ans` remains the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
