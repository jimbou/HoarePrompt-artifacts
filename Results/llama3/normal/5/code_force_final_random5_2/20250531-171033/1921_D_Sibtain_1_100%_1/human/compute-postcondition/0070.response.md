Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `i`, and `j`. The loop iterates over the length of the sorted list `a`, and in each iteration, it calculates the absolute differences `t1` and `t2` between the corresponding elements of `a` and `c`, and updates `ans` with the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. After the loop finishes, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` and `t2` are the absolute differences between the last and first elements of `a` and `c`, respectively, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and `j` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
