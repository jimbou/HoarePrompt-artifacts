Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 3 times the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is 0 and `j` is 4 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 3 if `t2` is equal to `t1`, otherwise `i` is 2 and `j` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be 3 times the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
