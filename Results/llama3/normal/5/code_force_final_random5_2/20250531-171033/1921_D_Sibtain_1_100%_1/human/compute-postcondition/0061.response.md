Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, k is 1, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of the sorted list a and the ith element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)th element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is the maximum of t1 and t2, i is either 0 or 1, j is either 1 or 2. If t2 > t1, then i is either 0 or 1, and j is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, i is either 1 or 2, and j is either 1 or 2.**
