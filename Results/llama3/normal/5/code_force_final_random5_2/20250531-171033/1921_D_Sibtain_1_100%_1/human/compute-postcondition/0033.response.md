Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of the new `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0, 1 or 2, and `j` is either 2, 3 or 4, otherwise `i` is either 1 or 2 or 3, and `j` is either 1, 2 or 3, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`**
