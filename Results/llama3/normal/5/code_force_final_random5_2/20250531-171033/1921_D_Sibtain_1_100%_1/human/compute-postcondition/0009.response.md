The code prints the maximum absolute difference between the only element in the list `a` and either the maximum or minimum element in the list `c`. Since `a` is a sorted list in ascending order with exactly one element, `a[0]` is the only element in the list. The list `c` is sorted in descending order, so `max(c)` is the first element in the list and `min(c)` is the last element in the list.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[-1])) (where a[0] is the only element in the list a, c[0] is the first element in the list c, and c[-1] is the last element in the list c)**
