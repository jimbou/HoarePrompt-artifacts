Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is either 2 or 1 and `j` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `t2` is greater than `t1` or not.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes either 2 or 1 depending on whether `t2` is greater than `t1` or not. The value of `j` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `t2` is greater than `t1` or not.
