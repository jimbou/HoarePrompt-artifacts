Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop counter `k` has reached the length of list `a`, the temporary variables `t1` and `t2` hold the absolute differences between the last elements of `a` and `c`, and the first elements of `a` and `c`, respectively. The answer `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` after all iterations. The indices `i` and `j` have reached the end of lists `a` and `c`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
