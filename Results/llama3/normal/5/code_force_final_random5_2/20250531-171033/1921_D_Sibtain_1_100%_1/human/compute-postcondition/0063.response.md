To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `k` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 2. The length of `a` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of the sorted list `a` and the ith element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1`, `t2` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is either 1 or 2**
