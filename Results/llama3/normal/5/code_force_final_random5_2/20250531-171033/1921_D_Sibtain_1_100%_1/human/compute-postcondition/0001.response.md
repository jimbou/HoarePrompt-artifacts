Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**

The code reads two lines from stdin, each containing multiple integers. The first line is split into two integers, `n` and `m`, which are assigned to these variables. The second line is split into a list of integers, which is assigned to `a`. The third line is also split into a list of integers, which is assigned to `c`. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. After executing the code, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, as two lines have been read and processed.
