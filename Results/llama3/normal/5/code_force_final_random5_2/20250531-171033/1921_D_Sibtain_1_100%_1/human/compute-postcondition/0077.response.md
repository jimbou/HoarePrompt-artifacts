Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the third input, `c` is a list of integers from the fourth input, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is 1, and the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations which is `ans` is being printed, and 0 is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their previous values, and the program continues to the next iteration.
