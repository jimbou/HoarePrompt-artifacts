Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is reset to 0, and the values of `i` and `j` are updated to 0 and 1, respectively. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
