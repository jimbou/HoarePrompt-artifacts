Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 2 elements, c is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, _ is 2, k is 1, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is the maximum of t1 and t2, i is 0 and j is 3 if t2 is greater than t1, otherwise i is 1 and j is 2.**

In this output state, the value of j has been incremented by 1. If t2 is greater than t1, then j is now 3, otherwise j is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
