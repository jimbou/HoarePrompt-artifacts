Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c`, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` which is `ans` is being printed, and 0 is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their original values, and the program moves on to the next iteration.
