Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, k is 2, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, ans is increased by the maximum of the new t1 and t2, i is either 0, 1 or 2, j is either 1, 2 or 3**

The code snippet provided calculates the absolute differences between elements at specific positions in the sorted lists `a` and `c`, and updates the values of `t1` and `t2` accordingly. The values of `t1` and `t2` are calculated based on the current values of `i` and `j`, which are either 0, 1, or 2, and 1, 2, or 3, respectively. The maximum of the new `t1` and `t2` is then added to `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
