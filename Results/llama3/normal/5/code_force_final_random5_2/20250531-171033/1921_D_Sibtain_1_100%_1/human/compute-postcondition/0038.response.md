Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of c, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c which is ans is being printed**

The code block reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, and two lists of integers `a` and `c` from the input. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` are updated accordingly. The value of `k` is updated to be equal to the length of `a`. The values of `t1` and `t2` are updated to be the absolute differences between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, and the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, respectively. The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`. The value of `i` is updated to be equal to the length of `a`, and the value of `j` is updated to be equal to the length of `c`. The sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, which is `ans`, is being printed.
