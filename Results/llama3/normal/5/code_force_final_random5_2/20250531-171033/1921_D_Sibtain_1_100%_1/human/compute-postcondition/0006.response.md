Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2. If the list a contains only one unique element, the list c contains only one unique element, and the first element of a is equal to the first element of c, then 0 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution of the program continues. ***
