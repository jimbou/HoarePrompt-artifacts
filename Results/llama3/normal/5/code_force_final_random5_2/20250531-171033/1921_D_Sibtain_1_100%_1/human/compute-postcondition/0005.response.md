Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2. The current value of a contains only one unique element, the current value of c contains only one unique element, and the first element of a is equal to the first element of c, and 0 is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables n, m, a, c, and _ remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2. The properties of the lists a and c, such as containing only one unique element and having the same first element, are still valid. Additionally, the code is currently printing 0. The only change is that the execution skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the continue statement.
