Output State: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `j`. The value of `k` is equal to the length of `a`, indicating that the loop has executed for each element in `a`. The value of `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, which represents the total maximum absolute difference between the elements of `a` and `c`. The values of `i` and `j` are equal to the length of `a` and the length of `a` plus 1, respectively, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of `a`.
