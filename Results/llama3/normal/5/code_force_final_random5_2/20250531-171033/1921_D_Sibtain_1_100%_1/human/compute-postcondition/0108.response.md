Output: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1, and the total maximum absolute difference between the elements of `a` and `c` which is `ans` is being printed**
