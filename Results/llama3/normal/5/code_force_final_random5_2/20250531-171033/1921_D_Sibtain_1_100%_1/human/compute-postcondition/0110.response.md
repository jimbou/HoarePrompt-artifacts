Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, stdin is empty, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c`, and the total maximum absolute difference between the elements of `a` and `c` which is `ans` has been printed for all test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the input has been fully processed, and the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` have been calculated and printed for all test cases. The loop variables `_`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` have reached their final values, and the input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
