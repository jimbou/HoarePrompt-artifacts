Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers from the third input, c is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for all iterations, i is equal to the length of a, j is 1, and the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for all iterations which is ans is being printed. If the lists a and c contain only one unique element and the first elements of both lists are equal, then 0 is printed and the next iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.**

The code sorts the list `a` in ascending order and the list `c` in descending order. The values of `t1` and `t2` are updated based on the sorted lists. The value of `ans` is updated by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for the current iteration. The value of `i` remains the same as the length of `a`. The value of `j` remains the same as 1. The program continues with the next iteration if the lists `a` and `c` do not contain only one unique element and the first elements of both lists are not equal. Otherwise, 0 is printed and the next iteration is skipped.
