Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that is not empty, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 2 times the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 3 times the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is 0 and `j` is 4 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 3 if `t2` is equal to `t1`, otherwise `i` is 2 and `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
