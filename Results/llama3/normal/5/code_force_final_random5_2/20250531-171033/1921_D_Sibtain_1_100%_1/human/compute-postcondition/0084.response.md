Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the third input, `c` is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` have been reset to 0, 1, and 0, respectively.
