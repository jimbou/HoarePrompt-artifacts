Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of the sorted list `a` and the (i+1)th element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The absolute difference `t1` is now calculated between the (i+1)th element of the sorted list `a` and the (i+1)th element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, instead of the ith element. The rest of the variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
