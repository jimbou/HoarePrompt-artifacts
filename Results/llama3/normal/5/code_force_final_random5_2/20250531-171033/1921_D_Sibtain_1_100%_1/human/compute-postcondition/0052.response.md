Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. The current value of `t2` is higher than the current value of `t1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same except for `j`, which is incremented by 1 and now equals 2. The relationship between `t1` and `t2` remains the same, with `t2` being higher than `t1`.
