Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, i is 0, j is 2, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, and t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c, and t2 is greater than t1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of j has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list a is still sorted in ascending order, and list c is still sorted in descending order. The absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c (t1) is still less than the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c (t2).
