Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers from the third input that must have at least 3 elements, c is a sorted list of integers from the fourth input in reverse order, _ is 2, k is 2, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is 2 times the maximum of t1 and t2, i is 0 and j is 3 if t2 is greater than t1, otherwise i is 1 and j is 2.**

The code snippet provided updates the values of `t1` and `t2` based on the elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c`. The value of `t1` is the absolute difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the element at index `i` in list `c`. The value of `t2` is the absolute difference between the element at index `len(a) - j` in list `a` and the element at index `len(c) - j` in list `c`. The values of `i` and `j` are determined based on the comparison of `t2` and `t1`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. The value of `ans` is 2 times the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, and `k` remain unchanged.
