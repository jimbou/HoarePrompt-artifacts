Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, which are the absolute differences between the first and last elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c` in reverse order. The other variables remain unchanged.
