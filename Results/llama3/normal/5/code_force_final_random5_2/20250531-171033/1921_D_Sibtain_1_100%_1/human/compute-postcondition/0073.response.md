The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If `_` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, the input contains multiple test cases minus 3. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again the input must contain multiple test cases minus 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is 1, and the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all iterations which is `ans` is being printed**
