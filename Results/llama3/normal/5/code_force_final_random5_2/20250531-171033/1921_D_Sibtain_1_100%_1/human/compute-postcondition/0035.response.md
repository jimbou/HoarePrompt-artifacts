The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`.

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` occur at the beginning and end of the lists.

The absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c` is `t1`, and the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` is `t2`. These are the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`.

The value of `ans` is the sum of `t1` and `t2`, which represents the total maximum absolute difference between the elements of `a` and `c`.

Output: **the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c (which is t1 + t2)**
