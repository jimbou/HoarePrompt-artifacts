Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, k is 2, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of the sorted list a and the ith element of the sorted list c in reverse order, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)th element of the sorted list c in reverse order, ans is the maximum of t1, t2 plus the maximum of t1 and t2, i is either 0 or 1, j is either 1 or 2. If t2 > t1, then i is either 0 or 1, and j is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, i is either 1 or 2, and j is either 1 or 2**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in reverse order, and assigns these differences to `t1` and `t2`. The values of `t1` and `t2` depend on the values of `i` and `j`, which are either 0 or 1, and either 1 or 2, respectively. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is either 1 or 2. The code does not modify any other variables, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
