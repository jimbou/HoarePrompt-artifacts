Postcondition: ***i is n, j is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, t is greater than 0. If there exists an index k such that l[k] equals k + 2 and l[k + 1] equals k + 1, then the number 2 is printed and the current value of j remains 0. Otherwise, the current value of j remains 0.***
