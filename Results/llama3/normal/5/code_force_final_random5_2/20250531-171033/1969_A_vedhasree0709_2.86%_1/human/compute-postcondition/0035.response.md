To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is 1, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 3, so that `n - 1` is at least 2, which is greater than `i`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 3.

The other variables, `j`, `l`, and `t`, are not in the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `t` is greater than 0**
