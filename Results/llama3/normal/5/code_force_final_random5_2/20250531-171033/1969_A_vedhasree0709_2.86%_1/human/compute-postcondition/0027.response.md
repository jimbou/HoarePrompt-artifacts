Output State: **i is 0, j is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, t is greater than 0**

The code snippet first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, replacing its original value. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, separated by spaces, and assigns it to `l`, replacing its original value. The third line sets `i` to 0, and the fourth line sets `j` to 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
