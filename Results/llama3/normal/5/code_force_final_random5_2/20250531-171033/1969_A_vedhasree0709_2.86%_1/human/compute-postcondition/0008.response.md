Output State: **`i` is either 0+1=1 or remains unchanged, `j` is 1 if `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, if `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1, then the number 2 is being printed, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is either incremented by 1 to become 1 or remains unchanged. If `i` is 1, then `j` is also 1. The values of `n` and `l` remain the same. If the first two elements of `l` are 2 and 1, then the number 2 is being printed. The number of test cases in stdin is t-1.
