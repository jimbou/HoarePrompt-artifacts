Output State: **if `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 3` and `l[i + 2]` is equal to `i + 2`, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The condition that was previously true for `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]` is now true for `l[i + 1]` and `l[i + 2]`. The value of `j` and the fact that the number 2 has been printed remain the same as in the initial state.
