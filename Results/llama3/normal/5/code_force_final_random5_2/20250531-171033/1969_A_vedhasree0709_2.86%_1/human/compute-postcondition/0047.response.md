Output State: **i is n, j is either 0 or 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, t is greater than 0. If there exists an index k such that l[k] equals k + 2 and l[k + 1] equals k + 1, then the number 2 is printed and j is 1. Otherwise, j remains 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive.
* The variable `j` will be either 0 or 1. If there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` equals `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` equals `k + 1`, then `j` will be 1 and the number 2 will be printed. Otherwise, `j` will remain 0.
* The variable `n` will remain unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop head and body.
* The list `l` will remain unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop head and body.
* The variable `t` will remain greater than 0, as it is not affected by the loop head and body.
