Output State: **l[i + 1] is equal to i + 3, l[i + 2] is equal to i + 2, j is 1, the number 2 has been printed, and n is greater than i.**

In this code snippet, the first line assigns the value 1 to the variable j. However, since j is already 1 in the initial state, this line does not change the value of j. The second line, break, is used to exit a loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it does not have any effect on the variables or the output. Therefore, the values of l[i + 1], l[i + 2], j, and n remain unchanged, and the number 2 has still been printed.
