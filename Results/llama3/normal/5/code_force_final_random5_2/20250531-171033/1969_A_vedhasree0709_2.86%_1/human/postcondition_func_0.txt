The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers. It then checks each test case for a specific condition: if there exists a pair of adjacent integers where the first integer is 2 more than its index and the second integer is 1 more than its index, it prints 2. If no such pair is found, it prints 3. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
