Output State: **l[i + 1] is equal to i + 2, l[i + 2] is equal to i + 1, j is 1, the number 2 has been printed, n is greater than i, and i is increased by 1. If l[i] is equal to i + 1 and l[i + 1] is equal to i, then the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of i is increased by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The relationship between l[i], l[i+1], and l[i+2] is shifted by one position, and the condition regarding the state of the program remaining unchanged or the same as the precondition is updated accordingly.
