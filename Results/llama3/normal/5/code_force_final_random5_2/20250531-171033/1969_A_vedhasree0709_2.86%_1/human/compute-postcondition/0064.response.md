The code snippet provided consists of two lines: `j = 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 1 to the variable `j`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, in this context, there is no loop for it to break out of, so it does not have any effect on the program state.

Given that the initial state is empty and the number 2 is being printed, we can infer that there is some external context or code not shown here that is responsible for printing the number 2. The provided code snippet does not affect this printing operation.

After executing the code snippet, the only change to the program state is the assignment of the value 1 to the variable `j`. The printing of the number 2 is not affected by the code snippet and is considered part of the external context.

Output State: **j is 1, and the number 2 has been printed.**
