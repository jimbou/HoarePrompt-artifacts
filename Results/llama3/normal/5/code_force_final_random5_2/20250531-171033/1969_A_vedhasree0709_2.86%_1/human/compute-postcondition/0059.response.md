Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `n` are integers, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `t` is greater than 0. If `l[i]` is equal to `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
