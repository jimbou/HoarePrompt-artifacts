Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 0, j is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the number 2 is being printed**

The code assigns 1 to `j`, and then encounters a `break` statement, which terminates the loop. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The list `l` and the value of `n` are not modified by the code. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The number 2 is still being printed.
