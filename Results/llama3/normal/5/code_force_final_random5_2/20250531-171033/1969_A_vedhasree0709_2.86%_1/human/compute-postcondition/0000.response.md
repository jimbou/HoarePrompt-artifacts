The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the variable `_` is 0.
