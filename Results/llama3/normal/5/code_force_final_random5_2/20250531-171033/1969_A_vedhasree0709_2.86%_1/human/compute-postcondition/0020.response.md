Output State: **`i` is either 1+1=2+1=3 or remains unchanged and `i` is less than `n-1`, `j` is 1 if `i` is 1 and 2 if `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1, then the number 2 is being printed. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, then the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3, or remains unchanged. The value of `j` is still dependent on the value of `i` and the elements of the list `l`. The other variables, `n` and `l`, remain unchanged. The condition for printing the number 2 is still the same, and the stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
