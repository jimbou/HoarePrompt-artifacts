To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `i <= n - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive
- `t` is greater than 0

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1, the condition is already satisfied without needing any adjustments to `i` or `n` because 0 is indeed less than or equal to `n - 1` given that `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the state of `i` or `n` for the loop to execute the first time. The states of `j`, `l`, and `t` are not relevant to the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `t` is greater than 0**
