Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
5
3 1 2 5 4

The program will print 2, but the correct answer is 3. The program only checks if there are two consecutive friends who are each other's best friends, but it does not consider other possible cases where at least two friends can come to the party.

In this case, friends 1 and 2 can come to the party if friends 1, 2, and 3 receive invitations. However, the program does not consider this case and prints 2 instead of 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
