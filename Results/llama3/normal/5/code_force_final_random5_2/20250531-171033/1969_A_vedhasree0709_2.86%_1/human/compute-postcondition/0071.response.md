Postcondition: ***l[i + 1] is equal to i + 3, l[i + 2] is equal to i + 2, j is 1, the number 2 has been printed, and n is greater than i. If l[i] is equal to i + 2 and l[i + 1] is equal to i + 1, then the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the program remains the same as the precondition.***
