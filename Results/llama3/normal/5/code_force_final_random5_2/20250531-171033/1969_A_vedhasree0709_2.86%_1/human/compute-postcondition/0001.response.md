Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 0, j is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been reduced by 1 because one test case has been processed. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, as specified in the precondition. The list `l` contains `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, as specified in the precondition. The variables `i` and `j` have been initialized to 0.
