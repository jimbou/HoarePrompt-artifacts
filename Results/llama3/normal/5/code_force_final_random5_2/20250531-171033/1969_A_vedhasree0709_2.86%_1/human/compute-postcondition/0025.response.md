Postcondition: ***i is n, j is either 0 or 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive. If l[i] equals i + 2 and l[i + 1] equals i + 1 for any i, then the number 2 is being printed. If j is 0, the number 3 is being printed. Otherwise, no additional output is generated. stdin contains t - (number of iterations) test cases.***
