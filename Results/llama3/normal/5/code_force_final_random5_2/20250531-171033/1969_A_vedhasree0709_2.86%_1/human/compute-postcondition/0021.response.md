Output State: **i is n, j is 1 if l[i] equals i + 2 and l[i + 1] equals i + 1 for any i, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, if l[i] equals i + 2 and l[i + 1] equals i + 1 for any i, then the number 2 is being printed, stdin contains t - (number of iterations) test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `l`.
- The variable `j` will be 1 if the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is true for any `i` during the iterations. This means that if the loop finds a pair of elements in the list that match this condition, `j` will be set to 1.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged, still being an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive.
- The list `l` remains unchanged, still being a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive.
- If the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is true for any `i` during the iterations, the number 2 will be printed.
- The number of test cases in `stdin` will be reduced by the number of iterations of the loop.
