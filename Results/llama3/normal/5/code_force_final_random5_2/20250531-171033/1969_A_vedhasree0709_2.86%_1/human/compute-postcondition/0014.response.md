Output State: **`i` is either 0+1=1+1=2 or remains unchanged and `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`, `j` is 1 if `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1, then the number 2 is being printed. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, then the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or remains unchanged, and it is still less than or equal to `n-1`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `l` are not affected. The conditions for printing the number 2 are still the same. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
