Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0+1=1 or remains unchanged and `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`, `j` is 1 if `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1, then the number 2 is being printed. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, then the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
