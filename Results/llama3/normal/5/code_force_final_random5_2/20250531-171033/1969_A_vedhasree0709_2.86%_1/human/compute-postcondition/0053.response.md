Output State: **i is 0, j is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, t is greater than 0**

In this final state, the values of `i` and `j` have been reset to 0, and the value of `n` has been updated to an integer greater than 1, which is the input value. The list `l` now contains `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, which are the input values. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, as it was not modified by the code.
