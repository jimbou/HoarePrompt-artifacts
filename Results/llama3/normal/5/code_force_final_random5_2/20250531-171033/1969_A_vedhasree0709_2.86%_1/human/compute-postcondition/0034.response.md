Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `t` is greater than 0. If the current value of `l[0]` is 2 and the current value of `l[1]` is 1, then the number 2 is being printed and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of `j`, `n`, `l`, and `t` remain unchanged. The condition for printing the number 2 and setting `j` to 1 is still dependent on the values of `l[0]` and `l[1]`.
