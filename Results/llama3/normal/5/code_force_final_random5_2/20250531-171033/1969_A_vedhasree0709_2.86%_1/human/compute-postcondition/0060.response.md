Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `t` is greater than 0. If `l[i]` is equal to `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is increased by 1. The values of `j`, `n`, `l`, and `t` remain unchanged. The condition that if `l[i]` is equal to `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the number 2 is printed, is still valid.
