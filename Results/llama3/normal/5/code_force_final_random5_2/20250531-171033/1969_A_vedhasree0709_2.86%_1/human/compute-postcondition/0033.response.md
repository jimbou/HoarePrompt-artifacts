Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `t` is greater than 0. If the current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1`, then the number 2 is being printed and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.***
