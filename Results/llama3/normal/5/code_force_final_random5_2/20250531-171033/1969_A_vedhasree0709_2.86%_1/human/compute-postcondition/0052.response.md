The only variable in the loop head is the loop counter `_` (which is not explicitly used in the loop body), and the input value that determines the number of iterations.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if the input value is greater than the current iteration count.

At the end of the last iteration, the input value is not explicitly stated, but we know that the loop has executed at least once. To execute again, the input value must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is n, `j` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, `t` is greater than 0, the input value is greater than 1**
