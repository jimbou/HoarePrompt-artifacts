Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, if l[0] equals 2 and l[1] equals 1, then i is 0, j is 1, and the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
