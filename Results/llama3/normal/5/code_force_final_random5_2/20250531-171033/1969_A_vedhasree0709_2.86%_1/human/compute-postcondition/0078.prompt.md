Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i <= n - 1:
        if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
            print(2)
            j = 1
            break
        i += 1
    if j == 0:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is n, j is either 0 or 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive. If l[i] equals i + 2 and l[i + 1] equals i + 1 for any i, then the number 2 is being printed. If j is 0, the number 3 is being printed. Otherwise, no additional output is generated. stdin contains t - (number of iterations) test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *i is n, j is either 0 or 1, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, t is greater than 0. If there exists an index k such that l[k] equals k + 2 and l[k + 1] equals k + 1, then the number 2 is printed and j is 1. Otherwise, if j is 0, the number 3 is printed and j remains 0. If j is 1, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *i is n, n is an integer greater than 1, l is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, t is greater than 0, if j is 0, then the number 3 is being printed. If j is 1, the loop breaks.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
