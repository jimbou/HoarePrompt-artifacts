The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0+1=1 or remains unchanged, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. `i` being either 0+1=1 or remains unchanged does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is either 0+1=1 or remains unchanged and `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`, `j` is 1 if `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `l` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, if `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1, then the number 2 is being printed, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
