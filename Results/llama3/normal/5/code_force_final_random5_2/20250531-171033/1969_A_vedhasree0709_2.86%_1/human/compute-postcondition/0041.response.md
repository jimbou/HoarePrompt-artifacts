To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3 to satisfy the condition. However, `n` being at least 3 does not guarantee that the loop will execute again, so we need to adjust `n` to be at least 4.

The other variables `j`, `l`, and `t` are not relevant to the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `t` is greater than 0**
