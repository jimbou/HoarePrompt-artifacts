Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `t` is greater than 0. If `l[2]` equals 4 and `l[3]` equals 3, then the number 2 is printed and `j` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
