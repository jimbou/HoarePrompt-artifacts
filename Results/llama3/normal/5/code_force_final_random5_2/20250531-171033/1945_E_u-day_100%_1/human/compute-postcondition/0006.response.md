Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `pos` is 1 if the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k` is no longer relevant, as `pos` is now directly assigned the value of `i`.
