The variables in the loop head are low and high, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables low and high. If low + 1 is less than high, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, low is either 0 or (0 + n) // 2, and high is either (0 + n) // 2 or n. For the loop to execute again, low must be less than high - 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of low and high to ensure this condition is met.

State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, low is less than high - 1, high is either (0 + n) // 2 or n, st is a set containing (0 + n) // 2**
