Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `pos` is either n-1 or -1, `low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is either `mid` or (0 + n) // 2 or n, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `st` is a set containing mid, mid and mid**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `low` and `mid` has been established, and the other variables maintain their initial conditions.
