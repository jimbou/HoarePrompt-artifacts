Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is `n-1`. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`). If the value of `arr[i]` (which is the last element in the array) is equal to `k`, then `pos` will be updated to `n-1`. Otherwise, `pos` will remain -1, indicating that `k` was not found in the array.
