Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `pos` is either n-1 or -1, `low` is 0, `high` is (0 + n) // 2, `st` is a set containing (0 + n) // 2 where the current value of arr[(0 + n) // 2] is greater than k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `high` has been updated to be the middle index of the list `arr`, which is calculated as `(0 + n) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and the current value of `arr` at the middle index is still greater than `k`. The set `st` still contains the middle index.
