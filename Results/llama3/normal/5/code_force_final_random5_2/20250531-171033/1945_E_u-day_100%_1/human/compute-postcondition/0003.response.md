Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `pos` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and the current value of `arr[i]` is still equal to `k`.
