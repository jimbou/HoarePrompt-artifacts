Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, low is 0, high is n, st is a set containing mid where mid is (0 + n) // 2. The current value of arr[mid] is greater than k***
