To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, we can focus on `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
