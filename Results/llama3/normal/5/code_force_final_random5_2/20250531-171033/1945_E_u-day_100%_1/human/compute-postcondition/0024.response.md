Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1. If arr[mid] > k, then low is less than mid - 1 and high is mid. Otherwise, low is (0 + n) // 2 and high is either (0 + n) // 2 or n. In both cases, st is a set containing mid and mid.***
