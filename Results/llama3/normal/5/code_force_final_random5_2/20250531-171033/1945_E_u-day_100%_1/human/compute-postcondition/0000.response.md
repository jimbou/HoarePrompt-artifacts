Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and pos is -1.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line calls a function `func_1()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, we assume it returns two positive integers, and `n` and `k` are updated accordingly. The second line calls another function `func_2()` and assigns its return value to `arr`. Again, since `func_2()` is not defined, we assume it returns a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and `arr` is updated accordingly. The third line assigns -1 to `pos`.

After executing the entire code block, the values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` are updated based on the return values of `func_1()` and `func_2()`. The value of `pos` is set to -1. The initial state's constraints on `n`, `k`, and `arr` are still valid, as the code does not violate these constraints.
