Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, low is less than mid - 1, high is either mid or (0 + n) // 2 or n, mid is (low + high) // 2, st is a set containing mid, mid and mid**

The code calculates the value of `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`, and then adds this value to the set `st`. The value of `mid` is now known to be the average of `low` and `high`, and `st` contains three values: `mid`, `mid`, and `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.
