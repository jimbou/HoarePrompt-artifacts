Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos`.
2. The program correctly finds the index `pos` of the target value `k` in the array `arr`.
3. The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the range `[low, high)` where the target value `k` should be.
4. The program correctly checks if the value at index `low` is equal to `k`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed.
5. If the value at index `low` is not equal to `k`, the program prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed. The program then prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the correct indices to swap to move the target value `k` to the correct position.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of a set `st` to keep track of the indices is unnecessary, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
