To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `low + 1 < high`. This condition depends on the values of `low` and `high`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `pos` is either `n-1` or `-1`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n`.
- `st` is an empty set.

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` must be true for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to satisfy the condition `0 + 1 < n`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. This is because if `n` were 1, `low + 1` would equal `high`, and the loop condition would not be met.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, low is 0, high is n, st is an empty set**
