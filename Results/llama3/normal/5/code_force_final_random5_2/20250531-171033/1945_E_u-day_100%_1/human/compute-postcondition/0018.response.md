Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `pos` is either n-1 or -1, `low` is (0 + n) // 2, `high` is n, `st` is a set containing (0 + n) // 2 where arr[(0 + n) // 2] is less than or equal to k**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to `(0 + n) // 2`, which is the mid value. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The set `st` still contains the mid value, and the properties of the other variables, such as `n` being greater than 1, `k` being a positive integer between 1 and `n`, and `arr` being a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`, are preserved.
