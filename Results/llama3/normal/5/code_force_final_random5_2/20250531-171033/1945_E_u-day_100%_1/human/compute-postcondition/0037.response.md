The code prints the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Based on the precondition, `low` is equal to `high - 1`, and `pos` is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred that `pos` is likely an index or position within the set `st` or the array `arr`.

Since `low` is equal to `high - 1`, `low + 1` would be equal to `high`. The value of `high` is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred that `high` is likely the upper bound of the range of integers in the set `st` or the array `arr`.

The value of `pos + 1` is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred that `pos` is likely an index or position within the set `st` or the array `arr`. Without more information about the value of `pos`, it is difficult to determine the exact value of `pos + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `high` (which is `low + 1`) and the value of `pos + 1`, which is likely an index or position within the set `st` or the array `arr`.

Output: **high (which is low + 1), pos + 1 (where pos is an index or position within the set st or the array arr)**
