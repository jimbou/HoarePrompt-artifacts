Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, low is 0, high is n, st is an empty set
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1. After the if-else block, if arr[mid] > k, then low is 0 and high is (0 + n) // 2. Otherwise, low is (0 + n) // 2 and high is n. In both cases, st is a set containing (0 + n) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1. If arr[mid] > k, then low is less than mid - 1 and high is mid. Otherwise, low is (0 + n) // 2 and high is either (0 + n) // 2 or n. In both cases, st is a set containing mid and mid.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, st is a set containing mid, mid and mid. If arr[mid] > k, then low is less than mid - 1 and high is mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
