Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, low is less than mid - 1, high is mid, st is a set containing mid and mid**

In this output state, the value of high has been updated to mid, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The relationship between low and high has also been updated, with low being less than mid - 1.
