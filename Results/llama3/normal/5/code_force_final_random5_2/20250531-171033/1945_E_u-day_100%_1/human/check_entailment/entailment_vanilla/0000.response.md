Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input using the `func_1` and `func_2` functions, which correctly parse the input into integers and store them in a list.

2. The program then finds the position of the target number `k` in the array `arr` using a simple linear search. This is correct.

3. The program then simulates the binary search algorithm on the array `arr`. It maintains a set `st` to keep track of the indices that have been visited during the binary search. This is not necessary for the correctness of the program but is likely used for debugging purposes.

4. The program correctly updates the `low` and `high` variables based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`.

5. After the binary search, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. Otherwise, the program prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed, and prints the indices of the swap.

6. The swap operation is correct. The program swaps the element at index `low` with the element at index `pos`, which is the position of `k` in the original array. This ensures that after the swap, `arr[low]` will be equal to `k`.

Based on the above analysis, the program is correct. It correctly simulates the binary search algorithm and determines the minimum number of swaps needed to make the binary search find the target number.

Correctness: **True**
