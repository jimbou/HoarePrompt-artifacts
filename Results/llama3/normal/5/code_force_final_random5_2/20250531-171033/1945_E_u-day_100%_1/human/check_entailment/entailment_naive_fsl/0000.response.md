Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem description. In the binary search loop, the condition for updating the `low` and `high` variables is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if arr[mid] <= k` instead of `if arr[mid] > k`. This mistake causes the program to incorrectly determine the position of the target element `k` in the array.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the target element `k` is not found in the array. In this case, the program should return an error message or a special value indicating that the element was not found. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
