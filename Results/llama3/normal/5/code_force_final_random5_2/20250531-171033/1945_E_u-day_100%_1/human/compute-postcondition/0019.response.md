Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1. After the if-else block, if arr[mid] > k, then low is 0 and high is (0 + n) // 2. Otherwise, low is (0 + n) // 2 and high is n. In both cases, st is a set containing (0 + n) // 2.***
