Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `pos` is either n-1 or -1, `low` is less than mid - 1, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `high` is mid, `st` is a set containing mid, mid and mid**

In this output state, the value of `high` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `low` and the original value of `high`. The other variables remain unchanged.
