Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, low is 0, high is n, st is an empty set**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `i`, and `pos` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces two new variables, `low` and `high`, which are assigned the values 0 and `n`, respectively. Additionally, an empty set `st` is created.
