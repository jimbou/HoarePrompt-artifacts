Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, st is a set containing mid, mid and mid. If arr[mid] > k, then low is less than mid - 1 and high is mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid.***
