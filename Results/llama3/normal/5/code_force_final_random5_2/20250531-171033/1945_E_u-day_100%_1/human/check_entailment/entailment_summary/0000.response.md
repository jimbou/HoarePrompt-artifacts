Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem where a binary search algorithm is applied to an unsorted permutation of integers. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, the target value `k` is found at the predicted position.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers. `func_2` converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list. `func_3` is the main function that performs the search and prints the result.

In `func_3`, the program first finds the position `pos` of the target value `k` in the list `arr`. Then, it performs a binary search on the list to find the predicted position of `k`. If the predicted position matches the actual position of `k`, the program prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 followed by the actual position of `k` and the predicted position `pos` incremented by 1.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the case where the predicted position does not match the actual position of `k`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
