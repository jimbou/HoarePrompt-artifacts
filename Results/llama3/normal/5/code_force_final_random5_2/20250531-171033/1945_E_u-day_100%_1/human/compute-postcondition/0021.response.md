Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1, low is less than high - 1, high is either (0 + n) // 2 or n, st is a set containing (0 + n) // 2 and mid**

The code snippet calculates the midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high` and adds it to the set `st`. The value of `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, which are both integers. Since `low` is less than `high - 1`, `mid` will be an integer between `low` and `high`. The set `st` initially contains `(0 + n) // 2`, and after the code execution, it will also contain `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.
