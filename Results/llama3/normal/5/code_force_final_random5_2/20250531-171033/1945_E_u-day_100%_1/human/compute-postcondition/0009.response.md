The code assigns the value of `i` to `pos`. Since `i` is 2, `pos` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 2, and `pos` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 2, and `pos` is 2.**
