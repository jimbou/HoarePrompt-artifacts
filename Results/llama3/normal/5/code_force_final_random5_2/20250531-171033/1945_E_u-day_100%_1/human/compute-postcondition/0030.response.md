Output State: **low is equal to high - 1, st is a set containing all integers from 0 to n-1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the low and high pointers meet at the same index, and the set st contains all integers from 0 to n-1. This is because the loop continues to divide the search space in half until low and high meet, and in each iteration, the mid index is added to the set st.
