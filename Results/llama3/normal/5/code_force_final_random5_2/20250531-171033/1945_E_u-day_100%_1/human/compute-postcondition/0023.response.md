Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `pos` is either n-1 or -1, `low` is (0 + n) // 2, `high` is either (0 + n) // 2 or n, `st` is a set containing (0 + n) // 2 and mid**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to `(0 + n) // 2`, which is the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.
