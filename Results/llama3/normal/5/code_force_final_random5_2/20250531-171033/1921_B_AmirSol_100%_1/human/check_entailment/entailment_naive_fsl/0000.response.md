Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum number of days required to test the hypothesis. The function `func_1` takes the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s1`, and the desired state of the boxes `s2` as input. It then calculates the number of cats that need to be added and removed to achieve the desired state.

The program uses the `sum` function with a generator expression to count the number of cats that need to be added and removed. The generator expression iterates over the range of `n` and checks if the current box in `s1` is empty (i.e., '0') and the corresponding box in `s2` is occupied (i.e., '1'). If so, it increments the count of cats to add. Similarly, it checks if the current box in `s1` is occupied and the corresponding box in `s2` is empty, and if so, it increments the count of cats to remove.

The program then returns the maximum of the two counts, which represents the minimum number of days required to test the hypothesis. This is because the scientists can perform one operation per day, and the maximum number of operations required is the maximum of the number of cats to add and the number of cats to remove.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the initial and desired states are the same (in which case the output is 0), and the case where the initial and desired states are different (in which case the output is the minimum number of days required to test the hypothesis).
