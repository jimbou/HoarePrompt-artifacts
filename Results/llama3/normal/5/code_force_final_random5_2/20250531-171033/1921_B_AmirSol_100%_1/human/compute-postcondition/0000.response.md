Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, cats_to_add is an integer equal to the number of positions where s1 has '0' and s2 has '1', cats_to_remove is an integer equal to the number of positions where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces two new variables, `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, which are calculated based on the comparison of `s1` and `s2`. `cats_to_add` counts the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1', while `cats_to_remove` counts the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'. These counts are then assigned to the respective variables.
