Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the maximum number of cats that need to be added or removed between two binary strings of equal length. It takes three parameters: a positive integer n and two binary strings s1 and s2, each of length n. The function compares the strings character by character and counts the number of positions where one string has '0' and the other has '1', and vice versa. It then returns the maximum of these two counts, representing the maximum number of cats to add or remove to make the strings identical.**
