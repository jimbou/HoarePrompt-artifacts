Output State: `number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, `i` is `size - 1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `sequence` list will have additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` appended to the end, where `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than the initial `number`. The value of `number` remains unchanged, and the loop variable `i` will be `size - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
