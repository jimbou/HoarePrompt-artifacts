Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `size` will be the smallest integer such that 2 to the power of `size` minus 1 is greater than the initial value of `number`. The values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.
