The code `sequence.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `sequence`. Since `i` is 0, the list `sequence` now has an additional element, 0, at the end. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with an additional element 0 at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, `i` is 0**
