You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers.
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: *number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers, a value has been returned which is the size of the generated sequence, and number is not equal to 0
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: `number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, `i` is `size - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `sequence` list will have additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` appended to the end, where `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than the initial `number`. The value of `number` remains unchanged, and the loop variable `i` will be `size - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `number` is a positive integer, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `result` is returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, where the element at index `-result - i - 1` is increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `number` remains unchanged, `size` remains the smallest integer greater than `number`, `i` is reset to 0, `result` is still returned by `func_1` with the same arguments, and `sequence` has all its elements from index `-result - i - 1` to `-result - 0 - 1` increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of the smallest integer greater than the positive integer `number` and the value returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, where `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, and the element at index `-result - i - 1` is increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the sum of the smallest integer greater than the positive integer `number` and the value returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, where `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, and the element at index `-result - i - 1` is increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
