Output State: `number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to size - 1 at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, `i` is size - 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `number` remains unchanged as a positive integer, the `sequence` list has been extended with integers from 0 to `size - 1` appended at the end, the `size` remains the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, and the loop counter `i` has reached `size - 1`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
