    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `sequence` list will have additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` appended to the end, where `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than the initial `number`.

    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `number` remains unchanged, `size` remains the smallest integer greater than `number`, `i` is reset to 0, `result` is still returned by `func_1` with the same arguments, and `sequence` has all its elements from index `-result - i - 1` to `-result - 0 - 1` increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.

    #The program returns the sum of the smallest integer greater than the positive integer `number` and the value returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, where `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, and the element at index `-result - i - 1` is increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence list. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer size such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than the input number, appends numbers from 0 to size - 1 to the end of the sequence list, and then recursively calls another function func_1 with the updated number and sequence. The function then modifies the sequence list by increasing certain elements by the result returned by func_1. Finally, the function returns the sum of the size and the result returned by func_1.
