Output State: `number` is a positive integer, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, `i` is 0, `result` is returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, where the element at index `-result - i - 1` is increased by `result` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `number` remains unchanged, `size` remains the smallest integer greater than `number`, `i` is reset to 0, `result` is updated based on the new values of `number` and `sequence`, and `sequence` has its elements at indices `-result - i - 1` increased by `result` for each iteration of the loop.
