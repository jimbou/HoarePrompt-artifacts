Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with an additional element 0 at the end and an additional element 1 at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number` and greater than 1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `sequence` has been updated by appending the value of `i` (which is 1) to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
