According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. If `size` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `number` is a positive integer and `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, which ensures that `size` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed, `i` is now 0.
State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, `i` is 0**
