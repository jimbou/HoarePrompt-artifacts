To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`. The loop will execute if `size` is at least 1. Since `i` is `size - 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the loop. The other variables, `number`, `sequence`, and `result`, are not directly related to the loop execution, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `result` is returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`**
