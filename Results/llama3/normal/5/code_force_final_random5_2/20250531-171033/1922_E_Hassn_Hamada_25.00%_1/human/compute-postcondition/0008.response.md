Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to 8, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size` is 3**

The code increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was 2, so after the increment, its value becomes 3. The values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
