Output State: `number` is a positive integer, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `result` is returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, where the element at index `-result - i - 1` is increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `number` remains unchanged, `size` remains the smallest integer greater than `number`, `i` is reset to 0, `result` is still returned by `func_1` with the same arguments, and `sequence` has all its elements from index `-result - i - 1` to `-result - 0 - 1` increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.
