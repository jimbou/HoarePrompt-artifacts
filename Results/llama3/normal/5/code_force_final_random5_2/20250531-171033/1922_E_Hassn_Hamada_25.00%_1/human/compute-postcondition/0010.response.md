Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to 15, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size` is 4**

The code increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was 3, so after the increment, it becomes 4. The other variables, `number` and `sequence`, are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same.
