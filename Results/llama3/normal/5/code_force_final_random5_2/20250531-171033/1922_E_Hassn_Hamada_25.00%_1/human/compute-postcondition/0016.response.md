To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `size`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number` and greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `size` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with an additional element 0 at the end and an additional element 1 at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number` and greater than 1, `i` is 2**
