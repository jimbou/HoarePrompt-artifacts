Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `result` is returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, where the element at index `-result - i - 1` is increased by `result`.**

In this output state, the value of `sequence` has been updated by incrementing the element at index `-result - i - 1` by `result`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the index `-result - i - 1` is valid because `result` is returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, and `i` is 0, so the index is within the bounds of the list `sequence`.
