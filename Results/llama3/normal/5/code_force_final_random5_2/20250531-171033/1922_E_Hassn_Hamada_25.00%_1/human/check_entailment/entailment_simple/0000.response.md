Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate the sequence.

The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`. It first checks if `number` is 0, in which case it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`. It then appends the numbers from 0 to `size - 1` to the end of the `sequence` list.

The function then calls itself recursively with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The result of this recursive call is stored in the variable `result`.

The function then iterates over the range `size` and for each `i`, it increments the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` list by `result`. This is done to ensure that the elements in the sequence are strictly increasing.

Finally, the function returns the sum of `size` and `result`, which represents the length of the generated sequence.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and calls the `func_1` function with the arguments `n - 1` and an empty list `result`. It then prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly generates a sequence with exactly X increasing subsequences, and the main part of the program correctly reads the input and prints the output.

Correctness: **True**
