Output State: **The program returns the sum of the smallest integer greater than the positive integer `number` and the value returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, where `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, and the element at index `-result - i - 1` is increased by `result` for all `i` from `size - 1` to 0.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the sum of the smallest integer greater than `number` and the result of a function `func_1` that takes modified arguments based on `number` and `sequence`. The `sequence` list has been modified by increasing certain elements by the result of `func_1`.
