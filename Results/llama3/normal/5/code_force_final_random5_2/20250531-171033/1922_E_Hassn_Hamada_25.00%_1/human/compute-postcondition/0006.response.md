Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to 3, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been updated to 2, which is the result of incrementing its initial value of 1 by 1. The values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code.
