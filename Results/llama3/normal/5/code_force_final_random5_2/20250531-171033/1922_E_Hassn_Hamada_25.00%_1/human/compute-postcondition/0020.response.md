Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with additional elements from 0 to `size - 1` at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`, `i` is `size - 1`, `result` is returned by `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`.**

In natural language, the output state after the function call is that the `result` variable is assigned the return value of `func_1` with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The values of `number`, `sequence`, `size`, and `i` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is called with the calculated argument `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the list `sequence`, and its return value is stored in the `result` variable.
