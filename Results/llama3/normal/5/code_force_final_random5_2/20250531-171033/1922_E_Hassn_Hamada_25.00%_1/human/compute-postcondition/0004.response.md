Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers, a value has been returned which is the size of the generated sequence, `number` is not equal to 0, and `size` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been updated to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The returned value, which is the size of the generated sequence, is still valid. The conditions that `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, and `sequence` is a list of integers, are still true.
