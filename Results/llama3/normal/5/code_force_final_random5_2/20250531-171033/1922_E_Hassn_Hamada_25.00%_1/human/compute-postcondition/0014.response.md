The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and size, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `size` must be greater than 1.
State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with an additional element 0 at the end, `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than `number` and greater than 1, `i` is 1**
