Functionality: **This function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence list. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer size such that (1 << size) - 1 is greater than the input number, appends numbers from 0 to size - 1 to the end of the sequence list, and then recursively calls another function func_1 with the updated number and sequence. The function then modifies the sequence list by increasing certain elements by the result returned by func_1. Finally, the function returns the sum of the size and the result returned by func_1.**
