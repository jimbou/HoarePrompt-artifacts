Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer, x is an integer equal to a, y is an integer equal to a, dx is an integer equal to b, dy is an integer equal to b**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning the values of `a` and `b` to new variables `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. Since `a` and `b` are integers and are odd, the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` will also be integers and odd. The ranges of `a` and `b` (3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99) are not explicitly changed by the code, so these ranges remain valid for `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` as well.
