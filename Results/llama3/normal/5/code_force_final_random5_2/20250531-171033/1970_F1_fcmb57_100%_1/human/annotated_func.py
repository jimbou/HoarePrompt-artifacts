#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and a and b are odd.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns two integers: x + dx and y + dy. x is an integer equal to a, dx is an integer equal to b, y is an integer equal to a, and dy is an integer equal to b. Therefore, the program returns two integers: a + b and a + b.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two pairs of integers as input, (a, b) and (c, d), and returns two new integers, (a + c) and (b + d).
