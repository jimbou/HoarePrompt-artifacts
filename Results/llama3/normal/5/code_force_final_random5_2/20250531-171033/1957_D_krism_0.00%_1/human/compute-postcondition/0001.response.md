Output: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The number of test cases is specified by a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) on the first line of the input, and a line of dashes ('-----------------') is printed**
