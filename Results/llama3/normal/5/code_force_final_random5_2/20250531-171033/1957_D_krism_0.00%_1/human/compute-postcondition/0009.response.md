Output State: **prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list `prefix` containing `n+1` elements, where `n` is the number of elements in the input list `arr`. The first element of `prefix` is always 0, and each subsequent element is the result of XORing the corresponding element in `arr` with the previous element in `prefix`. The input list `arr` is empty after the loop finishes executing, and the value of `n` remains unchanged.
