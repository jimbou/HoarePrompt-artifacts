The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than 32. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n-2`, `range` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`, `j` is less than 31, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`. If `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, then `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1. If `cur` has a 0 at the jth bit position, then the first element of the jth list in `suf` is incremented by 1.**
