Output State: **`ans` is 0, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, suf is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if cur has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, i is 0, range is 0, cur is prefix[0] which is 0, j is 32, and this is printed: a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, and suf is printed which is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if cur has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is initialized to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
