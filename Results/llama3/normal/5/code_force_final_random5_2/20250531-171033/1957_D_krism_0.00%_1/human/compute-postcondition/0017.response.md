The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range. If `i` is less than the range, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, range is 32. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
