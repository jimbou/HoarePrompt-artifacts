Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, suf is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if cur has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, i is 0, range is 0, cur is prefix[0] which is 0, j is 32, and this is printed: a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, and suf is printed which is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if cur has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    y = arr[i - 1]
    k = y.bit_length() - 1
    ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
    c = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if c >> j & 1:
            pre[j][1] += 1
            suf[j][1] -= 1
        else:
            pre[j][0] += 1
            suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed 32 times, and the `pre` and `suf` lists have been updated accordingly. The values of `ans`, `prefix`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `range`, `cur`, `32`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `j` has reached 32, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: j is 32, pre[j][0] and pre[j][1] are increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, suf[j][0] and suf[j][1] are decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: j is 32, 32 is greater than or equal to 32, i is 33, n is greater than 33, y is the value of arr[i - 1], k is y.bit_length() - 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], c is the value of prefix[i]. If the jth bit of c is 1, pre[j][0] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 plus 32, suf[j][0] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 minus 32. If the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][0] is increased by 31, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1, suf[j][0] is decreased by 31, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
