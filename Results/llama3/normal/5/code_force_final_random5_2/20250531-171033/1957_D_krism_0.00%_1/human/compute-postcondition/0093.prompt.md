Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans is 0, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive and must be greater than 0, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, suf is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if cur has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, i is 1, range is 0, cur is prefix[0] which is 0, j is 32, and this is printed: a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, and suf is printed which is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if cur has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, y is 0, k is -1, and c is prefix[1] which is v1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program executes an if-else block based on the condition `c >> j & 1`. If the condition is true, the program updates the `pre` list by adding one 1 and two zeros to the jth list, and updates the `suf` list accordingly. If the condition is false, the program updates the `pre` list by adding one 1 and one zero to the first list, and updates the `suf` list accordingly. In both cases, the program prints the updated `pre` and `suf` lists, and the values of `ans`, `prefix`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `range`, `cur`, `j`, `32`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`pre` and `suf` lists have been updated according to the condition `c >> j & 1`, `ans`, `prefix`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `range`, `cur`, `32`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1. If `c >> j & 1` is true, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`pre` and `suf` lists have been updated according to the condition `c >> j & 1`, `ans`, `prefix`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `range`, `cur`, `32`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than 32. If `c >> j & 1` is true, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
