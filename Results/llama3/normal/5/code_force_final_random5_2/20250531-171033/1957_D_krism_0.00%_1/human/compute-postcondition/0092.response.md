Postcondition: ***`pre` and `suf` lists have been updated according to the condition `c >> j & 1`, `ans`, `prefix`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `range`, `cur`, `32`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than 32. If `c >> j & 1` is true, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.***
