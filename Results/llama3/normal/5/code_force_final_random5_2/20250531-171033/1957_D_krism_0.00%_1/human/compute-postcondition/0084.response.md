Postcondition: **The program executes an if-else block based on the condition `c >> j & 1`. If the condition is true, the program updates the `pre` list by adding one 1 and two zeros to the jth list, and updates the `suf` list accordingly. If the condition is false, the program updates the `pre` list by adding one 1 and one zero to the first list, and updates the `suf` list accordingly. In both cases, the program prints the updated `pre` and `suf` lists, and the values of `ans`, `prefix`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `range`, `cur`, `j`, `32`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
