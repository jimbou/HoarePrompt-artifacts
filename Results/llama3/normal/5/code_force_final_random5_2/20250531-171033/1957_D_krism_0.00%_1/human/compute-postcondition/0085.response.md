The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value less than 32. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`pre` and `suf` lists have been updated according to the condition `c >> j & 1`, `ans`, `prefix`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `range`, `cur`, `32`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1**
