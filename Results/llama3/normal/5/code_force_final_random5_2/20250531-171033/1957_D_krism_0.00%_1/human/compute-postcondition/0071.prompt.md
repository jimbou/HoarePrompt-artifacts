Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, i is 31, range is 32
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    cur = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if cur >> j & 1:
            suf[j][1] += 1
        else:
            suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]` which is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn`, `j` is 32.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n-1`, `range` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-1]`, `j` is 32. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. If the jth bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n-2`, `range` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`, `j` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`. The value of `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first element of the jth list in `suf` is incremented by 1. The first element of the jth list in `suf` is incremented by 1 if `cur` has a 0 at the jth bit position.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
