Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the jth list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]` which is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position (i.e., the jth bit of `cur` is 1).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the jth list in `suf` now contains two ones instead of two zeros, indicating that the jth bit of `cur` is 1.
