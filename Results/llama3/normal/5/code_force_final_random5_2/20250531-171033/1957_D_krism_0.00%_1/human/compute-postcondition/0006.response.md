Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing four elements: 0, `v`, `w`, and `v ^ w`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, and `v` is the second element in the list.**

In this output state, the list `prefix` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list (which is `w`). The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
