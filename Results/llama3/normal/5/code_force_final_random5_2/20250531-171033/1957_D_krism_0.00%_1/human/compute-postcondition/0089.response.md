The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be less than 32.
State: **`pre` and `suf` lists have been updated according to the condition `c >> j & 1`, `ans`, `prefix`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `range`, `cur`, `32`, `y`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 and is less than 32**
