Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]` which is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn`, `j` is 32.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the `suf` list. The `suf` list now contains 32 lists, where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one, except for the second list which contains one zero and two ones if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one, except for the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros. The `range` variable is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The `j` variable is now 32, indicating that the loop has executed 32 times.
