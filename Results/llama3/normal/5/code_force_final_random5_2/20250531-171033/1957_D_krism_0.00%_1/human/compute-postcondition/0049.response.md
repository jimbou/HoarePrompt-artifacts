The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than 32. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n-1`, `range` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-1]`, `j` is less than 31. If the jth bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. If the jth bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `suf[j][1]` or `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1 depending on the value of the jth bit of `cur`.**
