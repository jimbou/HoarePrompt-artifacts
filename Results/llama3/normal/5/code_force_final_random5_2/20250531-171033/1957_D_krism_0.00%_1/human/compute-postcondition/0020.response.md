The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1 and `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 31 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is 32**
