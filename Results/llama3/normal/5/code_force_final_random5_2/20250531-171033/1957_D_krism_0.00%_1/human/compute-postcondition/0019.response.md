Output State: **prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, i is 31, range is 32**

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is a state where the prefix list remains unchanged, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, n remains an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is still an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 (indicating that the loop has executed 32 times) and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, suf is still a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements are printed, i is 31 (indicating that the loop has executed 32 times), and range is still 32.
