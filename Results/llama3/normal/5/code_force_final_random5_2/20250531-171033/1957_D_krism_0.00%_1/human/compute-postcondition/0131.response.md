Functionality: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. Each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. The function calculates the sum of products of corresponding elements in two lists, pre and suf, which are updated based on the bitwise operations performed on the input integers. The final result is printed for each test case.
