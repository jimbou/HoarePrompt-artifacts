Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, prefix is a list containing a single element 0**.

In this output state, the first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable n. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line reads n integers from stdin and assigns them to the list arr. The third line initializes a list prefix with a single element 0. The values of n and arr are updated based on the input read from stdin, while the value of prefix is set to a fixed value.
