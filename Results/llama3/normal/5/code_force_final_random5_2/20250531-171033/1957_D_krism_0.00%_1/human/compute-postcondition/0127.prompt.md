Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: j is 32, pre[j][0] and pre[j][1] are increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, suf[j][0] and suf[j][1] are decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, i is 33, n is greater than 33, y is the value of arr[i - 1], k is y.bit_length() - 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], c is the value of prefix[i]
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *j is 0, 32 is greater than 0, i is 33, n is greater than 33, y is the value of arr[i - 1], k is y.bit_length() - 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], c is the value of prefix[i]. If the jth bit of c is 1, pre[j][0] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 plus 1, suf[j][0] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 minus 1. If the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][0] is increased by 1, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1, suf[j][0] is decreased by 1, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: j is 1, 32 is greater than 1, i is 33, n is greater than 33, y is the value of arr[i - 1], k is y.bit_length() - 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], c is the value of prefix[i]. If the jth bit of c is 1, pre[j][0] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 plus 2, suf[j][0] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 minus 2. If the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][0] is increased by 1, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1, suf[j][0] is decreased by 1, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: j is 2, 32 is greater than 2, i is 33, n is greater than 33, y is the value of arr[i - 1], k is y.bit_length() - 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], c is the value of prefix[i]. If the jth bit of c is 1, pre[j][0] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 plus 3, suf[j][0] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 minus 3. If the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][0] is increased by 2, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1, suf[j][0] is decreased by 2, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1. Otherwise, pre[2][0] is increased by 1, suf[2][0] is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
