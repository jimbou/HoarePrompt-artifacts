Output State: **prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed**

The code initializes two lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists, each of which contains two zeros. This is the only change made by the code. The initial state's information about `prefix`, `stdin`, `n`, `arr`, and the printed lists remains valid, as the code does not modify these variables.
