Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `32` is greater than 0, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` are increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, `i` is 33, `n` is greater than 33, `y` is the value of arr[i - 1], `k` is y.bit_length() - 1, `ans` is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], `c` is the value of prefix[i]. The current value of the jth bit of c is 1.***
