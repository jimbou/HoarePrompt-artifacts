Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 3 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is 2, `range` is 32**

In this output state, the value of `pre[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in the first list of `pre` containing 3 instead of 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
