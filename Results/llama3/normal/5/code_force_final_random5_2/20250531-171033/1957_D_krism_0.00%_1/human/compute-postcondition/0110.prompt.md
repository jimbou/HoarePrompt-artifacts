Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed 32 times, and the `pre` and `suf` lists have been updated accordingly. The values of `prefix`, `arr`, `range`, `cur`, `n` remain unchanged. `j` is 32, `i` is 33, `ans` is increased by the sum of the products of the first elements of `pre[k]` and `suf[k]` and the second elements of `pre[k]` and `suf[k]`, where `k` is the bit length of `arr[i - 1]` minus 1. `y` is the value of `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, and `c` is the value of `prefix[i]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *j is 0, c is at least 1. If the least significant bit of c is 1, pre[0][1] is incremented by 1 and suf[0][1] is decremented by 1. If the least significant bit of c is 0, pre[0][0] is increased by 1 and suf[0][0] is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: j is 1, c is at least 1. If the least significant bit of c is 1, pre[j][1] and pre[0][1] are incremented by 1 and suf[j][1] and suf[0][1] are decremented by 1. If the least significant bit of c is 0, pre[j][0] and pre[0][0] are incremented by 1 and suf[j][0] and suf[0][0] are decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *j is 2, c is at least 1. If the third bit of c is 1, then pre[j][1] is one more than its original value and suf[j][1] is one less than its original value. Otherwise, pre[j][0] is one more than its original value and suf[j][0] is one less than its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
