Output State: **j is 0, c has a least significant bit (bit 0) that is 1, pre[0][1] is incremented by 1, suf[0][1] is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `c` is not directly modified by the code, so its least significant bit (bit 0) remains 1. The code increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1 and decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is 0, this means that `pre[0][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[0][1]` is decremented by 1.
