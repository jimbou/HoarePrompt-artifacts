Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains one 1 and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the third list which now contains one 1 and two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n-2`, `range` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`, `j` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`. The value of `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if `cur` has a 1 at the jth bit position, otherwise the first element of the jth list in `suf` is incremented by 1. The first element of the jth list in `suf` is incremented by 1 if `cur` has a 0 at the jth bit position.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates 32 times, and in each iteration, it checks the jth bit position of `cur` and increments the corresponding element in the `suf` list. After the loop finishes, the `suf` list contains the correct counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position in `cur`.
