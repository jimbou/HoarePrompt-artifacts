Output State: **j is 2, 32 is greater than 2, i is 33, n is greater than 33, y is the value of arr[i - 1], k is y.bit_length() - 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], c is the value of prefix[i]. If the jth bit of c is 1, pre[j][0] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 plus 3, suf[j][0] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 minus 3. If the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][0] is increased by 2, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1, suf[j][0] is decreased by 2, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1.**
