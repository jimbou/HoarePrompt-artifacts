Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[n]` which is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn`**

In this output state, the value of `cur` is assigned the value of `prefix[i]`, where `i` is `n`. Since `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, the value of `cur` is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
