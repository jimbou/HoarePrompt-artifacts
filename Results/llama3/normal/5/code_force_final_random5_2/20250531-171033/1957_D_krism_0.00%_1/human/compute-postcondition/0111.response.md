The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 32, `n` is greater than 32. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 33.
State: **`j` is 32, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` are increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, `i` is 33, `n` must be greater than 33**
