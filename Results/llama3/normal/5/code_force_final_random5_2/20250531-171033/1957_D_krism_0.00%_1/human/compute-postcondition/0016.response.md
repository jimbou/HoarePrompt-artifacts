Output State: **prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 2 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, i is 1, range is 32**

In natural language, the output state is: The prefix list remains the same, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one, the value of n remains between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, the arr list is still empty, the pre list is updated such that the first list now contains 2 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, the suf list remains the same with all zeros, the printed lists remain the same, the value of i is still 1, and the range is still 32.
