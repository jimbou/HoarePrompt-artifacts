To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and the range `32`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the range `32` is at least 1. Since `j` is the loop counter, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`j` is 0, `32` is at least 1**
