The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `range`. If `j` is less than `range`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `range` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the jth list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is greater than 1, `cur` is `prefix[n]` which is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn`, `j` is 1.**
