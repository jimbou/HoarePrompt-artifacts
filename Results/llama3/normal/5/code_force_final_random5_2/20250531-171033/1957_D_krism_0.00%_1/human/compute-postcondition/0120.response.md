Output State: **j is 1, i is 33, n is greater than 33, y is the value of arr[i - 1], k is y.bit_length() - 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], pre[j][0] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, pre[j][1] is increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 plus 2, suf[j][0] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0, suf[j][1] is decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 1 minus 2, c is the value of prefix[i].**

In this output state, the value of `pre[j][1]` has been increased by 1, and the value of `suf[j][1]` has been decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
