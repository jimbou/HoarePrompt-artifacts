Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains two zeros and the rest contain one zero and one one except the second list which contains one zero and two ones, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is greater than 1, `cur` is `prefix[n]` which is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn`, `j` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the second list in `suf` which now contains one zero and two ones instead of one zero and one one.
