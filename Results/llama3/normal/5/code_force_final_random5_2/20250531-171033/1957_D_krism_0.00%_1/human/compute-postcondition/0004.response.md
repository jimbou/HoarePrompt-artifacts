The code `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])` appends a new element to the `prefix` list. The new element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list (`prefix[-1]`). 

Since `prefix` initially contains a single element 0, `prefix[-1]` is 0. Therefore, the new element appended to `prefix` is simply `v`.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, and `v` is still the first element in the list.

Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `v`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, and `v` is the first element in the list.**
