Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `arr` is an empty list, so it will be printed as `[]`.
* `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn. Since the exact values of v1, v2, ..., vn are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `prefix` list. However, we can describe the structure of the list.

Output: **[], [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn]**
