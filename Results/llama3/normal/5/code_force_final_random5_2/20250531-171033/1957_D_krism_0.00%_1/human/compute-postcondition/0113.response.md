To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the range `32`. The loop will execute if the range is at least 1, meaning `32` must be greater than 0. Since `j` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`j` is 0, `32` must be greater than 0, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` are increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, `i` is 33, `n` is greater than 33, `y` is the value of arr[i - 1], `k` is y.bit_length() - 1, `ans` is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], `c` is the value of prefix[i]**
