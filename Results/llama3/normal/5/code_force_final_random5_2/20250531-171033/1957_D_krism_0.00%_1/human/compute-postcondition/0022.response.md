The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `range` which is 32, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `range`. If `range` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[n]` which is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `range` is greater than 0 and j is now 0. 
State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists where the first list contains 32 and the rest contain one 1 and one zero, `suf` is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, `i` is `n`, `range` is greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]` which is `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn`, `j` is 0**
