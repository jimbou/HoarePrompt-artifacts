Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing six elements: 0, `v`, `w`, `v ^ w`, `v ^ w ^ x`, and `v ^ (v ^ w ^ x)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, and `v` is the third element in the list.**

In this output state, the `prefix` list has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list (`v ^ w ^ x`). The other variables remain unchanged.
