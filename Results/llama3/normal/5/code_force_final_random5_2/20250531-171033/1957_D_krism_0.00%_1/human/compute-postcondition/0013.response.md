To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and the range `32`. Since the loop will execute if the range is at least 1, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the range is indeed 32, which is greater than 0. Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `i` to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, suf is a list of 32 lists each containing two zeros, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1, v1 ^ v2, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn are printed, i is 0, range is 32**
