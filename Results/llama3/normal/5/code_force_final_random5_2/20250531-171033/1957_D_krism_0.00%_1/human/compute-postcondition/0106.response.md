To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of the variable `j` since it is the only variable in the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`j` is 2, `c` is at least 1**
