Output State: **j is 32, pre[j][0] and pre[j][1] are increased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively, suf[j][0] and suf[j][1] are decreased by the number of times the jth bit of c is 0 and 1 respectively.**

After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `j` will be 32, and the values of `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` will be increased by the number of times the jth bit of `c` is 0 and 1 respectively. Similarly, the values of `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will be decreased by the number of times the jth bit of `c` is 0 and 1 respectively.
