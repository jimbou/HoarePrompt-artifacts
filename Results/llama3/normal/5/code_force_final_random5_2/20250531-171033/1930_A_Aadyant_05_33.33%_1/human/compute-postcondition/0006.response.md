Output State: **`list2` contains the first and third elements of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), `a` is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and greater than 1, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `i` is 1, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, `list2` has been updated to include the third element of `list1` (at index 2*i) in addition to the first element it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged, with `list1` still being a sorted list of 2n integers, `a` being an integer n greater than 1, `num` being an integer greater than 0, `out` being an empty list, `numbers` being 0, and `i` being 1. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
