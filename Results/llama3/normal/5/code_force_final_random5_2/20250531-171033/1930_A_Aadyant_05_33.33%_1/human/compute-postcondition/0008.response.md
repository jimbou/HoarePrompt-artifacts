Output State: **`list2` contains the first, third, and fifth elements of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), `a` is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and greater than 2, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `i` is 2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the code has appended the fifth element of `list1` (at index 2*i = 4) to `list2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
