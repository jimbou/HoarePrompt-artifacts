To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `numbers` and `num`. The loop will execute as long as `num` is greater than 0. Since `numbers` is the loop variable, it should start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), num is an integer greater than 0, out is an empty list, numbers is 0**
