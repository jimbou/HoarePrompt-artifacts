Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-2 test cases, num is an integer greater than 0, out is an empty list, numbers is 0, list2 is an empty list, list1 is a sorted list of 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), a is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `list2` contains the first element of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), `a` is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), `num` is an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `i` is 0, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `list2` contains the first and third elements of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), `a` is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and greater than 1, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `i` is 1, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `list2` contains the first, third, and fifth elements of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), `a` is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and greater than 2, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `i` is 2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
