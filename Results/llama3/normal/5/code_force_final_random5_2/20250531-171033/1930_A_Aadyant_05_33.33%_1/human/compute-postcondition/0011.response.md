Output State: **`list2` contains the first, third, fifth, ..., (2n-1)th elements of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), `a` is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), `num` is an integer greater than 0, `out` is a list containing the sum of the elements in `list2`, `numbers` is 0, `i` is n-1, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `out` now contains the sum of the elements in `list2`, which are the first, third, fifth, ..., (2n-1)th elements of the sorted list `list1`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `list1` still being a sorted list of 2n integers, `a` being an integer n, `num` being an integer greater than 0, `numbers` being 0, and `i` being n-1. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
