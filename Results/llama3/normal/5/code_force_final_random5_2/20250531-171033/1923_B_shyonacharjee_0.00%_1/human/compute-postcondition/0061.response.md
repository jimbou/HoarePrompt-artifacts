Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, and `success` is `True` if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is less than or equal to `time_available`, otherwise `success` is `False`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `total_bullets_used` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `bullets_needed`. The value of `success` is also updated based on the new value of `total_bullets_used`.
