Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, t is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, _ is 2, i is equal to n, position is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, health is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in monsters, time_available is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in monsters, bullets_needed is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, total_bullets_used is 0, success is True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether success is True or False, stdin contains 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False. If `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, and `success` is `True` if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is less than or equal to `time_available`, otherwise `success` is `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
