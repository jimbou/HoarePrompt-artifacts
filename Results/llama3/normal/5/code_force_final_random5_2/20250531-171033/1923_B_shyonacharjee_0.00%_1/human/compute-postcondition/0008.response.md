Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `i` is 0, `position` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`. If `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total_bullets_used` has been increased by the number of bullets needed to defeat the current monster. All other variables remain unchanged, including the state of `success`, which is still False if the total bullets used exceeds the time available, and unchanged otherwise.
