Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, t is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, _ is 2, i is 2, position is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, health is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in monsters, time_available is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in monsters, bullets_needed is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, total_bullets_used is total_bullets_used + bullets_needed. If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, success is True.***
