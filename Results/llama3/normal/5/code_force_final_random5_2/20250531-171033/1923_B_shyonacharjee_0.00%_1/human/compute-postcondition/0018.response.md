Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `i` is 2, `position` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is increased by the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `success` is False if `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, otherwise `success` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `total_bullets_used` has been increased by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is the first element of the first tuple in the `monsters` list. The value of `success` is still dependent on the comparison between `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` and `time_available`.
