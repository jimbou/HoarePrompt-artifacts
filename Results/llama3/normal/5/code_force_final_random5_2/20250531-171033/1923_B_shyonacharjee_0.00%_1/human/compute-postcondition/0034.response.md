Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4, _ is 1, i is less than n and i is increased by 1 so i is i plus 1, position is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, health is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in monsters, time_available is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in monsters, bullets_needed is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, total_bullets_used is the sum of the previous value of total_bullets_used and bullets_needed, and success is True if total_bullets_used is less than or equal to time_available, otherwise success is False. If total_bullets_used plus bullets_needed is greater than time_available, then success is False.**
