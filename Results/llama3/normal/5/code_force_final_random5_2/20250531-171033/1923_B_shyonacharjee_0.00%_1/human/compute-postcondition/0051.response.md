Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False. If `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total_bullets_used` has been increased by the value of `bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged. The program continues to check if the total bullets used plus the bullets needed is greater than the time available. If it is, the program prints 'NO' and sets `success` to False. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used`.
