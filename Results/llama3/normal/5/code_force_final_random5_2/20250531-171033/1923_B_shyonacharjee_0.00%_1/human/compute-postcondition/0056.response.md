Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total_bullets_used` has been updated by adding `bullets_needed` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The program will continue with the updated value of `total_bullets_used` and the same values for the other variables. If the updated `total_bullets_used` exceeds `time_available`, the program will print 'NO' and set `success` to False. Otherwise, it will proceed with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used`.
