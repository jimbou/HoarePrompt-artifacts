This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, a list of n integers representing healths, and a list of n integers representing positions. The function sorts the positions and healths based on the absolute value of the positions, then iterates through the sorted list. For each iteration, it calculates the distance, time available, and bullets needed. If the total bullets used plus the bullets needed exceeds the time available, it sets success to False and breaks the loop. After the loop, it prints 'YES' if success is True and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not modify any external state or have any side effects other than printing to the console.
