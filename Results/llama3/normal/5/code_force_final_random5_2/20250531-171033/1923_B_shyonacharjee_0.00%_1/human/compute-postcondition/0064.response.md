Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, `_` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `bullets_needed` for each iteration, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` at any point during the loop, then `success` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used` and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False.**
