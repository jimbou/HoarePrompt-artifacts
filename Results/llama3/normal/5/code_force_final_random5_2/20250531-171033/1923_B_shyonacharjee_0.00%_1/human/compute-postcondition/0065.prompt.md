Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n <= n; x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
    positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    total_bullets_used = 0
    success = True
    for i in range(n):
        position, health = monsters[i]
        distance = abs(position)
        time_available = distance
        bullets_needed = health
        if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
            success = False
            break
        total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
    print('YES' if success else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is increased by the sum of all `bullets_needed` for each iteration, `success` is False if `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` at any point during the loop, otherwise `success` is True, and 'YES' is printed if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4, `_` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `bullets_needed` for all iterations, and `success` is True if `total_bullets_used` is less than or equal to `time_available`, otherwise `success` is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^4, `_` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `bullets_needed` for each iteration, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` at any point during the loop, then `success` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used` and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
