Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, _ is 0, n is greater than 1, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, i is 1, position is the second element of the first tuple in monsters, health is the first element of the first tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of the second element of the first tuple in monsters, time_available is the absolute value of the second element of the first tuple in monsters, bullets_needed is the first element of the first tuple in monsters, total_bullets_used is increased by the first element of the first tuple in monsters. If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
