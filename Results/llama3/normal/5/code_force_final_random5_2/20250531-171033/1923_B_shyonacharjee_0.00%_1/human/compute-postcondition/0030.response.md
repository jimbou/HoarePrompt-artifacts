Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `t` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4, `_` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the previous value of `total_bullets_used` and `bullets_needed`, and `success` is True if `total_bullets_used` is less than or equal to `time_available`, otherwise `success` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their previous values except for `total_bullets_used`, which is now the sum of its previous value and `bullets_needed`. The value of `success` is updated based on the new value of `total_bullets_used` and its comparison with `time_available`.
