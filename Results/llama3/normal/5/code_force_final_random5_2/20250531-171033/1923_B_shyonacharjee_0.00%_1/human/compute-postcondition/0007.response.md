Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, i is 0, position is the first element of the first tuple in monsters, health is the second element of the first tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of position, time_available is the absolute value of position, bullets_needed is the second element of the first tuple in monsters. If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
