#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n <= n; x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        
        total_bullets_used = 0
        
        success = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            position, health = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False
                break
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
        
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^4, `_` is equal to `t`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `bullets_needed` for each iteration, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` at any point during the loop, then `success` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `success` and `total_bullets_used` and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, a list of n integers representing healths, and a list of n integers representing positions. The function sorts the positions and healths based on the absolute value of the positions, then iterates through the sorted list. For each iteration, it calculates the distance, time available, and bullets needed. If the total bullets used plus the bullets needed exceeds the time available, it sets success to False and breaks the loop. After the loop, it prints 'YES' if success is True and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not modify any external state or have any side effects other than printing to the console.
