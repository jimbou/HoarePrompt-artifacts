Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `position` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is increased by the sum of all `bullets_needed` for each iteration, `success` is False if `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` at any point during the loop, otherwise `success` is True, and 'YES' is printed if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed**
