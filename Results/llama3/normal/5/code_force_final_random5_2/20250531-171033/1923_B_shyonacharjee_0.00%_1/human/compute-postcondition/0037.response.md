Output State: **n is an integer greater than i plus 1, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing an integer and an integer, t is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^4, _ is 1, i is i plus 1, position is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, health is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, distance is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in monsters, time_available is the absolute value of the last element of the last tuple in monsters, bullets_needed is the last element of the last tuple in monsters, total_bullets_used is the sum of the previous value of total_bullets_used and bullets_needed plus bullets_needed, and success is False**

In this output state, the values of `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` have been updated to the last element of the last tuple in `monsters`. The value of `total_bullets_used` has been incremented by the sum of the previous value of `total_bullets_used` and `bullets_needed` plus `bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged.
