Output State: **_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l remains unchanged, val is an empty list**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is as follows:

* The initial state of the variables _ (either 0 or m - 2), t (greater than 0), n (an integer that must be at least 2), m (an integer), a1 (an integer), a2 (an integer), l1 (a list of integers), l2 (a list of integers), l11 (a list of integers excluding a2), and l22 (a list of integers excluding a1) remains unchanged.
* The values of idx1, idx2, p1, p2, and l remain unchanged or are either greater than or equal to 0.
* A new variable val is introduced and is assigned an empty list.
