Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged, stdin contains no input, an input has been accepted but not stored in any variable.**

The code `input()` accepts an input from the user but does not store it in any variable. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin contains no input initially, it remains the same after the execution of the code.
