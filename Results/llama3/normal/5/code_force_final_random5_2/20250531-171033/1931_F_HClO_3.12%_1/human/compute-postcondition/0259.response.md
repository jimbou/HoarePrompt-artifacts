Output State: **_*_ is either m - 1 or m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, l is a list of integers, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least m or m, stdin contains either no input or m - 3 inputs: strings, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the execution of the break statement.
