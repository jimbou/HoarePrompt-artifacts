Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - `m` - 2 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list. Either `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative or `i` equals `n - 1`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, then `idx1` equals `idx2` if and only if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`. Otherwise, `idx1` is the index of the first occurrence of `a2` in `l1` and `idx2` is the index of the first occurrence of `a1` in `l2`. If `i` equals `n - 1`, then either `l1` does not contain `a2` or `l2` does not contain `a1`, or `a2` is not equal to `a1`. Additionally, `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`. If `m` is 2, then 'yes' is printed and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. Otherwise, the code inside the if block is not executed. `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers.**

The code reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains `t` - `m` - 2 test cases.
