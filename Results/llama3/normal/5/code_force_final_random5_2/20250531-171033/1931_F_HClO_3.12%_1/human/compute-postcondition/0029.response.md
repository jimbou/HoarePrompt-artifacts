Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - `m` - 1 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is not equal to `n` minus 1. The element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is equal to `a2` and the element at index `i + p2` in `l2` is equal to `a1`.***
