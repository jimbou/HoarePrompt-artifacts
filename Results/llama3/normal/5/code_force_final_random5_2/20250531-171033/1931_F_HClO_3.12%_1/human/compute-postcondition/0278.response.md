Postcondition: ***The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when idx1 is greater than or equal to 0 and idx2 is greater than or equal to 0, maintaining the initial state of all variables except for i, idx1, idx2, p1, and p2, which are updated based on the conditions l1[i + p1] equals a2, l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, and l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2]. Otherwise, the program continues to execute, maintaining the initial state of all variables, and updates idx1 and idx2 based on the conditions l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l1[i + p2] equals a2, and updates p1 and p2 accordingly, if l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2].***
