Postcondition: ***_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, l remains unchanged. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The current value of l1[i + p1] is equal to a2. Either l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1 or the current value of l1[i + p1] is not equal to the current value of l2[i + p2].***
