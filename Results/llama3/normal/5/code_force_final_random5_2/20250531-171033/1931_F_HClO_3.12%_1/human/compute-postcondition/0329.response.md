Functionality: This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on certain conditions. It accepts an integer t, followed by t test cases, each consisting of two integers n and k, and k lines of n integers. The function checks if the input data satisfies specific conditions and prints 'yes' if it does, and 'no' otherwise. The function does not return any value, and its sole purpose is to print the result of the input validation.
