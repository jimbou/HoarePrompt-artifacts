Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is at least i + 2, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is some value less than n - 1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is equal to i and p1 is equal to 1. Otherwise, idx2 is equal to i and p2 is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, n, m, a1, a2, l1, l2, l11, l22, i, idx1, p1, idx2, and p2 remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
