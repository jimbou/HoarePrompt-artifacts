Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2, val is an empty list, idx1 is not less than idx2, and idx1 is greater than idx2.**

The code inserts `a1` at index `idx2` in `l1`, making `l1` a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. It then assigns `l1` to `l`, making `l` a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
