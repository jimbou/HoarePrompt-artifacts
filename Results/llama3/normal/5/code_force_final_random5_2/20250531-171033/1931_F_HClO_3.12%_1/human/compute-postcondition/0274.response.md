Output State: **idx1 is i, p1 is 1, and all other variables maintain their initial state.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `idx1 = i` and `p1 = 1`. The first line assigns the current value of `i` to `idx1`, effectively updating the value of `idx1` to the current value of `i`. The second line assigns the value `1` to `p1`, updating the value of `p1` to `1`.

Since the initial state of the program is maintained except for the variables `i`, `idx1`, and `p1`, all other variables retain their initial values. The value of `i` is increased by 1, but this change is not reflected in the output state as it is not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet.

Therefore, the final output state is that `idx1` is equal to the current value of `i`, `p1` is equal to `1`, and all other variables maintain their initial state.
