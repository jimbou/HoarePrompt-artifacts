Postcondition: ***idx1 is either i or remains unchanged, p1 is either 1 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is either 1 or remains unchanged. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is i, p1 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, then idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.***
