Output State: **_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l remains unchanged, val is an empty list, and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

The continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
