Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different), `_` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `m` are assigned the two integers from the input, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). Additionally, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and the product of `n` and `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The stdin now contains `t - 1` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` followed by `k` lines of `n` integers. The value of `_` remains 0.
