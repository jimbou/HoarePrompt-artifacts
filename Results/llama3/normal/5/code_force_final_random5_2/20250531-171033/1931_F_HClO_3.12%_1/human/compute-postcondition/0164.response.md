Output State: **idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2` and sets `p2` to 1. Since `i` is either 1 or `m - 1`, `idx2` will take on one of these values. The value of `p2` is explicitly set to 1. All other variables, including `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, and `p1`, remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
