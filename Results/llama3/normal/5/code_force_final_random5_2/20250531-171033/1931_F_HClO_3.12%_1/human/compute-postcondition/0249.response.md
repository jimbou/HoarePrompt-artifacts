Output State: **_ is either m - 1 or m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, l is a list of integers, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least 2, stdin contains either no input or m - 3 inputs: strings. The current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 is less than n - 1. The current value of l1[i + p1] is equal to a2. Either l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2] or l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1.**

The code modifies the values of `idx1` and `p1`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, and the second line sets `p1` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, and `a2` are still valid, as the code does not affect these variables.
