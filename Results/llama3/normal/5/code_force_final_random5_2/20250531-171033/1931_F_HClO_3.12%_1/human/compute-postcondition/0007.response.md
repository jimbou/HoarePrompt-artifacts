Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different), `_` is 0, 'yes' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The program simply moves on to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
