Postcondition: ***`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, and all other variables maintain their initial state. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is 2, 'yes' has been printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes have been made.***
