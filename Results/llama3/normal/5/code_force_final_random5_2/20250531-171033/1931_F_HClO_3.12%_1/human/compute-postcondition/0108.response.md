Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val` has at least one more pair of values, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l`, `a3` is the next value from `val`, `l3` is the next list of integers from `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
