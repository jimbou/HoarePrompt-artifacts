Output State: **_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 1, l remains unchanged.**

The code modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The value of `idx2` is now equal to `i`, and the value of `p2` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
