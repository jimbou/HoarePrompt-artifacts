Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - `m` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. The current values of `l11` and `l22` are not equal, `_` is `m - 2`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is at least `m`, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by `m`. The loop variable `_` is set to `m - 2`.
