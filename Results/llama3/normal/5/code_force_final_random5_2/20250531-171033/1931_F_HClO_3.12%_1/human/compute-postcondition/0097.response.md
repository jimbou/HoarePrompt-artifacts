Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `stdin` contains `t - m - 1` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers that must not be empty, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`, Either `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative or `i` equals `n - 1`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, then `idx1` equals `idx2` if and only if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`. Otherwise, `idx1` is the index of the first occurrence of `a2` in `l1` and `idx2` is the index of the first occurrence of `a1` in `l2`. If `i` equals `n - 1`, then either `l1` does not contain `a2` or `l2` does not contain `a1`, or `a2` is not equal to `a1`. Additionally, if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the index `idx1` and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1`. Otherwise, if `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2`. The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, and this is printed: 'no', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables retain their original values and properties, and the conditions and relationships between them remain unchanged.
