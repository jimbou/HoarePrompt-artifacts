Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - `m` - 1 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list. Either `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative or `i` equals `n - 1`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, then `idx1` equals `idx2` if and only if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`. Otherwise, `idx1` is the index of the first occurrence of `a2` in `l1` and `idx2` is the index of the first occurrence of `a1` in `l2`. If `i` equals `n - 1`, then either `l1` does not contain `a2` or `l2` does not contain `a1`, or `a2` is not equal to `a1`. Additionally, `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`. The current value of `m` is 2.***
