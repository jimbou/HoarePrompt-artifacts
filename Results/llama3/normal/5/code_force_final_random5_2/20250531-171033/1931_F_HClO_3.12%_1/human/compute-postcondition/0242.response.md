Output State: **_* is either m - 1 or m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, l is a list of integers, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least 2, stdin contains either no input or m - 3 inputs: strings, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, i is 0. The current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n - 1.**
