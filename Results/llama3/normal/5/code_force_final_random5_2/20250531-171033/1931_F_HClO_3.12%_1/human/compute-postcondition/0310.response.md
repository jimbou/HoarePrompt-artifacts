According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `val`. If `val` has at least 1 tuple the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is either n - 1 or n - 2, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 tuple and the first tuple is (a3, l3).
State: **`i` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `idx1` is either i or -1, `idx2` is either i or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing m - 2 tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `m` is at least 2, `stdin` is empty**
