Output State: **i is either n - 1 or n - 2, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, l1 is a list with a1 inserted at index idx2, l is a reference to l1, and all other variables maintain their initial state. Additionally, idx1 is not less than idx2. The current value of idx1 is greater than the current value of idx2**

In this output state, the code has modified the list `l1` by inserting the value `a1` at index `idx2`. The variable `l` now references the modified list `l1`. The values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged. The relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` is maintained, with `idx1` being greater than or equal to `idx2`.
