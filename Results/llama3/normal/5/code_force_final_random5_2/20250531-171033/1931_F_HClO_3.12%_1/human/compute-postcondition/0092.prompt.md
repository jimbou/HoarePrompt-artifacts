Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers. Either idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative or i equals n - 1. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, then idx1 equals idx2 if and only if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1. Otherwise, idx1 is the index of the first occurrence of a2 in l1 and idx2 is the index of the first occurrence of a1 in l2. If i equals n - 1, then either l1 does not contain a2 or l2 does not contain a1, or a2 is not equal to a1. Additionally, if idx1 is less than idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the index idx1 and l is a list of integers equal to l2. If idx1 is greater than idx2, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers equal to l1. Otherwise, if l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2), l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers equal to l1. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers equal to l2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least 3, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 2 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers, where the last tuple contains a3 and l3, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least 3, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 3 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers, where the last tuple contains a3 and l3, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, _ is 1, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 4 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers, where the last tuple contains a3 and l3, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, _ is 2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
