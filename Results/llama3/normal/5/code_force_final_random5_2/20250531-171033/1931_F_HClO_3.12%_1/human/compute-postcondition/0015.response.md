The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least 4, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. The current values of `l11` and `l22` are not equal, `_` is 2**
