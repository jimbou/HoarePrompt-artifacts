Output State: **_ is m - 2, t is greater than 0, n and m are integers and m is at least 3, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 and idx2 remain unchanged, l remains unchanged, and stdin contains m - 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `m - 2`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still greater than 0, `n` and `m` being integers with `m` being at least 3, `a1` and `a2` being integers, `l1` and `l2` being lists of integers, `l11` and `l22` being lists of integers excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively, `idx1` and `idx2` remaining unchanged, and `l` remaining unchanged. The standard input `stdin` now contains `m - 2` inputs, which were consumed by the loop during its execution.
