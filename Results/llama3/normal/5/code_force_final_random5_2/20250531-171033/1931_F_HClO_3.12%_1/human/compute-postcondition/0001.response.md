The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different). So for the loop to be executed `t` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different), `_` is 0**
