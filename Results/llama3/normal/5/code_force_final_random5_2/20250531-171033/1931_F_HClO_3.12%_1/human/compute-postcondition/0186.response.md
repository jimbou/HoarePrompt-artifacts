Output State: **_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, val is an empty list, idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, a3 is an integer, and l3 is a list of integers. The current value of a1 appears before a2 in the list l3.**

In this final state, the code has modified the list `l1` by inserting the value of `a1` at the index `idx2`. As a result, `l1` now contains `a1` at the specified position. The variable `l` has also been updated to reference the modified list `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
