Output State: **idx1 is either i or remains unchanged, p1 is either 1 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is either 1 or remains unchanged. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is i, p1 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, then idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
