To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2, and `m` must still be at least 3.

State: **_ is 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing two tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input.**
