Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: _ is m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing m - 2 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `m - 2`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `m`, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The list `l` has been modified according to the conditions specified in the loop, and the list `val` now contains `m - 2` tuples of `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. Finally, the standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 0, m is at least 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing at least 1 tuple of (a3, l3), a3 is the first element of the first tuple in the list, l3 is the second element of the first tuple in the list, and if l3 is not equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_* is 0, m is at least 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing at least 2 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is the second element of the first tuple in the list, l3 is the second element of the second tuple in the list. If l3 is not equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_ is 0, m is at least 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing at least 3 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is the first element of the second tuple in the list, l3 is the second element of the second tuple in the list. If l3 is not equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
