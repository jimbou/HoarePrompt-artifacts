Output State: **`_` is m - 1, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer that must be at least 3, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to be at least 2 and 3, respectively, and are now integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
