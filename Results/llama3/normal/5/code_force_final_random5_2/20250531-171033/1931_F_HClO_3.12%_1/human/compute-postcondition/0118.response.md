To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute.

State: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n and m are integers and m is at least 3, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 and idx2 remain unchanged, l remains unchanged, and stdin is empty.**
