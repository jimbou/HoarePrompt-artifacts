Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is at least 2, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, i is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx1` and `p1`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, making `idx1` equal to 0. The second line assigns the value 1 to `p1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
