Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is at least i + 2, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is some value less than n - 1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is equal to i and p1 is equal to 1. Otherwise, idx2 is equal to i and p2 is equal to 1.***
