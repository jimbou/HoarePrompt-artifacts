The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n - 1`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is some value less than `n - 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is at least `i + 2`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - `m` - 1 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is some value less than `n - 1`.**
