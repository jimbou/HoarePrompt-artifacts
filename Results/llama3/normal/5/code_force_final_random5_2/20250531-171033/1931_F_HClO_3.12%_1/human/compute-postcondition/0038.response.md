Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - `m` - 1 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. The current value of `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and the current value of `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0. If the element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p2` is set to 1, and `i` remains 0. In both cases, the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is not equal to `n` minus 1, and the element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in `l2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. All other conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
