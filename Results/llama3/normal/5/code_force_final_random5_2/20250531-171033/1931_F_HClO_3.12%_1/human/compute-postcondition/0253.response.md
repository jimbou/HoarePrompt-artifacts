Postcondition: ***_ is either m - 1 or m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, l is a list of integers, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least 2, stdin contains either no input or m - 3 inputs: strings. The current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 is less than n - 1. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, then idx1 is i and p1 is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2, then idx2 is i and p2 is 1. Either l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2] or l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1. The current values of idx1 and idx2 are both greater than or equal to 0.***
