Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is at least i + 3, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is some value less than n - 1, idx1 is i, idx2 is i.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, effectively setting them equal to `i`. No other variables are affected by the code. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and properties as specified in the initial state.
