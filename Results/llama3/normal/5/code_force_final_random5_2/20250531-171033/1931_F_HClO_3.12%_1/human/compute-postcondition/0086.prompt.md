You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers. Either idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative or i equals n - 1. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, then idx1 equals idx2 if and only if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1. Otherwise, idx1 is the index of the first occurrence of a2 in l1 and idx2 is the index of the first occurrence of a1 in l2. If i equals n - 1, then either l1 does not contain a2 or l2 does not contain a1, or a2 is not equal to a1. Additionally, if idx1 is less than idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the index idx1 and l is a list of integers equal to l2. If idx1 is greater than idx2, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers equal to l1. Otherwise, if l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2), l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers equal to l1. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers equal to l2.
```
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
