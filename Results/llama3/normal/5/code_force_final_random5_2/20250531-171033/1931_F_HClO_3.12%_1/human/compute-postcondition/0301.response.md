Postcondition: ***`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, and `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a reference to `l1`. If `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, then `m` is one less than its original value, and if `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` and `l` is a reference to `l2`.***
