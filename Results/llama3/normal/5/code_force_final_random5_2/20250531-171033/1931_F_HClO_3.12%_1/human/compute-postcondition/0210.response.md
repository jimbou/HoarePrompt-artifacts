Output State: **_* is 0, m is at least 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing at least 2 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is the second element of the first tuple in the list, l3 is the second element of the second tuple in the list, and if l3 is not equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
