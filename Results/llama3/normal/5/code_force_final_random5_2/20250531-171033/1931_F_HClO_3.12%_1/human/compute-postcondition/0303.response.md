To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is at least 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` must be at least 3**
