To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for _ in range(m - 2):`

The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is an iterator variable. The range function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `m - 3` (since the range is exclusive of the end value).

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least 3, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `stdin` contains `t - m - 2` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers, where the last tuple contains `a3` and `l3`, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `_` is 1**
