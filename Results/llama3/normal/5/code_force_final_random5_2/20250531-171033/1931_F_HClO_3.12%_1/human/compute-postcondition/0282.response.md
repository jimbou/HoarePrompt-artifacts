Output State: **`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, and all other variables maintain their initial state.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `val` which is an empty list. The values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain the same, and all other variables maintain their initial state.
