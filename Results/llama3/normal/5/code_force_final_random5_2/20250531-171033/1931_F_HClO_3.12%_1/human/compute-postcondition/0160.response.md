Output State: **_* is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is i, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and l remains unchanged. Otherwise, idx1 is either i or remains unchanged, p1 is either 1 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either i or remains unchanged, p2 is either 1 or remains unchanged. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, if l1[i + p1] does not equal l2[i + p2], then idx1, idx2, p1, p2, and l remain unchanged. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. i is either 1 or m - 1, n is greater than i and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
