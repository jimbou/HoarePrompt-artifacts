The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `m - 2`, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is `m - 1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `m - 1`.
State: **`_` is m - 1, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input.**
