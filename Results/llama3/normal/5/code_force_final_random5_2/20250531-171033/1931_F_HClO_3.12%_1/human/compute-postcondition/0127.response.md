Output State: **_ is m - 2, t is greater than 0, n and m are integers and m is at least 3, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 and idx2 remain unchanged, l remains unchanged, and stdin contains m - 2 inputs, and 'no' is printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains m - 2 inputs. The only difference is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop, if any.
