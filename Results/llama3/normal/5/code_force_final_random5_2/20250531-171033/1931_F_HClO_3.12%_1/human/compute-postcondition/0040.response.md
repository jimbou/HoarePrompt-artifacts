Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is at least 2, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then idx1 is set to i, idx2 is set to i, p1 is set to 0, p2 is set to 0, and i remains 0. Otherwise, if the element at index i + p1 in l1 is equal to a2, then idx1 is set to i, p1 is set to 1, and i remains 0. Otherwise, idx2 is set to i, p2 is set to 1, and i remains 0. In both cases, the current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 is not equal to n minus 1, and the element at index i + p1 in l1 is not equal to the element at index i + p2 in l2. If idx1 and idx2 are both greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.***
