Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by k lines, each containing n integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case has two integers `n` and `k`, where `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), with the additional constraint that `n * k` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. Each test case also has `k` lines, each containing `n` integers, where each integer `a_ij` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and all `a_ij` are distinct.
