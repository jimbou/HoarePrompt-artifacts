Postcondition: **The program either prints 'no' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, or it continues execution without printing 'no' if the current value of `l3` is equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`. In either case, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged, and the relationships between them as described in the precondition are preserved.**
