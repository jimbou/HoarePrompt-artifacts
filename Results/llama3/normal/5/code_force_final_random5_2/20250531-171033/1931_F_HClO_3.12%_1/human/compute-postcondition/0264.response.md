Output State: **idx2 is equal to the current value of i, p2 is 1, and all other variables maintain their initial state.**

In this code snippet, the first line assigns the current value of `i` to `idx2`, effectively creating a copy of the current value of `i`. The second line assigns the value `1` to `p2`. Since these lines do not depend on the values of `n`, `p1`, or the loop/conditional structure, their execution does not affect the program's control flow or the values of other variables. Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of `idx2` and `p2`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
