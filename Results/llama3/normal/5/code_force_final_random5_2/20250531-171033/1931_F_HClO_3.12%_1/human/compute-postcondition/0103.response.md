Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged, `a3` is the next value from `val`, `l3` is the next list of integers from `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers from `l` excluding `a3`, 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
