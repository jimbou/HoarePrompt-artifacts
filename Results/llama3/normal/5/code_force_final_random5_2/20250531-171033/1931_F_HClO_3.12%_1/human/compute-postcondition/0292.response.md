Output State: **`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `m` is 2, 'yes' has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is still 2, and 'yes' has been printed. The program skips to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
