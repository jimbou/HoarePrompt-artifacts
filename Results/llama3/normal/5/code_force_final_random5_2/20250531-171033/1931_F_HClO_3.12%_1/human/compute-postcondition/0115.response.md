Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop, without changing any variable values.
