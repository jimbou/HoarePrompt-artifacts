Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m - 1, m - 1 is less than or equal to n, n times m - 1 is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers. Either idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative or i equals n - 1. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, then idx1 equals idx2 if and only if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1. Otherwise, idx1 is the index of the first occurrence of a2 in l1 and idx2 is the index of the first occurrence of a1 in l2. If i equals n - 1, then either l1 does not contain a2 or l2 does not contain a1, or a2 is not equal to a1. Additionally, idx1 is not greater than idx2. If l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2), then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers equal to l1. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers equal to l2.**

The code appends a tuple containing the integer `a3` and the list of integers `l3` to the list `val`. It then decrements the value of `m` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
