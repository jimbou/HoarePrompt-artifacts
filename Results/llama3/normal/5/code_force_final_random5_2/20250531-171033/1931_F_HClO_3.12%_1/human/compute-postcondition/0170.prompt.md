Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n and m are integers, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, l remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is i, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and l remains unchanged. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 or l2[i + p2] does not equal a1, then if both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of idx1, idx2, p1, p2, and l remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is i, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and l remains unchanged. Otherwise, idx1 is either i or remains unchanged, p1 is either 1 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either i or remains unchanged, p2 is either 1 or remains unchanged. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, if l1[i + p1] does not equal l2[i + p2], then idx1, idx2, p1, p2, and l remain unchanged. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *If l1[i + p1] does not equal l2[i + p2], then idx1 is either i or remains unchanged, p1 is either 1 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is either 1 or remains unchanged. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is i, p1 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, then idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
