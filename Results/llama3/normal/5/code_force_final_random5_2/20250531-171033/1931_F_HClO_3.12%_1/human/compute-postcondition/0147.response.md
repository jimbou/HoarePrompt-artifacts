Postcondition: ***_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is i, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and l remains unchanged. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 or l2[i + p2] does not equal a1, then if both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of idx1, idx2, p1, p2, and l remain unchanged.***
