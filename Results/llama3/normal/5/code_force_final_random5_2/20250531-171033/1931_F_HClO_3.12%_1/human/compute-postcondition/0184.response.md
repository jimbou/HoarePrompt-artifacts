Output State: **`_` is either 0 or m - 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, `idx2` is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, `p1` is either 0 or remains unchanged, `p2` is either 0 or remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers.**

The code assigns the first integer from the input to `a3` and the rest of the integers to `l3`. The input is expected to contain at least one integer. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
