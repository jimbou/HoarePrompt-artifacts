Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged, `a3` is the next value from `val`, `l3` is the next list of integers from `val`, 'no' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variables `a3` and `l3` still hold the next value and list of integers from `val`, respectively. Additionally, the string 'no' is being printed.
