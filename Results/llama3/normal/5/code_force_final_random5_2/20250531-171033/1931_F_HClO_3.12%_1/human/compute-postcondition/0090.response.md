The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 2 and `m` must be at least 4.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 3 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers, where the last tuple contains a3 and l3, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, _ is 2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers**
