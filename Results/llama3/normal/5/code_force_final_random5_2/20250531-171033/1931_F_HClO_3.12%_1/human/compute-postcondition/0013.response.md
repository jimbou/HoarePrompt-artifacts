To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `m` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least 3, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - 3 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. The current values of `l11` and `l22` are not equal, `_` is 1**
