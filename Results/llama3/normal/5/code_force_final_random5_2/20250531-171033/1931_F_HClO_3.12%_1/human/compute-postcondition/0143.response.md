Postcondition: ***_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. The current values of idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, then the current value of idx1 is set to i and p1 is set to 1. Otherwise, the current value of idx2 is set to i and p2 is set to 1. In both cases, l remains unchanged.***
