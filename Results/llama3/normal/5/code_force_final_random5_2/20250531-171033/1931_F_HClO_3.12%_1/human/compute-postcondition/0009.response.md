Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers.**

The code reads two lines from stdin, each containing two integers, and assigns the first integer of each line to `a1` and `a2`, respectively. The remaining integers in each line are assigned to `l1` and `l2`, respectively. Then, it creates two new lists, `l11` and `l22`, by filtering out the elements that are equal to `a2` and `a1` from `l1` and `l2`, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
