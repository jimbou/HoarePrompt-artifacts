Output State: **i is either n - 1 or n - 2, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (a3, l3) and the second tuple contains an integer a3 and a list of integers l3, m is at least 4, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a3` and the remaining input values to `l3`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not modify any variables. The second line appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the `val` list. The `val` list initially contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`, so after the second line, it will contain two tuples: the original one and the new one. The values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `m` are not affected by the code snippet.
