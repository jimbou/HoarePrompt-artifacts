The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. So `i` is either `m` or `m - 1` and `n` is at least `m` or `m` respectively.
State: **_*_ is either m - 1 or m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, l is a list of integers, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least m or m, stdin contains either no input or m - 3 inputs: strings. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 and idx2 are set to i. Otherwise, idx1 and idx2 are either i or -1, and p1 and p2 are either 0 or 1. If both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If the current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n - 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues to execute. i is either m or m - 1**
