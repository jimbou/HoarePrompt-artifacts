Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers. The current values of l11 and l22 are not equal, _ is m - 2, and 'no' is being printed. We skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we have skipped the current iteration of the loop and moved to the next one, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
