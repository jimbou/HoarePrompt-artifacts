The only objects in the loop head are variables  a3, l3, and list  val, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the val.  If the list has at least 1 tuple the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, _ is m - 2. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 tuple and the a3 is the first element of the first tuple in the list and l3 is the second element of the first tuple in the list.
State: **_ is 0, m is at least 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing at least 1 tuple of (a3, l3), a3 is the first element of the first tuple in the list, l3 is the second element of the first tuple in the list, stdin contains no input.**
