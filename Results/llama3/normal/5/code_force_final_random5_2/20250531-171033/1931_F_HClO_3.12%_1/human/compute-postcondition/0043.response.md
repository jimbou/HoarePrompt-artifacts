Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is at least `i + 2`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - `m` - 1 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is some value less than `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
