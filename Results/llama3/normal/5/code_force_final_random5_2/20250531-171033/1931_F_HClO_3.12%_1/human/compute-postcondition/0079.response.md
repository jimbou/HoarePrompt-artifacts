Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 2 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, l is a list of integers equal to l1, val is an empty list, idx1 is the index of the first occurrence of a1 in l3, idx2 is the index of the first occurrence of a2 in l3, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers.**

The code inserts `a1` at index `idx2` in `l1`, effectively modifying `l1` by adding `a1` at the specified position. This change is then reflected in `l`, which is assigned the modified `l1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as described in the precondition.
