The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least 3, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - 2 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. The current values of `l11` and `l22` are not equal, `_` is 0**
