Output State: **idx2 is i, p2 is 1, and all other variables maintain their initial state.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the current value of `i` to `idx2`, effectively updating `idx2` to the current value of `i`. The second line assigns the value `1` to `p2`, updating `p2` to `1`. All other variables maintain their initial state, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
