Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least 3, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 3 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers, where the last tuple contains a3 and l3, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, _ is 1, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers.**

The code reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to a3 and the rest to l3. It then appends a tuple containing a3 and l3 to the list val. The value of stdin is reduced by one test case. The values of t, n, m, a1, a2, l1, l2, l11, l22, and _ remain unchanged.
