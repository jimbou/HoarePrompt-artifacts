Output State: **idx2 is i, p2 is 1, _* is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2` and sets `p2` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is either 1 or `m - 1`. The other variables retain their initial properties: `_*` is either 0 or `m - 2`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a1` and `a2` are integers, and `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` are lists of integers with their specific properties.
