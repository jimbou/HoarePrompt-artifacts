The only objects in the loop head are variables  a3, l3 and list  val, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the val.  If the list has at least one more pair of values the loop executes again for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, a3 is the next value from val, l3 is the next list of integers from val. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least one more pair of values and the a3 is the next value from val and l3 is the next list of integers from val.
State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val` has at least one more pair of values, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l`, `a3` is the next value from `val`, `l3` is the next list of integers from `val`**
