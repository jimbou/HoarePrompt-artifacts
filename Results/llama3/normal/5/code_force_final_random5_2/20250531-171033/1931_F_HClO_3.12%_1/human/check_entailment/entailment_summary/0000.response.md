Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to. The program first checks if the number of screenshots (m) is 1, in which case it prints 'yes' because there is only one possible order. If m is greater than 1, it reads the first two screenshots and checks if the order of participants (excluding the author of each screenshot) is the same. If the orders are not the same, it prints 'no' because there is no possible order that both screenshots can correspond to. If the orders are the same, it checks if the authors of the screenshots are in the same position in the order. If they are not, it inserts the author of the second screenshot into the order of the first screenshot at the correct position and checks if the resulting order is consistent with all remaining screenshots. If it is, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

Correctness: **True**
