Output State: **`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, `m` is at least 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain unchanged.
