Postcondition: ***_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n and m are integers, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 and idx2 remain unchanged, l remains unchanged. If l11 is not equal to l22, then _ is m - 2, m is at least 3, stdin contains m - 2 inputs, 'no' is printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
