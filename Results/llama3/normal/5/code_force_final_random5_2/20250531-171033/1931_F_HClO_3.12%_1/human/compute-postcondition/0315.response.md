Postcondition: ***`i` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `idx1` is either i or -1, `idx2` is either i or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing m - 2 tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, and `stdin` is empty. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
