Postcondition: ***The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n - 1, or continues to execute otherwise, maintaining the initial state of all variables. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is set to the current value of i and p1 is set to 1. Otherwise, idx2 is set to the current value of i and p2 is set to 1.***
