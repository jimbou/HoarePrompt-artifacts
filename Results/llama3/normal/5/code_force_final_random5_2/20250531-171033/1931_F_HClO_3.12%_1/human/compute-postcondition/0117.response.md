Output State: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n and m are integers, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 and idx2 remain unchanged, l remains unchanged, and stdin is empty.**

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin, each containing a space-separated list of integers. The first line assigns the first integer to `a1` and the remaining integers to `l1`. The second line assigns the first integer to `a2` and the remaining integers to `l2`. The third and fourth lines create new lists `l11` and `l22` by excluding `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still greater than 0. The value of `_` is still 0. Stdin is now empty after reading the two lines of input.
