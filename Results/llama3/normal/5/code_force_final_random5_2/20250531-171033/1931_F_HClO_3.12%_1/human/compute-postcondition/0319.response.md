Output State: **`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, `m` is at least 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
