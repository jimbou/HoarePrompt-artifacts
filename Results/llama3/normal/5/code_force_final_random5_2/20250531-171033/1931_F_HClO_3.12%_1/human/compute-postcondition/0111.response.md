Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be integers, which are obtained from the input. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Also, since the input has been consumed, stdin now contains no input.
