Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is at least i + 2, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is some value less than n - 1, idx2 is equal to i, p2 is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2` and sets `p2` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `t`, `n`, `m`, and the test cases in stdin are still valid. The lists `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` retain their integer values, and `a1` and `a2` keep their integer values as well. The value of `i` is still less than `n - 1`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement remains dependent on the values of `i`, `p1`, and `p2`.
