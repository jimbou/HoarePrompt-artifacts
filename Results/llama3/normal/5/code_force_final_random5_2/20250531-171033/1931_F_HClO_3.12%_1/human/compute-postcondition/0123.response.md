Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers and `m` is at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, and `stdin` is empty.**

The code `input()` reads a line from the standard input and returns it as a string, but it does not assign the result to any variable. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged. However, since the input has been read, the `stdin` is now empty.
