Output State: **`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is a reference to `l2`. All other variables maintain their initial state. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**

The code inserts `a2` at index `idx1` in list `l2` and then assigns `l2` to `l`. The values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged. The list `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at index `idx1`, and `l` becomes a reference to the modified `l2`.
