Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is either m - 1 or m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, l is a list of integers, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least 2, stdin contains either no input or m - 3 inputs: strings.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_* is either m - 1 or m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, l is a list of integers, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least 2, stdin contains either no input or m - 3 inputs: strings. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 and idx2 are set to i. Otherwise, idx1 and idx2 are either i or -1, and p1 and p2 are either 0 or 1. If both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If the current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n - 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n - 1, or continues to execute otherwise, maintaining the initial state of all variables. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, idx1 is i, idx2 is i, and all other variables maintain their initial state. Otherwise, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when idx1 is greater than or equal to 0 and idx2 is greater than or equal to 0, maintaining the initial state of all variables. Otherwise, it continues to execute, maintaining the initial state of all variables, and updates idx1 and idx2 based on the conditions l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l1[i + p2] equals a2, and updates p1 and p2 accordingly, if l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n - 1, or continues to execute otherwise, maintaining the initial state of all variables except for i, which is increased by 1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, idx1 is i, idx2 is i, and all other variables maintain their initial state. Otherwise, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when idx1 is greater than or equal to 0 and idx2 is greater than or equal to 0, maintaining the initial state of all variables except for i, idx1, idx2, p1, and p2, which are updated based on the conditions l1[i + p1] equals a2, l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, and l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2]. Otherwise, the program continues to execute, maintaining the initial state of all variables, and updates idx1 and idx2 based on the conditions l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l1[i + p2] equals a2, and updates p1 and p2 accordingly, if l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2]. If l1[i + p1] equals l2[i + p2], the program continues to execute, maintaining the initial state of all variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
