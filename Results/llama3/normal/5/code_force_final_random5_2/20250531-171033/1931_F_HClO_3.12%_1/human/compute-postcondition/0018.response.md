Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers. The current values of l11 and l22 are not equal, _ is m - 2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `_` is equal to `m - 2`, indicating that the loop has executed `m - 2` times. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by `m - 2` due to the `input()` function being called in each iteration. All other variables remain unchanged.
