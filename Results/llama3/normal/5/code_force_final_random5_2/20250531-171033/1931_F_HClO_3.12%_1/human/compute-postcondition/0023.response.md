Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0.**

The code initializes four new variables: idx1, idx2, p1, and p2. The values of idx1 and idx2 are set to -1, indicating that they are not pointing to any specific index. The values of p1 and p2 are set to 0, indicating that they are not pointing to any specific position. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
