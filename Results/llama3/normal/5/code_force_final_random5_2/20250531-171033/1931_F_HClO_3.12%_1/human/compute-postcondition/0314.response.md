Output State: **`i` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `idx1` is either i or -1, `idx2` is either i or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing m - 2 tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `m` is at least 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin is still empty.
