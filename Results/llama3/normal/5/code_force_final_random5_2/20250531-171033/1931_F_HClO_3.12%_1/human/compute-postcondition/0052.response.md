Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is at least `i + 2`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - `m` - 1 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is some value less than `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1, otherwise `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.***
