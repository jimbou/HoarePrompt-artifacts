Output State: **_ is m - 1, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer that must be at least 3, stdin contains no input.**

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin, each containing an integer followed by a list of integers. The first line assigns the integer value to `a1` and the list of integers to `l1`. The second line assigns the integer value to `a2` and the list of integers to `l2`. The code then creates two new lists, `l11` and `l22`, by excluding `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The list `l` is not modified in this code block. The list `val` is not modified in this code block. The values of `a3`, `l3`, `n`, and `m` are not modified in this code block. Stdin is now empty.
