Output State: **_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers that is a modified version of l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is an empty list. The current value of idx1 is less than the current value of idx2.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that `l2` has been modified by inserting `a2` at index `idx1`, and this modified list is assigned to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
