To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m - 2` is at least 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3. Also, `_` is the loop variable, so it should be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the range.

State: **_ is 0, m is at least 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is an empty list if idx1 < idx2 or idx1 > idx2, otherwise val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3)**
