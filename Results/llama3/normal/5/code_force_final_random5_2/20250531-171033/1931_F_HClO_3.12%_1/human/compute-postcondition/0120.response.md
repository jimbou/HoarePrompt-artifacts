To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` needs to remain the same.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `m` is at least 3 (no change)

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **_ is 1, t is greater than 0, n and m are integers and m is at least 3, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 and idx2 remain unchanged, l remains unchanged, and stdin is empty.**
