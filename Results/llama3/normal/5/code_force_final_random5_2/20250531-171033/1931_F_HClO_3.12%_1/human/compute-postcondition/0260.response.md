Postcondition: ***The program continues to execute if the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is not equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables maintain their initial values and properties, including `_` being either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `m` being at least 3, `t` being greater than `m - 1`, `a1` and `a2` being integers, `l1`, `l11`, `l22`, and `l` being lists of integers, `val` being a list containing `m - 1` tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` being an integer, `l3` being a list of integers, `n` being an integer that must be at least `m` or `m`, and `stdin` containing either no input or `m - 3` inputs: strings. Additionally, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` or `-1`, and `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, depending on the conditions specified in the precondition.
