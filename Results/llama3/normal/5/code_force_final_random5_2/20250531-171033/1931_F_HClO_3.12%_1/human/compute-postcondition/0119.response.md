The code `input()` accepts a line of input from the user, but since stdin is empty, it will wait for the user to enter a line of input. Once the user enters a line of input and presses enter, the input will be discarded because it is not assigned to any variable.

Output State: **_ is 0, t is greater than 0, n and m are integers and m is at least 3, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 and idx2 remain unchanged, l remains unchanged, and stdin is empty.**
