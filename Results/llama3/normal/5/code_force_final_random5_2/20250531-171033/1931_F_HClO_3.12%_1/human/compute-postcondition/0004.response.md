Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different), `_` is 0.**

The code `input()` accepts one line of input from stdin, which contains a test case. After executing this code, one test case is removed from stdin, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this code. The value of `m` is still 1. The relationship between `m` and `n` is still valid, and the product of `n` and `m` is still less than or equal to 2 * 10^5.
