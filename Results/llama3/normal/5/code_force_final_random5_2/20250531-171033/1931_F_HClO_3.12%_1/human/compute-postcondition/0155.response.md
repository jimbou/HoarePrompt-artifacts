Output State: **`idx1` is either `i` or remains unchanged, `p1` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `idx2` is either `i` or remains unchanged, `p2` is either 1 or remains unchanged, `_` is either 0 or `m - 2`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
