Functionality: **This function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints either 'yes' or 'no' to the standard output. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function iterates over a specified number of test cases, each consisting of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers. It checks if the input satisfies certain conditions and prints 'yes' if all conditions are met, otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function consumes all input from the standard input and leaves it empty after execution.**
