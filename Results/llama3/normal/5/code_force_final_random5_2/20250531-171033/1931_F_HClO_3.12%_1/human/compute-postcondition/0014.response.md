Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least 3, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` times `m` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t` - 4 test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. The current values of `l11` and `l22` are not equal, `_` is 1**

The code `input()` accepts a test case from the stdin, which contains `t` - 3 test cases initially. After executing the code, one test case is removed from the stdin, leaving `t` - 4 test cases. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
