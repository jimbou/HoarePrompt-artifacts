Output State: **_ is either 0 or m - 3, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, a3 is an integer, and l3 is a list of integers. If the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

Explanation:
The first line appends a tuple containing the values of `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`, which was initially empty. The second line decrements the value of `m` by 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
