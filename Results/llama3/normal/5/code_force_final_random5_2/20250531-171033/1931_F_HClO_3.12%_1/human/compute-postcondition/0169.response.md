Postcondition: ***If l1[i + p1] does not equal l2[i + p2], then idx1 is either i or remains unchanged, p1 is either 1 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is either 1 or remains unchanged. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is i, p1 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, then idx2 is either i or m - 1, p2 is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.***
