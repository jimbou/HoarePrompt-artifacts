Output State: **idx1 is i, idx2 is i, i is either 1 or m - 1, _*_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 3, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and l remains unchanged.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, effectively setting them equal to each other. The value of `i` is either 1 or `m - 1`, as specified in the initial state. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The conditions and relationships between the variables, such as the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, and `l`, remain the same as in the initial state.
