Postcondition: **`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers. If `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` and `l` is a reference to `l2`. All other variables maintain their initial state. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
