Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 4 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing an integer and a list of integers, where the last tuple contains a3 and l3, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, _ is 2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers**

The code reads an integer and a list of integers from stdin and appends them as a tuple to the list `val`. The integer `a3` and the list `l3` are assigned the values read from stdin. The value of `t` is not affected, but the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1. The other variables `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `_` remain unchanged.
