Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is at least i + 2, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 1 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is some value less than n - 1, idx1 is equal to i, p1 is equal to 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1` and the value of `1` to `p1`. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin also remains the same.
