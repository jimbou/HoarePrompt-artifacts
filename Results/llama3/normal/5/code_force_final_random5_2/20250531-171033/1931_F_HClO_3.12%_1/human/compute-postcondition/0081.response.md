Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is at least m, m is less than or equal to n, n times m is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, stdin contains t - m - 2 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers equal to l2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers. Either idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative or i equals n - 1. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, then idx1 equals idx2 if and only if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1. Otherwise, idx1 is the index of the first occurrence of a2 in l1 and idx2 is the index of the first occurrence of a1 in l2. If i equals n - 1, then either l1 does not contain a2 or l2 does not contain a1, or a2 is not equal to a1. Additionally, idx1 is not greater than idx2.**

The code inserts `a2` at index `idx1` in `l2`, making `l2` a new list with `a2` at the specified position. The variable `l` is then assigned the value of `l2`, which now includes `a2` at index `idx1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
