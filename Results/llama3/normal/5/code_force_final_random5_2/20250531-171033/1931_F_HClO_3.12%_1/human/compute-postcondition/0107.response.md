Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val` has at least one more pair of values, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l`, `a3` is the next value from `val`, `l3` is the next list of integers from `val`, and 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables retain their initial values, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l`, `a3`, and `l3` still hold their respective values, and the string 'no' has been printed. The program execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was directly inside.
