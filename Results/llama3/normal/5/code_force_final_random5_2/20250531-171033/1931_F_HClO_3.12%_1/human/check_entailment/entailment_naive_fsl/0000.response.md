Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when there are more than two screenshots and the order of participants is not consistent across all screenshots. 

In the given code, the program only checks the consistency of the order of participants between the first two screenshots and then uses this order to check the consistency with the remaining screenshots. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility that the order of participants may be different in the remaining screenshots.

For example, consider the case where there are three screenshots with the following orders of participants:

Screenshot 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Screenshot 2: [2, 3, 1, 4]
Screenshot 3: [3, 1, 2, 4]

In this case, the program will incorrectly conclude that the order of participants is consistent across all screenshots because it only checks the consistency between the first two screenshots and then uses this order to check the consistency with the third screenshot. However, the order of participants is not consistent across all three screenshots.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
