Output State: *_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is i, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and l remains unchanged. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 or l2[i + p2] does not equal a1, then if both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of idx1, idx2, p1, p2, and l remain unchanged.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The initial state of the variables _ (either 0 or m - 2), t (greater than 0), n (an integer that must be at least 2), m (an integer), a1 (an integer), a2 (an integer), l1 (a list of integers), l2 (a list of integers), l11 (a list of integers excluding a2), and l22 (a list of integers excluding a1) remains unchanged.
* If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is set to i, idx2 is set to i, p1 is set to 0, p2 is set to 0, and l remains unchanged.
* If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 or l2[i + p2] does not equal a1, then:
	+ If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
	+ Otherwise, the values of idx1, idx2, p1, p2, and l remain unchanged.

In summary, the loop iterates until it finds a match between l1[i + p1] and a2, and l2[i + p2] and a1, or until both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0. If a match is found, idx1 and idx2 are set to i, and p1 and p2 are set to 0. If no match is found, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of idx1, idx2, p1, p2, and l remain unchanged.
