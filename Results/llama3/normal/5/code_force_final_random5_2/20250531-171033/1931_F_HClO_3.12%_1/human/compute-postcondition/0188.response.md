Output State: **_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is an empty list, idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, and the index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3**

The code snippet inserts the value of `a2` at index `idx1` in the list `l2` and then assigns the modified list `l2` to the variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
