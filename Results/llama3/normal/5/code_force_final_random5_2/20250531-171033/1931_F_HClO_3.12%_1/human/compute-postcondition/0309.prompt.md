Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, and `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l2` is modified with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, and `l` is a reference to the modified `l2`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, then if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a reference to `l1`. Otherwise, `m` is one less than its original value, and if `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` and `l` is a reference to `l2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is either n - 1 or n - 2, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3), and m must be at least 3, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is either n - 1 or n - 2, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (a3, l3) and the second tuple contains an integer a3 and a list of integers l3, m is at least 4, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is either n - 1 or n - 2, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (a3, l3), the second tuple contains an integer a3 and a list of integers l3, and the third tuple contains an integer a3 and a list of integers l3, m is at least 5, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
