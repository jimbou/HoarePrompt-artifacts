The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 5.
State: **`i` is either n - 1 or n - 2, `idx1` is either i or -1, `idx2` is either i or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (a3, l3) and the second tuple contains an integer a3 and a list of integers l3, `m` is at least 5, `stdin` is empty**
