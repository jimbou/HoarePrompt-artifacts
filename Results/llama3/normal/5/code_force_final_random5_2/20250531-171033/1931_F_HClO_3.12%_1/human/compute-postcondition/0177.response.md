Output State: **_ is either 0 or m - 2, t is greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is greater than idx2, idx2 is either greater than or equal to 0 or remains unchanged, p1 is either 0 or remains unchanged, p2 is either 0 or remains unchanged, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, val is an empty list.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

* The first line inserts the value of `a1` at index `idx2` in the list `l1`. This changes the state of `l1` to include `a1` at the specified index.
* The second line assigns the modified list `l1` to the variable `l`. This changes the state of `l` to be the same as `l1`, which now includes `a1` at index `idx2`.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The final state includes all the valid information from the precondition, with the updated values of `l1` and `l` reflecting the changes made by the code.
