The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has finished executing, so `_` is equal to `t`. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be reset to 0 and `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged**
