Output State: **The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining the initial state of all variables except for i, idx1, idx2, p1, and p2, which are updated based on the conditions l1[i + p1] equals a2, l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, and l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2].**

In this output state, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of the variables are updated as follows:

- If the current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n - 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If l1[i + p1] equals a2, idx1 is i, p1 is 1, and all other variables maintain their initial state.
- If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, idx2 is i, p2 is 1, and all other variables maintain their initial state.
- If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, idx1 is i, idx2 is i, and all other variables maintain their initial state.
- Otherwise, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when idx1 is greater than or equal to 0 and idx2 is greater than or equal to 0, maintaining the initial state of all variables. Otherwise, it continues to execute, maintaining the initial state of all variables, and updates idx1 and idx2 based on the conditions l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l1[i + p2] equals a2, and updates p1 and p2 accordingly, if l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2].
