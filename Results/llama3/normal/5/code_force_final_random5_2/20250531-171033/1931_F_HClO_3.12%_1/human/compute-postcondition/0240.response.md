To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already stated to be at least 2, we can conclude that `n` is indeed at least 2. However, to make the loop execute, `i` needs to be initialized to 0.

State: **_ is either m - 1 or m - 2, m is at least 3, t is greater than m - 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, l is a list of integers, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer that must be at least 2, stdin contains either no input or m - 3 inputs: strings, i is 0**
