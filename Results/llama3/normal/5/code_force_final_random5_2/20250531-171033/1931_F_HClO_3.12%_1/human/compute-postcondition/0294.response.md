Output State: **`i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, and all other variables maintain their initial state. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is 2, 'yes' has been printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes have been made.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain the same as in the initial state. The code has introduced two new variables: `a3` and `l3`. `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l3` is assigned the rest of the integers from the input as a list. The stdin now contains no input. The relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` remains the same, and the condition regarding `m` also remains unchanged.
