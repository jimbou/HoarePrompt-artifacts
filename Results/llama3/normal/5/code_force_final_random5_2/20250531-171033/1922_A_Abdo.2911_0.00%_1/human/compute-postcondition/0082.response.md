To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since we are given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` to determine if the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we know that `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 1**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `i` and `n`, as they are the only variables involved in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
