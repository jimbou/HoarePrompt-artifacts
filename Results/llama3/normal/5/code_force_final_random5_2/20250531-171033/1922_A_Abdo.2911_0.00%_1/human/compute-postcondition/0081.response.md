Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` in uppercase.***
