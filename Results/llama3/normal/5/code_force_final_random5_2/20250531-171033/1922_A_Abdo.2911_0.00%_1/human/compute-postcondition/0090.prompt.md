Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, template is an empty list, stdin is empty, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, i is equal to n, match_a_b is False, match_c is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` in uppercase.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 1. If the character at index 1 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 1 of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index 1 of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the character at index 1 in string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the character at index 1 of string `a` if the character at index 1 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 1 of string `b`, otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the character at index 1 in string `a`. If the character at index 2 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 2 of string `b`, then `template` also contains the character at index 2 of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the character at index 2 in string `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
