The code `template.append(a[i].upper())` appends the uppercase version of the character at index `i` in string `a` to the list `template`. 

Since `i` is 1, the character at index 1 in string `a` is appended to `template`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 1, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the character at index 1 in string `a`.**
