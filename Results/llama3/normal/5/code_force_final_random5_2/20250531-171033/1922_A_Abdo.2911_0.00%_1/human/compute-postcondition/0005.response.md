The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. Since `i` is 0, the first character of string `a` is appended to `template`. The current value of `a` at index `i` is equal to the current value of `b` at index `i`, so the first character of string `a` is the same as the first character of string `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `template` is a list containing the first character of string `a` (which is the same as the first character of string `b`), `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0.**
