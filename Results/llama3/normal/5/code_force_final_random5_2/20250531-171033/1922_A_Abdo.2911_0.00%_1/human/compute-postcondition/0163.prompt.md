Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: match_a_b is either True or False, match_c is either True or False, template is an empty list, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, n is an integer, stdin contains no inputs, t is greater than 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `t` is greater than 1, and `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `template` contains the second character of string `a` if the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, otherwise `template` contains the uppercase version of the second character of string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, then `template` contains the second character of string `a` and the third character of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the second character of string `a` and the uppercase version of the third character of string `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
