Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is True, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` (ignoring case). Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `match_a_b` and `match_c` are either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` (ignoring case). If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is in lowercase, or if `c[i]` is the same as `template[i]` (ignoring case) when `template[i]` is in uppercase, then `match_c` is False. Otherwise, `match_c` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_a_b` and `match_c` are either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If `template[i]` is in lowercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is in uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` (ignoring case), and `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). Otherwise, the state of `match_c` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `match_a_b` and `match_c` are either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 2, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If `template[i]` is in lowercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is in uppercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). Otherwise, the state of `match_c` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
