Postcondition: ***The program has finished executing the if-else block. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are determined based on the values of `template[i]`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` for each iteration of the loop. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to `template[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to `template[i]` if the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). The value of `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise it is False. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False.***
