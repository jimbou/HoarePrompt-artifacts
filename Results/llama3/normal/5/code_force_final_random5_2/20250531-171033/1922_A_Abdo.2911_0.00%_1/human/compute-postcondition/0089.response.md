Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the character at index 1 of string `a` if the character at index 1 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 1 of string `b`, otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the character at index 1 in string `a`. If the character at index 2 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 2 of string `b`, then `template` also contains the character at index 2 of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the character at index 2 in string `a`.***
