Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase.**

In this output state, the value of `match_a_b` has been updated to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state's conditions that are still valid after the code has been executed are included in the output state.
