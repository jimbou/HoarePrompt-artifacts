Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase. If the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `template[i]` when both are converted to lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
