Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `i` is equal to 0, `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`.**

The code sets the value of `match_a_b` to True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
