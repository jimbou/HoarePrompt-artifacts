Output: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. The current value of `match_a_b` is True, indicating that for all characters in `template`, if the character is in lowercase, then `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`. The current value of `match_c` is False, indicating that there exists at least one character in `template` where `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is in lowercase, or `c[i]` is the same as `template[i]` (ignoring case) when `template[i]` is in uppercase. and 'YES' is printed**
