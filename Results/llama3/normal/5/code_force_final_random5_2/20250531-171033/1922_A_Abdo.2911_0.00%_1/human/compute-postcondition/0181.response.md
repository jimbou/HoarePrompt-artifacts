To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be `n + 1` and `n` to be greater than `n + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than `n + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase.**
