To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `template` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
