Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, and `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is True. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is False.***
