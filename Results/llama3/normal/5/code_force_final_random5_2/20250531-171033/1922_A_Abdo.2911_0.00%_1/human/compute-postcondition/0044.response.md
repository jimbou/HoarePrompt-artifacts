To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `n`, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be within the range of `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is within the range of `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase, `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is True**
