Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3.  It then constructs a template string by iterating over the characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it adds the character to the template in lowercase. If the characters are different, it adds the character from `a` in uppercase to the template.
4.  The program then checks if the strings `a` and `b` match the template. It does this by iterating over the characters of the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are not the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
5.  After checking if `a` and `b` match the template, the program checks if the string `c` does not match the template. It does this by iterating over the characters of the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in `c` is not the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in `c` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
6.  Finally, the program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Correctness: **True**
