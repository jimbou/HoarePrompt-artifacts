Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` (ignoring case) is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), and `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` if the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` (ignoring case) is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), and `match_c` is False if `c[i]` (ignoring case) is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_c` is True. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The loop iterates over the range of `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The integer `t` is greater than 1 and remains unchanged.
- The variable `_` is always 1.
- The variable `i` is equal to `n` after the loop finishes executing.
- The `template` list contains the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`.
- The conditions for `match_a_b` and `match_c` are the same as in the previous output states, with the addition that if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False, and if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False.
