Postcondition: ***`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. The character at index `i` in `template` is in uppercase. The current value of the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` (ignoring case).***
