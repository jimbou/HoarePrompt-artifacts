Postcondition: **`match_a_b` and `match_c` are either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` (ignoring case). If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is in lowercase, or if `c[i]` is the same as `template[i]` (ignoring case) when `template[i]` is in uppercase, then `match_c` is False. Otherwise, `match_c` remains True.**
