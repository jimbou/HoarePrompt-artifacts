Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.**
