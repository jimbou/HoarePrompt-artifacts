The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.**
