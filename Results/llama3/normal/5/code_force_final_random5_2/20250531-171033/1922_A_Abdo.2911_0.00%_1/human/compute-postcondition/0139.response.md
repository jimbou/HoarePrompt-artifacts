Output State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` (ignoring case) is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), and `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` if the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` (ignoring case) is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), and `match_c` is False if `c[i]` (ignoring case) is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_c` is True. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are determined based on the values of `template[i]`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` for each iteration of the loop. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to `template[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to `template[i]` if the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). The value of `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise it is False. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False.
