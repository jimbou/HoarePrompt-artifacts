Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `i` is equal to 0, `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, and `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase, then either the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case) or the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, and `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase, then either the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case) or the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_a_b` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, and `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` (ignoring case) is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
