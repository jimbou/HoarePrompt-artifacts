Postcondition: ***`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `t` is greater than 1, and `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string `a`***
