The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`match_a_b` and `match_c` are either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 2, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If `template[i]` is in lowercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is in uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` (ignoring case), and `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). Otherwise, the state of `match_c` remains unchanged.**
