Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 1. If the character at index 1 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 1 of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index 1 of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the character at index 1 in string `a`.***
