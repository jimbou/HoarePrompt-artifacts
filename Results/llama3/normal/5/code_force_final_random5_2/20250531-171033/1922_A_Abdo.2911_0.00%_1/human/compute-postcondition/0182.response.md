Output State: **match_a_b is False, match_c is either True or False, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, n is greater than n + 1, t is greater than 1, i is equal to n + 1, and template contains the characters of string a where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string b, otherwise it is in uppercase.**

The code snippet sets `match_a_b` to `False` and then encounters a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. Therefore, the only change is that `match_a_b` is now `False`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
