The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, and `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase, then either the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case) or the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_a_b` is False.**
