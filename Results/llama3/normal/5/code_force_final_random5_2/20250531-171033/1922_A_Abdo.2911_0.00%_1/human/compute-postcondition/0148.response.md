Output State: **match_a_b is either True or False, match_c is either True or False, template is an empty list, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, n is an integer, stdin contains no inputs, t is greater than 1**

The code snippet reads three lines of input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. It also reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The `template` variable is initialized as an empty list. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are not modified by the code, so they remain either True or False. The value of `t` is also not modified, so it remains greater than 1. Stdin is empty after the code execution because all inputs have been read.
