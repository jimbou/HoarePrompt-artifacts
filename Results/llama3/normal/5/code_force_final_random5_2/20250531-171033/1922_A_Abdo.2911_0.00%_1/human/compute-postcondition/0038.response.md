Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 2, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin is empty, i is 2, template is a list containing characters from string a where characters at indices where a and b have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where a and b have different characters are in uppercase, match_a_b is False.**

The code block sets the value of `match_a_b` to False and then breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is in. The break statement does not affect any variables, so the only change is that `match_a_b` is now False. All other variables remain unchanged.
