Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the output state is determined by the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` after the last iteration. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are determined based on the values of `template[i]`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the output state is determined by the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` after the last iteration. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are determined based on the values of `template[i]`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` for each iteration of the loop.
