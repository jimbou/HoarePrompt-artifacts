Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is less than `n`, `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase and `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` (ignoring case) is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), and `match_c` is True. If the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False.***
