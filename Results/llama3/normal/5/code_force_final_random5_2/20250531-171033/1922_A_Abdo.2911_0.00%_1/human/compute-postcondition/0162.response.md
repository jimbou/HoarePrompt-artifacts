Postcondition: ***`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, then `template` contains the second character of string `a` and the third character of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the second character of string `a` and the uppercase version of the third character of string `a`.***
