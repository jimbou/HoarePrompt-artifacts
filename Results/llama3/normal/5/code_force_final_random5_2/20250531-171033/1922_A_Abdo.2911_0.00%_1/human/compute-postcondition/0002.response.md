Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, template is an empty list, stdin is empty**

The code snippet reads three lines of input from stdin and assigns them to variables a, b, and c. The first line of input is converted to an integer and assigned to n. The template variable is initialized as an empty list. The value of t and _ remains unchanged. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
