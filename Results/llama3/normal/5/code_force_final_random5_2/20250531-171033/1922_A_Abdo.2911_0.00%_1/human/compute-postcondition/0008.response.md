Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is the same as the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the first character of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing one element which is the uppercase version of the character at index `i` of string `a`.***
