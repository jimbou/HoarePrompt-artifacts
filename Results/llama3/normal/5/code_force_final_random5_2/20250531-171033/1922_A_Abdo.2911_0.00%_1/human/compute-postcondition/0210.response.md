Postcondition: **`match_a_b` and `match_c` are either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 2, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), then `match_c` is False. Otherwise, the state of `match_c` remains unchanged.**
