Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `t`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The `template` list will contain the characters of string `a`, where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, and in uppercase otherwise.
