The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the character at index 1 of string `a` if the character at index 1 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 1 of string `b`, otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the character at index 1 in string `a`.**
