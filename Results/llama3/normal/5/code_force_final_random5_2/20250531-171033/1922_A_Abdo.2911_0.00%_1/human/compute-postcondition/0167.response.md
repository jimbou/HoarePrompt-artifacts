Postcondition: ***`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. The current value of `template[i]` is in lowercase. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.***
