The code appends the uppercase version of the character at index `i` in string `a` to the `template` list. Since `i` is 2, the character at index 2 in string `a` is appended to the `template` list. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the character at index 1 of string `a` if the character at index 1 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 1 of string `b`, otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the character at index 1 in string `a`, and the uppercase version of the character at index 2 in string `a`.**
