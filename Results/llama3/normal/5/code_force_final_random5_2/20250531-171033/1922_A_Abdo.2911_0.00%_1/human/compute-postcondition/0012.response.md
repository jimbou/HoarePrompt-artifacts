Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, `template` is a list containing the second character of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the second character of string `a`.***
