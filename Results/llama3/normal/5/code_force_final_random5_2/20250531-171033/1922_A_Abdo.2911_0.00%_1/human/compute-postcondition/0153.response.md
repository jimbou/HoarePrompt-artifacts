Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string `a`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `t` is greater than 1, and `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `template` list now contains the uppercase of the first character of string `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
