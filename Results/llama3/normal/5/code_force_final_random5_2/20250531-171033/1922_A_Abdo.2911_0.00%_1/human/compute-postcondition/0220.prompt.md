Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
            ].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The program has finished executing the if-else block. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are determined based on the values of `template[i]`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` for each iteration of the loop. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to `template[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to `template[i]` if the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). The value of `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise it is False. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`match_a_b` and `match_c` are either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
