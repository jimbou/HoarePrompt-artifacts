Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is True, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. The current value of the character at index `i` in `template` is in lowercase. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. The current value of `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.**
