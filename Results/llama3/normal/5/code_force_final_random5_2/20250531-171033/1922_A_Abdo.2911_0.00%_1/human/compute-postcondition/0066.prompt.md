Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase, `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is within the range of `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase, `match_a_b` is either True or False. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` when both are converted to lowercase, otherwise no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i` + 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is within the range of `n` + 1, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase, `match_a_b` is either True or False. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` when both are converted to lowercase, otherwise no changes are made to `match_c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i` + 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is within the range of `n` + 2, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase, `match_a_b` is either True or False. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` when both are converted to lowercase, otherwise no changes are made to `match_c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
