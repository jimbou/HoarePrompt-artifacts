Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. The current value of `match_a_b` is True and the current value of `match_c` is False. The value of `match_a_b` is True if and only if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to `template[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is True if and only if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). The value of `match_c` is False because `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`.**
