The code appends the uppercase version of the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. The index `i` is 1, so the second character of string `a` is appended to `template`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `template` contains the uppercase version of the second character of string `a`.**
