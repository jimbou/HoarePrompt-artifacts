Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is True, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is in uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` (ignoring case). Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True.**

In this output state, the value of `match_c` has been updated to True, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions that determine the value of `match_a_b` also remain the same.
