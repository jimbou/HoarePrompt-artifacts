The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range of `n` + 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i` + 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i` + 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i` + 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is within the range of `n` + 2, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase, `match_a_b` is either True or False. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` when both are converted to lowercase, otherwise no changes are made to `match_c`.**
