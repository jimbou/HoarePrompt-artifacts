Postcondition: ***`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is either True or False, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `n` is greater than `n + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `template` contains the characters of string `a` where each character is in lowercase if it matches the corresponding character in string `b`, otherwise it is in uppercase. If the lowercase version of the character at index `i` in string `a` is equal to the lowercase version of the character at index `i` in `template`, or the lowercase version of the character at index `i` in string `b` is equal to the lowercase version of the character at index `i` in `template`, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
