Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 1, and `template` is a list containing the characters of string `a` if the characters at the corresponding indices of string `a` and string `b` are equal, otherwise the uppercase version of the characters at the corresponding indices in string `a`. The current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
