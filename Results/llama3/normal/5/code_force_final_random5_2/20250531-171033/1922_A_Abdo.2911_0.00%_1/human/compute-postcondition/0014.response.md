The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. Since `i` is 2, the character at index 2 of string `a` is appended to `template`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the character at index 2 of string `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, the value of `_` is still 0, the value of `n` is still greater than 2, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still strings, the stdin is still empty, the value of `i` is still 2, and the list `template` now contains the character at index 2 of string `a`.
