Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i` + 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is within the range of `n` + 1, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` where characters at indices where `a` and `b` have the same character are in lowercase, and characters at indices where `a` and `b` have different characters are in uppercase, `match_a_b` is either True or False. If `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` when both are converted to lowercase, then `match_c` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to `match_c`.***
