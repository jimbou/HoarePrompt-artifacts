Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, row1 is the second element of the third test case, row2 is the third element of the third test case, reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test_case`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged from their initial state. However, the variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, `reachable_first_row` is now `False`, indicating that the first row is no longer reachable, and `reachable_second_row` is `True`, indicating that the second row is reachable.
