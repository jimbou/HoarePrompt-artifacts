Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the robot can reach the last column from the first row or the second row, but it does not consider the possibility of the robot moving up or down and then moving along the arrow.

A counterexample is when the input is:

4
><<
>><

In this case, the program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because the robot can move down from (1, 1) to (2, 1), then move along the arrow to (2, 2), and finally move along the arrow to (2, 4).

The program does not handle this case correctly because it only checks if the robot can reach the last column from the first row or the second row, but it does not consider the possibility of the robot moving up or down and then moving along the arrow.
