Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' and the last element is 'NO', `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is False**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `results` now has an additional element 'NO' appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
