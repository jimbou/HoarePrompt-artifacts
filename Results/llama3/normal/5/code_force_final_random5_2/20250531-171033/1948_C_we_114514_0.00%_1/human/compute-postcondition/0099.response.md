Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, reachable_first_row is False, and reachable_second_row is True.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test_case`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged. However, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, `reachable_first_row` is set to `False` and `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.
