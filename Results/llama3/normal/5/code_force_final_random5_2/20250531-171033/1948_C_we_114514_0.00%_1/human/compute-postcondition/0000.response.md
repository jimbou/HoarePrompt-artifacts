Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and `n` is even, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `results` and assigned it an empty list.
