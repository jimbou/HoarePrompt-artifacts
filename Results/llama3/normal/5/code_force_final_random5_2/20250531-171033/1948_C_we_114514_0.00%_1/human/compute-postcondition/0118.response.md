Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the third test case in the list, n is at least 1, row1 is the second element of the third test case, row2 is the third element of the third test case. If the current value of row1 at index j is '>', then reachable_second_row is True if j is equal to n - 1, otherwise reachable_second_row is False, and j is equal to n - 1. Otherwise, reachable_first_row is False, and if j is less than n-1 and the current value of row2[j] is '>', then reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, reachable_second_row remains False.***
