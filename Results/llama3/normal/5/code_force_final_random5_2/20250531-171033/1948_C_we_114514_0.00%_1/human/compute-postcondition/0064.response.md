Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0. The current value of `j` is less than `n` minus 1, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The program still has a positive integer `t`, a list of test cases with at least two test cases, a list of results containing either 'YES' or 'NO', and the current test case is still the second one. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are also unchanged. The value of `j` is still 0, which is less than `n` minus 1, and the current value of `row2[j]` is still '>'.
