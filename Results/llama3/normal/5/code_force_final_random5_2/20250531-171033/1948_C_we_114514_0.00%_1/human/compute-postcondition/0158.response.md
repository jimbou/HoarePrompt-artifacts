Output State: **The program returns a list of strings containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in the initial test_cases list. The last element of the list is 'YES' if reachable_second_row is True, otherwise it is 'NO'.**

In this output state, the list of strings represents the results of each test case. The last element of the list corresponds to the last test case, which has n as its first element, row1 as its second element, and row2 as its third element. The value of the last element is determined by the value of reachable_second_row: if it is True, the last element is 'YES', indicating that the second row is reachable; otherwise, it is 'NO', indicating that the second row is not reachable.
