Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 1, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases, the values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `j`, and the boolean value of `reachable_first_row` are still the same as in the initial state.
