    #State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is an empty list, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in the initial test_cases list, test_case is the last test case in the initial test_cases list, n is the first element of the last test case, row1 is the second element of the last test case, row2 is the third element of the last test case, reachable_first_row is False, and reachable_second_row is either True or False. If reachable_second_row is True, the last element of results is 'YES'. Otherwise, the last element of results is 'NO'
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in the initial test_cases list. The last element of the list is 'YES' if reachable_second_row is True, otherwise it is 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and two strings of length n, containing '<' and '>' characters. It determines whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string from the first string, following the directions indicated by the '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string for each test case.
