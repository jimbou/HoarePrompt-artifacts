Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer. The list of test cases `test_cases` remains unchanged. The list of results `results` now contains the string 'NO', indicating that the current test case has failed. The current test case `test_case` and its elements `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain the same. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are still False, indicating that the first and second rows are not reachable.
