Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, row1 is the second element of the third test case, row2 is the third element of the third test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row`. The first line unpacks the values from `test_case` into `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, updating their values. The second line sets `reachable_first_row` to `True`. The third line sets `reachable_second_row` to `False`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.
