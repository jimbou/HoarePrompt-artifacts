The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `j`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `j` can be at most `n-1` at the end of the last iteration. So for the loop to execute again `j` must be `n-1` + 1 and `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 1**
