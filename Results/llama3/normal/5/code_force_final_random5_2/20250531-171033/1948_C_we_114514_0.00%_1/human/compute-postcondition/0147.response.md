Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 2, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` is set to True, regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
