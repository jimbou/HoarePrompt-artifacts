Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, reachable_first_row is True, and reachable_second_row is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 0, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case. If reachable_second_row is True, then if row2[j] is '>', reachable_first_row is True if j is equal to n-1, otherwise reachable_first_row is False. If row2[j] is not '>', then reachable_first_row is False. If reachable_second_row is False, then the state of reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 1, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, j is 1. If reachable_second_row is True, then if row2[j] is '>', reachable_second_row is True if j is equal to n - 1, otherwise no changes are made to reachable_second_row, and reachable_first_row remains unchanged. If reachable_second_row is False, then no changes are made to reachable_second_row and reachable_first_row.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 2, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, j is 2. If reachable_second_row is True, then if j is equal to n - 1, reachable_second_row is True. If j is less than n - 1 and row2[j] is '>', then reachable_second_row is True and reachable_first_row is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
