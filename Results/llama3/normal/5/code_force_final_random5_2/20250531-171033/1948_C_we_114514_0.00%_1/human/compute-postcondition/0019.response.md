Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is True, and j is equal to n minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, as the given code only assigns a value to `reachable_second_row` that is already True. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values and conditions.
