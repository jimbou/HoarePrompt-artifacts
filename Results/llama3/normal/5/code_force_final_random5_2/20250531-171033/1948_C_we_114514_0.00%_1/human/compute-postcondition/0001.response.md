To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `test_case` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list**
