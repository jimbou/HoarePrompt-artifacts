Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' and the last element is 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer. The `test_cases` list still contains at least 3 test cases. The `results` list now has an additional element 'NO' appended to it. The values of `test_case`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.
