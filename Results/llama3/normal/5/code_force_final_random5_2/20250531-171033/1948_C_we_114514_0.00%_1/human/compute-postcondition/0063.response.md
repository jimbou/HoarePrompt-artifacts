Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is 0. The current value of `j` is less than `n` minus 1, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'***
