The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is at least 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 2**
