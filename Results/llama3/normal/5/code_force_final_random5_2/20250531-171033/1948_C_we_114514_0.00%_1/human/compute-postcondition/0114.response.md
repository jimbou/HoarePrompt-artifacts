Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is 0, and the element at index `j` of `row1` is not '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_first_row` has been changed to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, results, and the current test case are still the same. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are also unchanged. The value of `j` is still 0, and the element at index `j` of `row1` is still not '>'. The value of `reachable_second_row` is still False.
