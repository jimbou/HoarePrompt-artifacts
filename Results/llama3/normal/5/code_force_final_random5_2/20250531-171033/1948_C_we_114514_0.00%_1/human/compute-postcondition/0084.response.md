Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 1, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, j is 1. If j is equal to n - 1, then reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to reachable_second_row. reachable_first_row remains unchanged.***
