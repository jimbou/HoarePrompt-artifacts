Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 2. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
