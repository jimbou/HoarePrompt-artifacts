Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 1, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is True or False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` is set to True, regardless of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are no longer applicable, as `reachable_second_row` is now always True.
