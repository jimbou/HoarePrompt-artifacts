According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, but we know that `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`. Since `j` is not specified, let's assume it is some value `x`. Then, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be `x+1` and `n` must be greater than `x+1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 1**
