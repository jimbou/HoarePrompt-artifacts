Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and two strings of length n, containing '<' and '>' characters. The function iterates over each test case and uses two boolean variables, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first and second rows, respectively.

The program correctly initializes `reachable_first_row` to True and `reachable_second_row` to False for each test case. It then iterates over each character in the first and second rows, updating the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` based on the direction of the arrow in the current cell.

If the robot can reach the end of the second row, the program appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns the list of results.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where n is even and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Correctness: **True**
