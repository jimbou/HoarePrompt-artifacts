Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, test_case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` remains True and `reachable_first_row` is True if `j` is equal to `n` minus 1, otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False. If `row2[j]` is not '>', then the values of `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then the values of `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `row2[j]` is '>', then if `j` is equal to `n-1`, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are True. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `row2[j]` is not '>', then no changes are made. If `reachable_second_row` is False, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 2. If `j` equals `n-1` or `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
