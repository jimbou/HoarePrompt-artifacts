Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 2, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been set to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases, the current test case, the results list, the values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `j`, and the value of `reachable_first_row` are all the same as before.
