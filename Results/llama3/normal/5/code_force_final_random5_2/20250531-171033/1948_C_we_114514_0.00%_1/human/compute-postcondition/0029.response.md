Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 1. If `j` is equal to `n-1`, then `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is True if `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False. ***
