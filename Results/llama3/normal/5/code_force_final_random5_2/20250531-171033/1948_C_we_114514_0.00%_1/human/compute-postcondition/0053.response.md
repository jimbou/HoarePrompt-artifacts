To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for test_case in test_cases:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `test_case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_cases` list. If `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, and `test_case` is the first test case in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases, and `test_case` must be the second test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is either True or False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.**
