Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, j is equal to n minus 1, and the current value of `reachable_first_row` is True. Additionally, the current value of `row1[j]` is '>'**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that `reachable_second_row` is now True. All other variables and conditions remain the same. The value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
