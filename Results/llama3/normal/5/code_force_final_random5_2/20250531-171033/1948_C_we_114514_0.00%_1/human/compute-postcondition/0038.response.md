Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 2, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_first_row` has been updated to False, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `test_cases` still contains at least one test case, and `results` remains an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `j` are still the same as in the initial state.
