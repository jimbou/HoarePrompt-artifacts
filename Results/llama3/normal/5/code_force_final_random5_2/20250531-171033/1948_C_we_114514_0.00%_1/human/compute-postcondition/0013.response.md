Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` is False, j is 0, the element at index j of `row1` is not '>', and the current value of j is less than n-1 if `reachable_second_row` is True***
