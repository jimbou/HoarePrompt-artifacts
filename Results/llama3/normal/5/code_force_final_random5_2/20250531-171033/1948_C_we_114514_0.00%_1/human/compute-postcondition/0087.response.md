The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 2, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, j is 2**
