Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 2, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` is now set to True, regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer, `test_cases` having at least one test case, `results` being empty, `test_case` being the first test case, `n` being greater than `n-1` + 2, `row1` and `row2` being the second and third elements of the first test case, and `j` being `n-1` + 2.
