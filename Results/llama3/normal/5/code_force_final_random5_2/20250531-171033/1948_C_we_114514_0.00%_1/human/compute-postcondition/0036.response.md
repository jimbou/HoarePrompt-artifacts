Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 2, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `reachable_second_row` and assigned it the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 2 is still valid, and the relationships between the variables `row1`, `row2`, and `j` are preserved.
