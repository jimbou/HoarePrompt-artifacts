Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 0, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case. If the first character of row1 at index j is '>', then reachable_first_row is True and reachable_second_row is True if j is equal to n-1, otherwise reachable_second_row is False, and j is either equal to n-1 or is less than n-1. If the first character of row1 at index j is not '>', then reachable_first_row is False, and if j is less than n minus 1 and the current value of row2[j] is '>', then reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, reachable_second_row remains False.***
