Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 1, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, j is 1. If reachable_second_row is True, then if row2[j] is '>', reachable_second_row is True if j is equal to n - 1, otherwise no changes are made to reachable_second_row, and reachable_first_row remains unchanged. If reachable_second_row is False, then no changes are made to reachable_second_row and reachable_first_row.***
