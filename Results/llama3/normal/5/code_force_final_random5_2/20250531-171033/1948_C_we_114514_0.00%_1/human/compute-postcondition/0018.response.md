Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. The current value of `reachable_second_row` is True. If `row1[j]` is '>', then `reachable_first_row` is True, and j is equal to n minus 1. If `row1[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False, and j is 0, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', and j is less than n minus 1. Additionally, the current value of j is equal to n minus 1.**
