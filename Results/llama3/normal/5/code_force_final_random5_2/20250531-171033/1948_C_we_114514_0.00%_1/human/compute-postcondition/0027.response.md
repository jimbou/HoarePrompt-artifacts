Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 1, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The test case list, results list, and other variables related to the test case remain the same. The value of `j` is still `n-1` + 1, and `reachable_first_row` is still False.
