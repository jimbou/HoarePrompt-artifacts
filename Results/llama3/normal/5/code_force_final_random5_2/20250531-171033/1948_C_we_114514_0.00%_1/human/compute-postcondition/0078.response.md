Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 1, `reachable_second_row` is True or False, `reachable_first_row` is False**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `reachable_first_row`, which is now set to False. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer, `test_cases` having at least 2 test cases, `results` containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` being the second test case, `n` being greater than 1, `row1` and `row2` being the second and third elements of the second test case respectively, `j` being 1, and `reachable_second_row` being either True or False.
