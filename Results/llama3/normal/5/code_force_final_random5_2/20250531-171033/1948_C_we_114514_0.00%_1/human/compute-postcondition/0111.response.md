Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the third test case in the list, n is at least 1, row1 is the second element of the third test case, row2 is the third element of the third test case, reachable_first_row was True, reachable_second_row is True, and j is equal to n - 1. The current value of row1 at index j is '>', and the current value of j is equal to n - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of reachable_second_row has been updated to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The test_cases list still contains at least 3 test cases, and the results list still contains either 'YES' or 'NO'. The current test case is still the third one in the list, and the values of n, row1, and row2 are still the same. The value of j is still equal to n - 1, and the current value of row1 at index j is still '>'.
