Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, j is 0, the element at index j of `row1` is not '>', the current value of j is less than n-1, and the element at index j of `row2` is '>'**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The rest of the conditions and values of the variables are still valid as they were in the initial state.
