Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` remains True and `reachable_first_row` is True if `j` is equal to `n` minus 1, otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False. If `row2[j]` is not '>', then the values of `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then the values of `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain unchanged.***
