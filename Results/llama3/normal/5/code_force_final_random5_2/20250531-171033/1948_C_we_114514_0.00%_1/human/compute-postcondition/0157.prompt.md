Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and `n` is even, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test_case in test_cases:
    n, (row1, row2) = test_case
    reachable_first_row = True
    reachable_second_row = False
    for j in range(n):
        if reachable_first_row:
            if row1[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
            else:
                reachable_first_row = False
                if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            if row2[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, reachable_first_row is False, and reachable_second_row is either True or False. If reachable_second_row is True, results contains 'YES'. Otherwise, results contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. test_case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, reachable_first_row is False. If reachable_second_row is True, results has one more 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, the last element of results is 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. test_case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, row1 is the second element of the third test case, row2 is the third element of the third test case, reachable_first_row is False. If reachable_second_row is True, results has an extra 'YES' at the end. Otherwise, results has an extra 'NO' at the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
