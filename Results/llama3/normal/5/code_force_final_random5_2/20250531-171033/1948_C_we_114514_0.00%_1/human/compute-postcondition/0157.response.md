Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is an empty list, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in the initial test_cases list, test_case is the last test case in the initial test_cases list, n is the first element of the last test case, row1 is the second element of the last test case, row2 is the third element of the last test case, reachable_first_row is False, and reachable_second_row is either True or False. If reachable_second_row is True, the last element of results is 'YES'. Otherwise, the last element of results is 'NO'**.

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t remains unchanged as a positive integer. The test_cases list is now empty because all test cases have been processed. The results list contains the outcome of each test case, either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the second row was reachable in each test case. The test_case variable holds the last test case that was processed, with n, row1, and row2 being the corresponding elements of this last test case. The reachable_first_row variable is always False after the loop finishes, and reachable_second_row is either True or False, depending on the last test case's outcome.
