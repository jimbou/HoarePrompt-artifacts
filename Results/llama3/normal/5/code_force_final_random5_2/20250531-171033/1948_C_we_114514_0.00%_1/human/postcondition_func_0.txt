This function evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and two strings of length n, containing '<' and '>' characters. It determines whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string from the first string, following the directions indicated by the '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string for each test case.
