Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, test_case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `test_case` is still the first test case in the list, but its components are now unpacked into separate variables: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are assigned new values, with `reachable_first_row` being `True` and `reachable_second_row` being `False`.
