Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, test_case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test_case`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged. The value of `reachable_first_row` is set to False, indicating that the first row is not reachable after the loop has finished executing. The value of `reachable_second_row` is set to True, indicating that the second row is reachable after the loop has finished executing.
