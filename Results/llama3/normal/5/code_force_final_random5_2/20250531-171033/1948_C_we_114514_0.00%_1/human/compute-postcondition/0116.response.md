Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0, the element at index `j` of `row1` is not '>', the current value of `j` is less than `n-1`, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `j`, `row1[j]`, and `row2[j]` are still valid, and the rest of the variables maintain their initial properties.
