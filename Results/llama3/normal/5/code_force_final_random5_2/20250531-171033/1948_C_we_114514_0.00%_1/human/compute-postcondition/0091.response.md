Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 2, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 2, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The program has simply assigned the value True to the variable `reachable_second_row`, without affecting any other variables or conditions.
