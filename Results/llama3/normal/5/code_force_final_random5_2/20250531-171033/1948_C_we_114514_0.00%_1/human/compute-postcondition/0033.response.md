Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 1. If `row2[j]` is '>', then if `j` is equal to `n-1`, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are True. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `row2[j]` is not '>', then no changes are made.***
