Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 1, `reachable_first_row` is False**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, with the addition of `reachable_first_row` being set to False. The list of test cases, results, and the specific test case, as well as the values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `j`, remain unchanged.
