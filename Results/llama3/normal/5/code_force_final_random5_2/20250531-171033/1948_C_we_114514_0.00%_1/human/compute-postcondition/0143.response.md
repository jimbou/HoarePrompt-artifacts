Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 2, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The precondition information that is still valid after the code has been executed is included, with the updated value of `reachable_second_row`.
