Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 0, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is True, j is equal to n-1. The current value of reachable_first_row is True. Additionally, the first character of row1 at index j is '>'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to `True`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The test cases, results, and other variables retain their initial values. The first character of `row1` at index `j` is still '>', and `reachable_first_row` remains `True`.
