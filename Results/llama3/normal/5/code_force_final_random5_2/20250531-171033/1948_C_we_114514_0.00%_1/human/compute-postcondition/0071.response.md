Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 0, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, reachable_second_row is True, reachable_first_row is True, and j is equal to n-1.**

In this output state, the value of reachable_second_row is updated to True, and the other variables remain unchanged. The value of reachable_first_row is still True because the first character of row1 at index j is '>', and j is equal to n-1. The value of j is still equal to n-1.
