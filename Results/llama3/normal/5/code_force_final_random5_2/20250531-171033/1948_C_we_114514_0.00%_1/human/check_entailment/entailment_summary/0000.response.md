Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program uses a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input. Each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n`, containing '<' and '>' characters.

The function iterates over each test case and initializes two flags: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`. It then iterates over each character in the strings `row1` and `row2`. If the current character in `row1` is '>', it checks if the current position is at the end of the string. If it is, it sets `reachable_second_row` to True. If the current character in `row1` is '<', it sets `reachable_first_row` to False and checks if the current position is not at the end of the string and the character in `row2` is '>'. If both conditions are true, it sets `reachable_second_row` to True.

After iterating over all characters in the strings, the function checks if `reachable_second_row` is True. If it is, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

The program then prints the results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
