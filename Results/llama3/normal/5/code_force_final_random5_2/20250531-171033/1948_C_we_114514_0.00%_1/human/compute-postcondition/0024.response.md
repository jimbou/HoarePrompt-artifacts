Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than `n-1` + 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is `n-1` + 1, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `reachable_second_row` which is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
