Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 0, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case. The current value of reachable_second_row is True. If the first character of row1 at index j is '>', then reachable_first_row is True and j is equal to n-1. If the first character of row1 at index j is not '>', then reachable_first_row is False, and if j is less than n minus 1 and the current value of row2[j] is '>', then j is less than n-1.**
