Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, row1 is the second element of the third test case, row2 is the third element of the third test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the third test case in the list, n is at least 1, row1 is the second element of the third test case, row2 is the third element of the third test case. The value of reachable_second_row is True if reachable_second_row was True before the if statement, otherwise no changes are made to reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_first_row` is True if `j` equals `n - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is at least 2, `reachable_first_row` is True. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to `reachable_second_row`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
