To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `n` is not guaranteed to be greater than 0, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Additionally, `j` is the loop variable and should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the second test case in the list, n must be greater than 0, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, j is 0**
