Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. If `row1[j]` is '>', then `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True if j is equal to n minus 1, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is False, and j is either equal to n minus 1 or 0. If `row1[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True if j < n - 1 and `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` is False, and j is 0.***
