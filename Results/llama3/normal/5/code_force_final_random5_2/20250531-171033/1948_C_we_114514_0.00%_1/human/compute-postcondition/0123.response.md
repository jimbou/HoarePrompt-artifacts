Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', test_case is the third test case in the list, n is at least 1, row1 is the second element of the third test case, row2 is the third element of the third test case, reachable_second_row is True, row2[j] is '>', and j is equal to n - 1.**

The code simply assigns the value True to the variable reachable_second_row, which does not change any other variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that reachable_second_row is now explicitly stated as True.
