Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the current loop or if statement.
