Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `2 * n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` as in the initial state. However, the list `r` will have its values at indices `a_i - 1` incremented by 1 for all `i` in the range from `n` to `2 * n`. The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n`, and `stdin` will contain `n` fewer inputs.
