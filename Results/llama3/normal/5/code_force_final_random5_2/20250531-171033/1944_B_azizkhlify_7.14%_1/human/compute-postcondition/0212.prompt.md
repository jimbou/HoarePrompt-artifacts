Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 0 or `min(k, n)`, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and must have at least `n` elements, `i` is the last element in the list `res`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` equals `k`, then `k` is 0, `re` is `min(k, n)`, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed followed by a space. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 0 or `min(k, n)`, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 2 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and must have at least `n` elements, `i` is `n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 0 or `min(k, n)`, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 4 or 2 * min(k, n) + 2, `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and must have at least `n` elements, `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `a[n + 1]` (which is out of range) is printed twice, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 0 or `min(k, n)`, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 6 or 2 * min(k, n) + 4, `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and must have at least `n` elements, `i` is `n + 2`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the value of `a[i]` which is `a[n+2]` is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
