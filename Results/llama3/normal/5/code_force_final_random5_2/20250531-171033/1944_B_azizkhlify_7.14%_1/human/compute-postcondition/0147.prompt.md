Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `2 * n`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `2 * n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 otherwise it is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 0, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[i]` which is `a[0]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2 otherwise it is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[1]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and this is printed: the value of `a[1]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, the program continues executing the next statements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 6 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2 otherwise it is 4, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 2, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 2. If `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[1]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and this is printed: the value of `a[1]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, the program continues executing the next statements, and the value of `a[2]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the value of `a[2]` is printed twice with a space in between.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
