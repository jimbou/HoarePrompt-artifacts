Output State: **n is a positive integer that is at least 1, k is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - 2 * min(k, n), a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is i + 1 for all i from 0 to n - 1, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i from n to 2 * n - 1, re is either 1 or 2, ul is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, ur is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), res is a list containing the value of a[i] where l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and the value of a[i] where l[a[i] - 1] is 2 is printed twice with a space in between, i is either 1 or min(k, n), nothing is printed, and all elements in the list res are printed, n is at least 1.**

In this output state, the value of `re` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `a[i]` has been appended to the list `res`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the lists `a`, `l`, and `r` also remain unchanged. The values of `k`, `ul`, and `ur` are still either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - 2 * min(k, n), either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, and either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), respectively. The list `res` now contains the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 is printed twice with a space in between.
