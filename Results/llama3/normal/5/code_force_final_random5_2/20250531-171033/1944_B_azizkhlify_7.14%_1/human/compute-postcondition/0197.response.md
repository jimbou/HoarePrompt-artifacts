Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 0 or `min(k, n)`, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 2 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and must have at least `n` elements, `i` is `n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
