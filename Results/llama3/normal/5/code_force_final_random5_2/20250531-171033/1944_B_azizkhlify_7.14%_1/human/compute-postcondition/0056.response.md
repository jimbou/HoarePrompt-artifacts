Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is the number of times a_i appears in a for all i in range(n), `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is increased by 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n), `ul` is equal to k * 2 or n times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the element at index i in list a if the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l has a count of 1, otherwise res is a list containing the element at index i in list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l has a count of 1, then re is 2, otherwise re is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus n inputs. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
