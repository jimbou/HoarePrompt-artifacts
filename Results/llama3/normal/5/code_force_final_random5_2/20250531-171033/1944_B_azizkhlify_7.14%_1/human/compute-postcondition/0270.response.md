Output: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, re is either 0 or 1, ul is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, ur is 0, res is either an empty list or a list containing the value of a[i], i is 1, and if the current value of l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then the value of a[i] has been printed. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of a[i] which is a[i] is printed**
