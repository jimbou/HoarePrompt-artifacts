Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `l` will have the count of each integer from the input list `a` at the corresponding index. For example, if the input list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`, the list `l` will be `[2, 2, 2]` because the integer 1 appears twice, the integer 2 appears twice, and the integer 3 appears twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
