The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least `n + 1 - n` which is 1.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 1`, and nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
