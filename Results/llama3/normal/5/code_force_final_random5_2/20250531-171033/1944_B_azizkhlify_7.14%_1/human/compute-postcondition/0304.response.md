Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, `ul` is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `res` is a list containing all values of a[i], and all elements in the list `res` have been printed, `i` is n. The current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur`. If the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the current value of `ur` is 2 and the value of a[i] is printed twice. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
