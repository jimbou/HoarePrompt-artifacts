Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_n` is increased by 1 and the value at index `a_{n+2}` is increased by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` at index `a_{n+2} - 1` is increased by 1 because `i` is `n + 2` and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs because we have already read `n + 2` inputs.
