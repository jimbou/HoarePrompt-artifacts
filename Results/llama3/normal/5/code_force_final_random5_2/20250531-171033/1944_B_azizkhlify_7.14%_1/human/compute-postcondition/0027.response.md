Output: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 1. If the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a` is 2, then `ul` is 2 and `ur` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` and `ur`. If `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and this is printed: a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the ith element of the list a)**
