Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, re is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, ul is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, ur is 0, res is either an empty list or a list containing the values of a[i], i is n - 1. If k is not equal to 0, then l[a[i] - 1] is equal to 1, the value of a[i] has been printed and res is a list containing the values of a[i]. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. A blank line is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, `ul` is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the values of a[i], `i` is n - 1, and the value of `i` which is n - 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, `ul` is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing at least 2 values of a[i], and the second element in the list `res` which is `i` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, `ul` is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing at least 3 values of a[i], and the third element in the list `res` which is `j` is printed, `i` is `j`, and this is printed: `i` (which is equal to `j` which is the third element in the list `res` which is one of the values of `a[i]`)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
