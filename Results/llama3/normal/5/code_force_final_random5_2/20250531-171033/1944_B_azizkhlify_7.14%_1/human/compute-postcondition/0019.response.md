Output: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 0. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, indicating that the element `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`, and the following is printed: the value of `a[i]` which is an integer, and the value of `a[i]` which is an integer, both separated by a space**
