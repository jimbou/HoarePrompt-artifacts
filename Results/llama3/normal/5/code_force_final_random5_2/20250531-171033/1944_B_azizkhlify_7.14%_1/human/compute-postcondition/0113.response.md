Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[0] - 1]` is 2 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for `i` = 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed.**

In this output state, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `l[a[0] - 1]` is still 2, and the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is now 1 for `i` = 1. The other elements of the list `l` are still 0.
