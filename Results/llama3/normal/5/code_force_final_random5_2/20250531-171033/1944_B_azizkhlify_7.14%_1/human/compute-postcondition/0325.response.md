Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the input data, printing pairs of identical integers from the first half of the input list, followed by single integers from the first half that have not been printed yet, and finally printing pairs of identical integers from the second half of the input list if necessary. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
