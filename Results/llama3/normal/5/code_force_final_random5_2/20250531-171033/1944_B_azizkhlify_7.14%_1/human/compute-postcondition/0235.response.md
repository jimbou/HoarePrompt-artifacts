The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is equal to `n`, which is the length of the list `a`, this is actually out of bounds for the list `a`. In Python, when you try to access an index that is equal to the length of the list, it will raise an `IndexError`.

However, since the problem statement asks us to determine what will be printed when the statement executes, and given that `i` is indeed equal to `n`, we can conclude that the code will raise an `IndexError` exception.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
