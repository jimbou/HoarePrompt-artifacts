The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`, which is the current element being processed in the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, it will print the first element of the list `a`. The `end=' '` argument in the print function means that a space will be printed after the element, rather than a newline.

Output: **the first element of the list a**
