Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `2 * n`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `2 * n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` as in the initial state. The only changes will be in the list `r` and the value of `i`. The list `r` will have `n` at each index from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, and `i` will be equal to `2 * n`.
