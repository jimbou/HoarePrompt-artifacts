The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n + 2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_n` is increased by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 2`**
