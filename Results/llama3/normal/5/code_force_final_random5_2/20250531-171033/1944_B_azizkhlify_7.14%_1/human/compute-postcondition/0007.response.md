Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_0 - 1` is 3, the value at index `a_1 - 1` is 1, and the value at index `a_3 - 1` is 1 and all other values are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value at index `a_3 - 1` in list `l` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.
