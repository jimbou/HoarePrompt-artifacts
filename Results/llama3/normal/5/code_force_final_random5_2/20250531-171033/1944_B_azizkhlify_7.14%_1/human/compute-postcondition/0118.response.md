Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for `i` equals to `n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`**

In this output state, the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for `i` equals to `n`. The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 1 for `i` equals to `n`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
