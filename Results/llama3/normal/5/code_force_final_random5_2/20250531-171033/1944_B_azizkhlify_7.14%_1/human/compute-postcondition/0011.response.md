To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`, so we can only adjust the state of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `n + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_n - 1` is increased by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0**
