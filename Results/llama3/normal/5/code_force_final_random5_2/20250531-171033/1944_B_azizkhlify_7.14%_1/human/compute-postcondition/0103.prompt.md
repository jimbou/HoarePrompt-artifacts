Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`, and nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`, and nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 1`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 2`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `ul` is equal to `ur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
