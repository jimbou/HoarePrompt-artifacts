Output State: `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is 0 or 2, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `2 * n`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `ul` is equal to `ur`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now `2 * n`. The loop has checked all elements in the list `a` from index `n` to `2 * n`, and for each element, it has checked if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2. If it is, it has printed the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, it has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, it has continued executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement. The program has not printed anything, and all elements in the list `res` are printed.
