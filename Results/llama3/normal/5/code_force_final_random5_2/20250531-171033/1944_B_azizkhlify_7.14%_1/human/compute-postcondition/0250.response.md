Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer greater than `n+1`. This means that `i` is out of bounds for the list `a`, since the indices of `a` range from 0 to `n-1`.
* The `print` statement attempts to print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space.

Since `i` is out of bounds for the list `a`, attempting to access `a[i]` will result in an `IndexError`. Therefore, the `print` statement will not execute successfully, and an error message will be printed instead.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
