Output State: **n is a positive integer that is at least 1, k is 0, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is i + 1 for all i from 0 to n - 1, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is n for all i from n to 2 * n - 1, re is 1, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i], stdin contains multiple test cases minus n inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, i is 0, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list res are printed, n is at least 1. If l[a[i] - 1] is 2, the current value of a[i] is printed twice with a space in between. If ul is equal to k * 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of k is not zero, i is 0. The current value of l[a[i] - 1] is 1, and the value of a[i] is printed with a space at the end.**
