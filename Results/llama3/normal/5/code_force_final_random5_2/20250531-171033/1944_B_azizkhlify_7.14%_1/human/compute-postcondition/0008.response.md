Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is the number of times a_i appears in a for all i in range(n), r is a list of n zeros, re is 0, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, i is n**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for n, k, a, r, re, ul, ur, and res as in the initial state. The list l will have the count of each number in a at the corresponding index (a_i - 1), and the loop counter i will be equal to n.
