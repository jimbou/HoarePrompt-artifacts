Output: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is either 0 or 1, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `i` is either 1 or min(k, n), nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` equals `k`, then `k` is 0, `re` is 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` is printed with a space at the end.**
