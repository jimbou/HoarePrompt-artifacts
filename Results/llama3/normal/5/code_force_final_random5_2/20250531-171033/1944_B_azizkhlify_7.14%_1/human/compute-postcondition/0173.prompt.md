Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `2 * min(k, n) - 2 * min(k, n)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 * `min(k, n)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `min(k, n)`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `k` is not zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is either 0 or 1, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `i` is either 0 or min(k, n), nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` equals `k`, then `k` is 0, `re` is 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 1 or 2, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 is printed twice with a space in between, `i` is either 1 or min(k, n), nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the value of `a[i]` is added to the list `res`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, nothing is added to the list `res`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2 or min(k, n) + 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 1 or 2, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 is printed twice with a space in between, `i` is either 2 or min(k, n) + 1. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the value of `a[i]` is added to the list `res` and printed followed by a space. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, nothing is added to the list `res`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All elements in the list `res` are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
