Output: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, re is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, ul is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, ur is 0, res is either an empty list or a list containing the values of a[i], i is n - 1. If k is not equal to 0, then l[a[i] - 1] is equal to 1, the value of a[i] has been printed and res is a list containing the values of a[i]. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. A blank line is printed.**
