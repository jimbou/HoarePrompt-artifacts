Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2 otherwise it is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[1]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and this is printed: the value of `a[1]` is printed twice with a space in between. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `a[1]` is printed twice with a space in between if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2 or if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`.
