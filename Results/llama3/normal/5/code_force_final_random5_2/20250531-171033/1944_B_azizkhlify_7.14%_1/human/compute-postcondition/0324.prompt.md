Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is equal to `ul`, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `2 * n`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `ul` is equal to `ur`, and an empty line is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 0 or `min(k, n)`, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 2 * n or 2 * min(k, n) + 2 * (n - 1), `res` is a list containing the values of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and must have at least `n` elements, `i` is either the last element in the list `res` or `2 * n - 1`, and nothing is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, `ul` is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, `ur` is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, `res` is a list containing all values of a[i], and all elements in the list `res` have been printed, `i` is 2n. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `i` is 2n. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and nothing is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
