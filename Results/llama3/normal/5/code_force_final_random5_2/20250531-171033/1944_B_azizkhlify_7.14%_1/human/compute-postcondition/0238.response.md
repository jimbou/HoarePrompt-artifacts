Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is n, stdin contains no inputs, and nothing is printed except when the value at index a[i] - 1 in `l` is 2, in which case the value of `a[i]` which is `a[n]` is printed twice.***
