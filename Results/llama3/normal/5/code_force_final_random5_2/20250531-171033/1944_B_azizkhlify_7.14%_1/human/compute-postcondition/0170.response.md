Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2 or min(k, n) + 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 1 or 2, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 is printed twice with a space in between, `i` is either 2 or min(k, n) + 1, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 2 or min(k, n) + 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the value of `a[i]` is added to the list `res`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, nothing is added to the list `res`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the value of `a[i]` is printed followed by a space.**
