State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0**
