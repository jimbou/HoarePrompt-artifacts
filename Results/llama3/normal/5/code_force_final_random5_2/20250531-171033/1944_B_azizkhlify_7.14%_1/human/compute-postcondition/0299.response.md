Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, which is the length of the list `a`, this means that `a[i]` is actually out of bounds, as the last valid index in the list is `n-1`. Therefore, `a[i]` is undefined.
* The `end=' '` argument in the print statement specifies that a space should be printed after the output.

Taking these points into account, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **undefined undefined** (where undefined represents the out-of-bounds value of `a[i]`, and the space is printed due to the `end=' '` argument)

Note that the output is not a numerical value, but rather a description of the undefined value of `a[i]`.
