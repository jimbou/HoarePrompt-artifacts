The code prints the first element in the list `res` which is a list containing the values of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and must have at least 1 element, followed by a space.
Output: **the first element in the list res (which is a list containing the values of a[i] where l[a[i] - 1] is 1) followed by a space**
