Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2 or min(k, n) + 1, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to 2 * `n - 1`, `re` is either 1 or 2, `ul` is either 2 * min(k, n) or 0, `ur` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `res` is a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 is printed twice with a space in between, `i` is either 2 or min(k, n) + 1, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the program is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement.
