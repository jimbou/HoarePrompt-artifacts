Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` for all `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `i` is 0, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed, `n` is at least 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the current value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is set to 0, and the value of `re` is set to 1. The value of `ul` is set to 0, and the value of `ur` is set to 0. The list `res` now contains the value of `a[i]` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
