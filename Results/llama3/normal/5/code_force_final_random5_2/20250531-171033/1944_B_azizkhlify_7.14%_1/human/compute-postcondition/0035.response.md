Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 2, `ul` is increased by 2, and the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is printed twice with a space in between.**

In this output state, the value of `ul` has been increased by 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The 3rd element of the list `a` is printed twice with a space in between, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
