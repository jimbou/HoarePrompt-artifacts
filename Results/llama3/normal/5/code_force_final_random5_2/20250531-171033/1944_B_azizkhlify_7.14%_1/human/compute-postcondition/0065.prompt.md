Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`. The current value of `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is the number of times a_i appears in a for all i in range(n), r is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is increased by 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n), re is 1 if the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l has a count of 1, otherwise re remains 0, ul is equal to k * 2 or n times 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the element at index i in list a if the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l has a count of 1, otherwise res remains an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, i is 0. If re equals k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the value of `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise it continues execution. In both cases, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `k` remains a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul, `a` remains a list of n integers, `l` remains a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is the number of times a_i appears in a for all i in range(n), `r` remains a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is increased by 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n), `ul` remains equal to k * 2 or n times 2, `ur` remains 0, and `res` remains a list containing the element at index i in list a if the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l has a count of 1, otherwise res is a list containing the element at index i in list a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, k is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is the number of times a_i appears in a for all i in range(n), r is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is increased by 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n), ul is equal to k * 2 or n times 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the element at index i in list a if the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l has a count of 1, otherwise res is a list containing the element at index i in list a, i is 2, and if the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l has a count of 1, the element at index 2 in list a is appended to res. If re is equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
