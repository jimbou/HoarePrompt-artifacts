Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is equal to `ul`, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is `2 * n`, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2 is printed twice. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `ul` is equal to `ur`.***
