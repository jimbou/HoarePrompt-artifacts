Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a non-zero integer equal to 4 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is the number of times a_i appears in a for all i in range(n), r is a list of n integers where the value at index a_i - 1 is increased by 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n), re is 1, ul is equal to k * 2 or n times 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the element at index i in list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, i is 0, and the current value of l[a[i] - 1] is 1, indicating that the element at index a[i] - 1 in list l has a count of 1, meaning that the corresponding element in list a appears only once, and the element at index i in list a which is a[i] is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `re` has been incremented by 1, and the element at index `i` in list `a` has been appended to the list `res`. The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is still 1, indicating that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` has a count of 1, meaning that the corresponding element in list `a` appears only once. The element at index `i` in list `a` which is `a[i]` is being printed. All other variables remain unchanged.
