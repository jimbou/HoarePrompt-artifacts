Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 and all other values are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is at least n, stdin contains no inputs, and nothing is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `r` at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 1 at that index. All other values in `r` remain 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
