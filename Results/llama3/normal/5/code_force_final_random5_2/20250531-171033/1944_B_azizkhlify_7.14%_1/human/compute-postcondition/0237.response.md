Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 2 and all other values are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is n, stdin contains no inputs, and nothing is printed. The current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, and this is printed: the value of `a[i]` which is `a[n]` and the value of `a[i]` which is `a[n]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ul` has been increased by 2, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is still 2, and the values of `a[i]` are still printed.
