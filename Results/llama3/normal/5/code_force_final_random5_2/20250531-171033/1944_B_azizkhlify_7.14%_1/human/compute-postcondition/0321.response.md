Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n) - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, `ul` is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, `ur` is either 0 or 2 or 4 or 6 or ... or 2n, `res` is a list containing all values of a[i], and all elements in the list `res` have been printed, `i` is 2n. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `i` is 2n. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
