The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, where `a[i]` is equal to the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` plus 2. This is because the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is equal to 2, which triggers the printing of `a[i]` twice.

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where a[i] is the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l plus 2)**
