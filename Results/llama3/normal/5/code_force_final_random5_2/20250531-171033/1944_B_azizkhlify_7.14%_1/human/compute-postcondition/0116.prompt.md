Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of n integers from the input, l is a list of n zeros, r is a list of n zeros, re is 0, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n - 1 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of n integers, i is 2 * n + 1, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list res are printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    l[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` - 1 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 0, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[0] - 1]` is 2 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for `i` = 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 1, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input and greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[0] - 1]` is 3 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 for `i` = 2 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for `i` = 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 2, nothing is printed, and all elements in the list `res` are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
