Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to `4 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is the number of times `a_i` appears in `a` for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a_i - 1` is increased by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, `2 * n`), `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k * 2` or `n` times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of `n` integers, `i` is 0. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, indicating that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` has a count of 1, meaning that the corresponding element in list `a` appears only once.**
