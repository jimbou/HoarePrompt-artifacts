Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is either 2 or 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or 2 or 4, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is n+1, stdin contains no inputs. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ul` is either 2 or 4, otherwise `ul` is either 0 or 2. If `i` is out of bounds, the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between.***
