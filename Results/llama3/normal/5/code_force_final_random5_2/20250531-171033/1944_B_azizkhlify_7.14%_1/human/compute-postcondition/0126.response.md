The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. However, the exact value of the first element of `a` is not provided in the precondition.

But we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, which means `a[i]` is 2 (since `l[a[i] - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 1`).

Therefore, the code will print the value 2 twice, separated by a space.

Output: **2 2**
