Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or 2 * min(k, n), `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is n and all other values are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 3 and all other values are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is at least n + 2, stdin contains no inputs, and nothing is printed.**

The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. Since the value at index `a[i] - 1` was 2, it is now 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.
