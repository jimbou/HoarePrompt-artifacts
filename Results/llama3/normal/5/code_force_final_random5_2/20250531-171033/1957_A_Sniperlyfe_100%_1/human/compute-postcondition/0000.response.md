Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, freq is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers. The variable `freq` is now assigned an empty dictionary, which is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The dictionary is initially empty, meaning it does not contain any key-value pairs.
