Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1 and the key is the second element in the list and the value is 2, `n` is the second element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `freq[n]` has been updated to 2, since `n` is the second element in the list and its frequency is incremented by 1. The other variables, `arr` and `n`, remain unchanged.
