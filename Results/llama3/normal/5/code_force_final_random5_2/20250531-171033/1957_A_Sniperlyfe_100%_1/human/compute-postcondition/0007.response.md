Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is each unique element in the list and the value is the frequency of that element, `n` is the last element in the list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be that the `arr` list remains unchanged, the `freq` dictionary will contain key-value pairs for each unique element in the list, where the key is the element and the value is the frequency of that element in the list, and `n` will be the last element in the list.
