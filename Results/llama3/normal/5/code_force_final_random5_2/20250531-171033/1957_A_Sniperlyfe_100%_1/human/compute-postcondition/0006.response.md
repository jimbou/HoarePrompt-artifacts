Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1 and the key is the second element in the list and the value is 2 and the key is the third element in the list and the value is 4, `n` is the third element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `freq[n]` has been updated to 4, which is the result of adding 1 to its previous value of 3. The other variables, `arr` and `n`, remain unchanged. The dictionary `freq` still has three key-value pairs, but the value associated with the key `n` (which is the third element in the list) has been incremented by 1.
