#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is each unique element in the list and the value is the frequency of that element, `n` is the last element in the list.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of integer division of the frequency of each unique element in the list by 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique element in the list by 3. The function does not modify the input list.
