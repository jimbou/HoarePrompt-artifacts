Output State: **The program returns the sum of integer division of the frequency of each unique element in the list by 3.**

In this output state, the frequency of each unique element in the list is obtained from the dictionary `freq`, where each key is a unique element in the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element. The integer division of each frequency by 3 is calculated, and the results are summed up to produce the final output.
