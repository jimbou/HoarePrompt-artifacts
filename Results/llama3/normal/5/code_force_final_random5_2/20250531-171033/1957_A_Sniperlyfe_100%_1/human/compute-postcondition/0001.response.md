According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `freq` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element and `n` is the first element in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the first element in the list**
