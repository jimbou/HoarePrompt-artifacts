The value of `freq[n]` is assigned the value of `freq.get(n, 0) + 1`, where `freq.get(n, 0)` returns the value of `freq[n]` if it exists, otherwise it returns 0. Since `freq` is an empty dictionary, `freq.get(n, 0)` returns 0. Therefore, `freq[n]` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1, `n` is the first element in the list**
