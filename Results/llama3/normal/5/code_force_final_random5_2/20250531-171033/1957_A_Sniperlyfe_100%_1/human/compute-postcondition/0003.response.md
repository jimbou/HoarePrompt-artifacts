According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1, `n` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `n` is the second element in the list and `freq` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1 and the key is the second element in the list and the value is 1.
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1 and the key is the second element in the list and the value is 1, `n` is the second element in the list**
