Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. The coordinates of the square's corners (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) are still integers. The variable `res` is now assigned the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. The input stream still contains `t-4` test cases, each with four lines of two integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners.
