Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers. Additionally, either x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4. The current value of x1 is equal to x2 and x3 is equal to x4. y1 is not less than y2.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which are the y-coordinates of two corners of a square. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, each with four lines of coordinates. The properties of the coordinates, such as the range and the relationships between them, are also preserved.
