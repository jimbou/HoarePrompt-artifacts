Postcondition: ***a is at least 2, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. If either x1 == x2 and x3 == x4 or x1 == x4 and x3 == x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if y1 is less than y2, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2.***
