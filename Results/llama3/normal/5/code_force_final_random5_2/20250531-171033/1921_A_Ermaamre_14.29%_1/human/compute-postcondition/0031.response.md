Output State: **a is at least 2, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of 'a' is still at least 2, 'i' is still 1, and the values of x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are still integers. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, each test case containing four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i within the range -1000 to 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. Additionally, a new variable 'res' has been introduced, which is the absolute difference between the values of y1 and y3.
