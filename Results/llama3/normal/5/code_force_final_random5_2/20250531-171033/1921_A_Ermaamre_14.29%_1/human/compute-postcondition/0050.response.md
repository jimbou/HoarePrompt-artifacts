Output State: **a is at least 3, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of 'a' is still at least 3, and 'i' is still 2. The values of x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are still integers, and the input contains t-4 test cases, each with four lines of two integers. The coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area are still stored in x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4. The variable 'res' now holds the absolute difference between y1 and y2.
