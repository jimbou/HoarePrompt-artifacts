Output State: **a is at least 1, i equals a - 1, stdin is empty, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1. If x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1. If x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1, and the square of the result is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the program has processed all the test cases. The value of `a` is at least 1, indicating that the loop executed at least once. The value of `i` is equal to `a - 1`, indicating that the loop executed `a` times. The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all the test cases have been processed. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers, and the value of `res` is calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The square of the result is printed for each test case.
