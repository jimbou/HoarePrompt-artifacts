Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers. Additionally, either `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, and either `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x3` is not equal to `x4`. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.***
