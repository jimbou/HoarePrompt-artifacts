Postcondition: ***a is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers. Additionally, either x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4, and either x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4. The current value of x1 is equal to x4 and the current value of x3 is equal to x2***
