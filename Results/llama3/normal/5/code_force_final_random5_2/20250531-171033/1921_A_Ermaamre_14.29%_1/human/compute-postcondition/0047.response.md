Output State: **a is at least 3, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3.**

In this output state, the value of res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3, which means it is the absolute value of the difference between the y-coordinates of the first and third corners of the square. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
