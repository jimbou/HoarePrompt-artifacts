Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39

The program will not correctly calculate the area of the square for the last set of coordinates (45 11, 45 39, 17 11, 17 39). The program assumes that the coordinates are given in a specific order, but the problem statement does not guarantee this.

A correct solution would need to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, and then calculate the area of the square based on these values. The program does not do this, and instead relies on the specific order of the coordinates to calculate the area.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())
        (x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        (x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())
        (x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())
        x_coords = [x1, x2, x3, x4]
        y_coords = [y1, y2, y3, y4]
        min_x = min(x_coords)
        max_x = max(x_coords)
        min_y = min(y_coords)
        max_y = max(y_coords)
        res = abs(max_x - min_x)
        print(res ** 2)
```

This solution correctly calculates the area of the square for all possible inputs.
