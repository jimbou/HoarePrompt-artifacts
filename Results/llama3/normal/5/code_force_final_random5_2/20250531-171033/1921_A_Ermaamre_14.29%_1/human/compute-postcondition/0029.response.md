Output State: **a is at least 2, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.**

The code reads four lines of input from stdin, each containing two integers x_i and y_i, which are assigned to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4, respectively. The values of these variables are integers within the range -1000 to 1000. The code does not modify the values of a and i, which remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 test cases, each with four lines of input.
