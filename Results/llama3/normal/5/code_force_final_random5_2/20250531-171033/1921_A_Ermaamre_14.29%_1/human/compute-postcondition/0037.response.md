Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y4` are integers, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000)**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which are integers representing the y-coordinates of two corners of a square. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3 test cases, each with four lines of two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
