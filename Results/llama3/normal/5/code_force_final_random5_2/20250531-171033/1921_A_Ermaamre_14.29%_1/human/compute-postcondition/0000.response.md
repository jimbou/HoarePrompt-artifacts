The code `a = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `a`. Since the stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases, the first integer is assigned to `a`. The remaining input remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.**
