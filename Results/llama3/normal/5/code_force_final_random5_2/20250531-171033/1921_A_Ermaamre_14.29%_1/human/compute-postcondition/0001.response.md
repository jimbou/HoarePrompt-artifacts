The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is at least 1 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.**
