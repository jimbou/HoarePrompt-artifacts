Output State: **a is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers.**

The code reads four lines of input from stdin, each containing two integers, and assigns them to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4. The values of these variables are now integers, and their values are within the range -1000 to 1000. The variables a and i remain unchanged, and stdin now contains t-1 test cases.
