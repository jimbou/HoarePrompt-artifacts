The code prints the square of the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two opposite corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.

The square is defined by the coordinates of its corners (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), and (x4, y4). The coordinates are integers and are given as input in four lines, each containing two integers.

The absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two opposite corners is calculated based on the orientation of the square. If the x-coordinates of the top and bottom corners are equal (x1 == x3 and x2 == x4), then the absolute difference is between y3 and y1. If the x-coordinates of the left and right corners are equal (x1 == x2 and x3 == x4 or x1 == x4 and x3 == x2), then the absolute difference is between y2 and y1.

The square of this absolute difference is then printed.

Output: **the square of the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two opposite corners of the square**
