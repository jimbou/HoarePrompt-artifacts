Postcondition: **a is at least 2, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1 if y1 is less than y3, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3.**
