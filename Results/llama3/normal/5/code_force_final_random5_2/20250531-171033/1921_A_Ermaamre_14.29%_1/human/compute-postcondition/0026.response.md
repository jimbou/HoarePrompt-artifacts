Based on the precondition, the code is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The corners are represented by four pairs of integers (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), and (x4, y4).

The variable `res` is calculated based on the following conditions:

1. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then `res` is the absolute difference between y3 and y1.
2. If x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then `res` is the absolute difference between y2 and y1.
3. If x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then `res` is the absolute difference between y2 and y1.

The `print` statement prints the square of the value of `res`.

Since the exact values of x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the square of the length of the side of the square.

Output: **the square of the length of the side of the square (where the length is the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two opposite corners)**
