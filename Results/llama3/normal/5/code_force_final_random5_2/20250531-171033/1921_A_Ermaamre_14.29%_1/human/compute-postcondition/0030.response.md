Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is now the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the third and first corners of the square. All other variables remain unchanged, and the input stream still contains t-3 test cases, each with four lines of two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
