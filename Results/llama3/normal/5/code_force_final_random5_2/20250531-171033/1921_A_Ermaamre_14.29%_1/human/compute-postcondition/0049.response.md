Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000).**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, which means it will be a non-negative integer. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases, each with four lines of two integers.
