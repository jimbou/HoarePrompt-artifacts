Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1. If x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1. If x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1, and the square of the result is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is at least 2, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. If x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1 if y1 is less than y3, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If either x1 == x2 and x3 == x4 or x1 == x4 and x3 == x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if y1 is less than y2, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2, and the square of res is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is at least 3, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. If x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1 if y1 is less than y3, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If either x1 == x2 and x3 == x4 or x1 == x4 and x3 == x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if y1 is less than y2, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2. In all cases, the square of res is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
