Output State: **a is at least 3, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. If x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1 if y1 is less than y3, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If either x1 == x2 and x3 == x4 or x1 == x4 and x3 == x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if y1 is less than y2, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2, and the square of res is being printed.**

The code reads four lines of input, each containing two integers, and assigns them to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4. The values of these variables are integers, and their ranges are between -1000 and 1000. The code does not modify the values of a and i, which remain at least 3 and 2, respectively. The stdin now contains t-4 test cases, each with four lines of input. The code does not print any output, but it sets up the variables for potential future calculations involving the absolute differences between the y-coordinates and the squares of these differences.
