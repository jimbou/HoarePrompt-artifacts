Postcondition: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers. The current value of `x1` equals the current value of `x3` and the current value of `x2` equals the current value of `x4`. The absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` is calculated and stored in `res`, regardless of whether `y1` is less than or greater than or equal to `y3`.**
