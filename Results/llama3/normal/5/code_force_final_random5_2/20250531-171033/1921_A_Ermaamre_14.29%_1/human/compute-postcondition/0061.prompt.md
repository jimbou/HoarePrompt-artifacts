You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: a is at least 1, i equals a - 1, stdin is empty, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1. If x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1. If x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1, and the square of the result is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: a is at least 1, i equals a - 1, stdin is empty, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1. If x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1. If x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4, then if x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1, and the square of the result is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
