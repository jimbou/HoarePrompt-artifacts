Output State: **a is at least 2, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2.**

In this output state, the value of res is calculated as the absolute difference between y1 and y2, which are the y-coordinates of the first and second corners of the square, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3 test cases, each with four lines of two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
