Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers. Additionally, either `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`. The current value of `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`. The current value of `y1` is less than `y2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is still at least 1, and the value of `i` is still 0. The variable `res` is now assigned the absolute difference between the values of `y2` and `y1`. The input state remains the same, with t-1 test cases, each containing four lines of two integers representing the coordinates of a square's corners. The relationships between the coordinates, such as `x1` being equal to `x2` and `x3` being equal to `x4`, and `y1` being less than `y2`, are still valid.
