Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` or the current element of `arr` at index `i`, `nums` is a list of integers that includes the digits of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`, if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False, 'NO' is printed, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to the first digit of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` or the current element of `arr` at index `i`, which is stored in `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
