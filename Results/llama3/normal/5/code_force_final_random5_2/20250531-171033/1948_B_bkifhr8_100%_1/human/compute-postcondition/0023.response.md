Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is 1, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains n-2 test cases, ans is True if all nums were sorted, otherwise ans is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `m` is 1, and the value of `ans` is True if all `nums` were sorted during the loop iterations, otherwise `ans` is False. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
