Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the current element at index `i` is less than the previous element at index `i-1`, `arr[i - 1]` is the smallest digit of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`, `ans` is False since not all elements of `arr` are sorted in ascending order, 'NO' is printed, and `nums` is a list of integers that includes the digits of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the smallest digit of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`, which is stored in `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
