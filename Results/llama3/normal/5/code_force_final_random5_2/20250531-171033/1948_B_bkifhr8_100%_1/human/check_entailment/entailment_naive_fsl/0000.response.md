Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will output "YES", but it should output "NO" because the array [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the current element is less than the previous element, and if so, it tries to split the previous element into digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted using the given operation.

A correct approach would be to iterate through the array from left to right, and for each element, check if it can be split into digits that are in non-decreasing order. If any element cannot be split into digits that are in non-decreasing order, the program should output "NO". Otherwise, it should output "YES".

Here is an example of a correct program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i])]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

This program correctly checks if each element can be split into digits that are in non-decreasing order, and outputs "NO" if any element cannot be split in this way.
