Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, arr is a list of integers, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[0] and the last element is arr[1], ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `ans`, which is now `False`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
