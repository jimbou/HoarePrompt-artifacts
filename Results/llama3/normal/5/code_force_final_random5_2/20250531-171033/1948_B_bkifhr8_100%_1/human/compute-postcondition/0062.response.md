Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `nums` is a list of integers that includes the digits of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`, if the current element at index `i` is less than the previous element at index `i-1`, then `arr[i - 1]` is the smallest digit of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`, `ans` is False since not all elements of `arr` are sorted in ascending order, and 'NO' is printed, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and greater than 2. The value of `_` remains 2. The value of `m` remains at least 1. The value of `i` remains 0. The value of `arr` remains a list of integers. The value of `nums` is updated to include the digits of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`. If the current element at index `i` is less than the previous element at index `i-1`, then `arr[i - 1]` is the smallest digit of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`, `ans` is False, and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
