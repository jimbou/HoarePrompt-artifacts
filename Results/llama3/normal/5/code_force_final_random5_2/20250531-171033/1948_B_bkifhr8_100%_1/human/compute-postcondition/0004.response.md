Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is True, `stdin` contains `n-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 1`. The current value of `i` is such that the element at index `i` in `arr` is less than the element at index `i - 1` in `arr`.***
