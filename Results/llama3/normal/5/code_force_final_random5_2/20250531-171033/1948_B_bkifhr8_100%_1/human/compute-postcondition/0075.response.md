Based on the precondition, the code will print either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on whether the array `arr` is sorted in ascending order or not.

If any pair of adjacent elements in `arr` are not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False, and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is True, and 'YES' is printed.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'NO' or 'YES' indicating whether the array `arr` is sorted in ascending order or not.

Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 0, i is -m, arr is a list of integers. If any pair of adjacent elements in arr were not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, ans is True and 'YES' is printed, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed indicating whether the array `arr` is sorted in ascending order or not.**
