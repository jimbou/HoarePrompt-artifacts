The code updates the value of `nums` by creating a new list that includes the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers and the value of `arr[i]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[0]` and the last element is `arr[1]`, `ans` is False if the new `nums` is not sorted, otherwise no changes are made.**
