Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr` and the second element is the original second element of `arr`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original first element of `arr` and the last element is the original second element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then no changes are made to `ans`.***
