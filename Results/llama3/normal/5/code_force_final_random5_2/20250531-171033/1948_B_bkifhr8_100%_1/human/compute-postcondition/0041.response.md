Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers. If the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, then `arr` is updated such that the second element is the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
