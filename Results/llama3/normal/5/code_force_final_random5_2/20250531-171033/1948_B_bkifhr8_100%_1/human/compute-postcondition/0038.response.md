Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, arr is a list of integers, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[1] and the last element is arr[2], ans is False**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `n`, `_`, `m`, `i`, `arr`, or `nums`. The first line assigns the value `False` to `ans`, which is the only change made by the code. The `break` statement is not executed because it is not within a loop, so it does not affect the state of the program.
