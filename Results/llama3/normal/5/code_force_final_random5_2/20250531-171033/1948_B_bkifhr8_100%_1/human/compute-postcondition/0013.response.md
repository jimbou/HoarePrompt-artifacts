Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is an integer and is at least 3, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains n-2 test cases, i is m - 2, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index i - 1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr, ans is False**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the program's execution.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the assignment of `False` to the variable `ans`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
