Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 0, i is -m, arr is a list of integers. If any pair of adjacent elements in arr were not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, ans is True and 'YES' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `m` will be 0, and `i` will be `-m`. The value of `arr` will be the same as the initial value, but if any pair of adjacent elements in `arr` were not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` will be `False` and `'NO'` will be printed. Otherwise, `ans` will be `True` and `'YES'` will be printed. The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged.
