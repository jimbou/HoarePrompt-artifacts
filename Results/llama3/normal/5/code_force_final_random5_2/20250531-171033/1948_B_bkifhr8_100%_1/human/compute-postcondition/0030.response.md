Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains `n-4` test cases, `ans` is True, `i` is `m-1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the code has created a new list `nums` by first converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string, then iterating over each character (digit) in the string and converting it back to an integer. This list of digits is then appended with the integer `arr[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and greater than 1, `_` being 1, `m` being an integer greater than 1, `arr` being a list of integers, `stdin` containing `n-4` test cases, `ans` being True, and `i` being `m-1`. Additionally, the relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` remains the same, with `arr[i]` being less than `arr[i - 1]`.
