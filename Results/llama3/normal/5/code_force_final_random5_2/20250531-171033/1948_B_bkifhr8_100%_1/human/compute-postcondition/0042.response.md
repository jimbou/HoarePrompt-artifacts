To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `m - 1` down to `1` in reverse order, decrementing `i` by `1` each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1
* `_` is 1
* `m` is an integer greater than 1
* `i` is 2
* `arr` is a list of integers
* `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`
* `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise no changes are made

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `m`, as they are the only variables involved in the loop head.

Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be 1.

The value of `m` does not change, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`, `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise no changes are made**
