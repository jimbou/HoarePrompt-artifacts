Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, ans is True, stdin contains n-2 test cases**

The code executes in the following way: 

- The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `m`. This means that `m` is now an integer and stdin contains n-2 test cases.
- The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. This means that `arr` is now a list of integers and stdin contains n-2 test cases.
- The third line assigns the boolean value `True` to `ans`. This means that `ans` is now `True`.

The values of `n` and `_` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, and the value of `_` is still 0.
