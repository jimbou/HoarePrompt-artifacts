Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains n-4 test cases, ans is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers. If the second element of `arr` is less than the first element, then `arr` is updated such that the second element is the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr` and the second element is the original second element of `arr`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original first element of `arr` and the last element is the original second element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then no changes are made to `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
