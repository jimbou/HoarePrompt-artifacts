Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, ans is True, stdin contains n-2 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains `n-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr` is a list of integers where the element at index `i - 1` is the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is an integer and is at least 3, arr is a list of integers. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then arr is a list of integers where the element at index i - 1 is the first element of nums, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index i - 1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr. If nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, no change is made. Otherwise, no change is made. In all cases, stdin contains n-2 test cases and i is m - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is an integer and is at least 4, arr is a list of integers. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then arr is a list of integers where the element at index i - 1 is the first element of nums, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index i - 1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr. If nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
