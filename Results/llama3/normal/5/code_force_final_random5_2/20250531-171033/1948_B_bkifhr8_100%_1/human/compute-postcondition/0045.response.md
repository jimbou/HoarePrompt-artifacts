Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[0]` and the last element is `arr[1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
