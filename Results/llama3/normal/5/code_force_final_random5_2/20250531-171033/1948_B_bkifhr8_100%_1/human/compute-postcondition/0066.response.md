Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is an integer that is at least 1, i is 0, arr is a list of integers. If the current element at index i is less than the previous element at index i-1, then arr[i - 1] is the smallest digit of the previous element of arr at index i-1 and the current element of arr at index i, ans is False since not all elements of arr are sorted in ascending order, 'NO' is printed, and nums is a list of integers that includes the digits of the previous element of arr at index i-1 and the current element of arr at index i. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
