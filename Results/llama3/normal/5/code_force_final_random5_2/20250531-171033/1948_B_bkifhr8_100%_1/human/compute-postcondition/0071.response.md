Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 1, `i` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers where the element at index `i-1` is the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first element of `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still -1, so `arr[i - 1]` is actually `arr[-2]`, which means the second last element of `arr` has been updated. The relationship between `nums` and `arr` is still maintained, and the condition on `ans` is still applicable.
