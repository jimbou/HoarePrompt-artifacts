Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
