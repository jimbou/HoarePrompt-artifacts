Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 1, `i` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the values of `arr` and `i`. The first elements of `nums` are the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr`, which means that if the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` is a multi-digit number, it will be broken down into individual digits and added to `nums`. The last element of `nums` is the integer at index `i` in `arr`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
