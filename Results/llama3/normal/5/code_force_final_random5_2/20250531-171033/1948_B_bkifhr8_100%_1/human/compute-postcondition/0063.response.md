Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is an integer that is at least 1, i is 0, arr is a list of integers, nums is a list of integers that includes the digits of the previous element of arr at index i-1 and the current element of arr at index i, ans is False, 'NO' is printed**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was previously `False` since not all elements of `arr` are sorted in ascending order. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the program's execution.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the explicit assignment of `False` to `ans`, which was already `False` due to the initial condition. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
