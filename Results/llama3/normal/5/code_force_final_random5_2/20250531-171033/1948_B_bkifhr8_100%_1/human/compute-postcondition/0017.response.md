The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `m - 3`. For `i` to be `m - 3`, `m` must be at least 4.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is an integer and is at least 4, arr is a list of integers. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then arr is a list of integers where the element at index i - 1 is the first element of nums, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index i - 1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr. If nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, no change is made. Otherwise, no change is made. In all cases, stdin contains n-2 test cases and i is m - 3**
