Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is equal to 0, _ is n-1, m is 0, i is -m, arr is a list of integers. If any pair of adjacent elements in arr were not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, ans is True and 'YES' is printed, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed indicating whether the array `arr` is sorted in ascending order or not.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n-1 times, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The value of n is still between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, but it is now equal to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of _ is n-1, which is the number of iterations the loop has executed. The value of m is 0, which is the value it takes after the last iteration of the loop. The value of i is -m, which is the value it takes after the last iteration of the loop. The value of arr is a list of integers, and the value of ans is True if all pairs of adjacent elements in arr are sorted in ascending order, and False otherwise. The output of the loop is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the array arr is sorted in ascending order or not.
