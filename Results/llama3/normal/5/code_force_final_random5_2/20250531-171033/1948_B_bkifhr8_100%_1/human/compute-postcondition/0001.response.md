According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, and stdin contains n-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains n-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
