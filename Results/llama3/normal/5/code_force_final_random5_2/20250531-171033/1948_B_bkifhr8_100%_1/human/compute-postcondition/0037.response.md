Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`. The digits of `arr[1]` are obtained by converting `arr[1]` to a string and then converting each character back to an integer. The last element of `nums` is simply `arr[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
