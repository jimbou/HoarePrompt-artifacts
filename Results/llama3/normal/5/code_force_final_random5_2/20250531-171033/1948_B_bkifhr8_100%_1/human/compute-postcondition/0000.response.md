The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t test cases, the first integer t is assigned to `n`. The remaining input in stdin is t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains n-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).**
