Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`, stdin contains `n-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` has been updated to include the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr` and the integer at index `i` in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-2` test cases. The value of `i` is still `m - 3`. The list `arr` is still a list of integers. The value of `m` is still an integer and is at least 4. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0.
