Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It checks if the integers in each test case can be sorted in ascending order by only replacing the first element of each pair of adjacent elements that are not in ascending order with the smallest digit of the first element. If all pairs of adjacent elements can be sorted in this way, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each one.**
