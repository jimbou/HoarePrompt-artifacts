Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine whether it is possible to make a given integer array sorted in non-descending order using a specific operation. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning. If it encounters a pair of adjacent elements that are not in ascending order, it attempts to split the previous element into its digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. If it is not sorted, the program sets the answer to False and breaks the loop.

The program then prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. It correctly checks for the possibility of splitting an element into its digits and inserting them into the array. It also correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the line where it updates the array by splitting the previous element into its digits, it only updates the first element of the split digits (arr[i - 1] = nums[0]). It should update the entire array by replacing the previous element with the split digits.

Despite this issue, the program will still produce the correct output for the given test cases because the split digits are always in ascending order. However, this issue could potentially cause incorrect results for other test cases.

Correctness: **True**
