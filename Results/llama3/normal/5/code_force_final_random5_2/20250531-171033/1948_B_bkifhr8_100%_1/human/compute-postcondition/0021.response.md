Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers where the element at index `i - 1` is the first element of `nums`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`, `stdin` contains `n-2` test cases. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first element of `nums`, which is the digit of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `ans` is still dependent on whether `nums` is sorted or not.
