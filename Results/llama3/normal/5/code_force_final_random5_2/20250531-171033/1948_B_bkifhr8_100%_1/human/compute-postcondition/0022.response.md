Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is an integer and is at least 4, arr is a list of integers. If arr[i] is less than arr[i - 1], then arr is a list of integers where the element at index i - 1 is the first element of nums, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index i - 1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr. If nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
