Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is an integer and is at least 3, arr is a list of integers where the element at index i - 1 is the first element of nums, i is m - 2, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index i - 1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr. If nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, no change is made, stdin contains n-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the element at index i - 1 in the list arr is updated to be the first element of the list nums. All other variables remain unchanged. The list nums still contains the digits of the integer at index i - 1 in arr as its first elements and the integer at index i in arr as its last element. The value of ans is still False if nums is not sorted, and no change is made otherwise. The number of test cases in stdin remains n-2.
