Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains n-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is 1, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains n-2 test cases, ans is True if all nums were sorted, otherwise ans is False, and 'YES' is printed if ans is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 1, i is 0, arr is a list of integers where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of arr and the rest of the elements are the original elements of arr starting from the second element, ans is True if all the elements of arr are sorted in ascending order, otherwise ans is False, and 'YES' is printed if ans is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 0, i is -m, arr is a list of integers. If any pair of adjacent elements in arr were not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, ans is True and 'YES' is printed, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed indicating whether the array `arr` is sorted in ascending order or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
