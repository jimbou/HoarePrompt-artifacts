Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `m` is an integer that is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the current element at index `i` is less than the previous element at index `i-1`, `ans` is False since not all elements of `arr` are sorted in ascending order, 'NO' is printed, and `nums` is a list of integers that includes the digits of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` and the current element of `arr` at index `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `_`, `m`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remains the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `nums`, which is a list of integers. This list includes the digits of the previous element of `arr` at index `i-1` (which is converted to a string and then to a list of integers) and the current element of `arr` at index `i`. The 'NO' message is still printed.
