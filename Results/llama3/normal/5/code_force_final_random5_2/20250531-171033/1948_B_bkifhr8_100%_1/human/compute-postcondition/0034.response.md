Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` as an integer, `stdin` contains `n-4` test cases, `i` is `m-1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`. If the list `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` as an integer. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` has been modified, but the relationship between `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is still maintained, where `arr[i]` is less than the updated `arr[i - 1]`. The value of `ans` is still dependent on whether the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not.
