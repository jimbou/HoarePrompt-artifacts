The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` is `m - 2`. Since `m` is at least 2, `m - 2` is at least 0. However, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0, so `m - 2` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `m` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains `n-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr` is a list of integers where the element at index `i - 1` is the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
