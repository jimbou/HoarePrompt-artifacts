Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, _ is 2, m is an integer, i is 0, arr is a list of integers, ans is True if all the elements of arr are sorted in ascending order, otherwise ans is False, and 'YES' is printed if ans is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, and n must be greater than 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is an integer that is at least 2, i is 1, arr is a list of integers. If the current element at index i is less than the previous element at index i-1, then arr[i - 1] is the smallest digit of the previous element of arr at index i-1 and the current element of arr at index i, ans is False since not all elements of arr are sorted in ascending order, 'NO' is printed, and nums is a list of integers that includes the digits of the previous element of arr at index i-1 and the current element of arr at index i. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is an integer that is at least 1, i is 0, arr is a list of integers. If the current element at index i is less than the previous element at index i-1, then arr[i - 1] is the smallest digit of the previous element of arr at index i-1 and the current element of arr at index i, ans is False since not all elements of arr are sorted in ascending order, 'NO' is printed, and nums is a list of integers that includes the digits of the previous element of arr at index i-1 and the current element of arr at index i. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is an integer that is at least 1, i is -1, arr is a list of integers. If the element at index i in arr is less than the element at index i-1 in arr, then nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index i-1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr. If nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
