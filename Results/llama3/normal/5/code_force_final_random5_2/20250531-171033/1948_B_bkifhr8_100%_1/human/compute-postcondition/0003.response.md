To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 2, because the loop starts from `m - 1` and goes down to 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `m` to be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is True, `stdin` contains `n-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 1`**
