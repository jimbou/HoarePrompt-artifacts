Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is an integer that is at least 1, i is -1, arr is a list of integers. If the element at index i in arr is less than the element at index i-1 in arr, then nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index i-1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr. If nums is not sorted, then ans is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
