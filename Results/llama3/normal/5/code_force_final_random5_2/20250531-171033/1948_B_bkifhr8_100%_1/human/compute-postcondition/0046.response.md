Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr` and the second element is the original second element of `arr`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original first element of `arr` and the last element is the original second element of `arr`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of the original first element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `nums` still contains the digits of the original first element of `arr` and the original second element of `arr`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
