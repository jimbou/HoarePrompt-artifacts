Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times. 

The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, and for each pair of adjacent elements that are not in ascending order, it checks if the first element can be replaced with its digits to make the pair sorted. If it can, it updates the first element with the smallest digit; otherwise, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the operation cannot make the array sorted.

Correctness: **True**
