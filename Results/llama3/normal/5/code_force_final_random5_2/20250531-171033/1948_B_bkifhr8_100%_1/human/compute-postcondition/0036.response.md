The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 0, so `i` is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2**
