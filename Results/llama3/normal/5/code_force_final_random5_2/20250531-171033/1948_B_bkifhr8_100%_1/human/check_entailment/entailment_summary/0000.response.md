Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. It then iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (to avoid index issues when modifying the array). 

3. For each pair of adjacent elements that are not in ascending order, it checks if the first element can be split into digits and these digits along with the second element can be sorted in ascending order. 

4. If this condition is not met for any pair of adjacent elements, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop.

5. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
