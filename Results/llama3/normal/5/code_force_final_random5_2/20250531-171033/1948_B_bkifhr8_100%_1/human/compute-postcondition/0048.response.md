Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 1, i is 0, arr is a list of integers where the first element is the first digit of the original first element of arr and the rest of the elements are the original elements of arr starting from the second element, ans is True if all the elements of arr are sorted in ascending order, otherwise ans is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `m` becomes 1, and the value of `i` becomes 0. The list `arr` is modified such that its first element is the first digit of the original first element of `arr`, and the rest of the elements remain the same as the original elements of `arr` starting from the second element. The variable `ans` is set to True if all the elements of `arr` are sorted in ascending order, otherwise it is set to False. The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged.
