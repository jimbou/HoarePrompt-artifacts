Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains `n-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` has been updated to include the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr` and the integer at index `i` in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `nums` now contains the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr` followed by the integer at index `i` in `arr`.
