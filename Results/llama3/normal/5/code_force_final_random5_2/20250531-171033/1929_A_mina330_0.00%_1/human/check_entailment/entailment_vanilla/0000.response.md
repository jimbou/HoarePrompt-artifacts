Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program first reads the number of test cases (ntest) and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (n) and the elements of the array (a).

4. It sorts the array in ascending order.

5. It then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between the elements at the end of the array and the elements at the beginning of the array. This is done by iterating over the first half of the array and adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning.

6. Finally, it prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

7. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements.

Correctness: **True**
