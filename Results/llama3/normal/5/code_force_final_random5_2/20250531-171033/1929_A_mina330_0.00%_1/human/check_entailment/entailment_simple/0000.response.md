Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the array. This sum represents the maximum beauty of the array.

The program's logic is correct because it takes advantage of the fact that the beauty of the array is maximized when the largest elements are placed at the end and the smallest elements are placed at the beginning. By sorting the array and calculating the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning, the program effectively finds the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
