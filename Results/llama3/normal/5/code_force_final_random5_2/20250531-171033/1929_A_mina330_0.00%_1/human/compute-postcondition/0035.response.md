Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of the differences between corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted list, and prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.**
