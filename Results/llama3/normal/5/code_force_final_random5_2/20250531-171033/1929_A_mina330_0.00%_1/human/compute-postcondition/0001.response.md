The only variables in the loop head are variables  itest and ntest, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ntest`. If ntest is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, ntest is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `ntest` is greater than 0 and itest is now 0.
State: **`ntest` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, with the first line of the first test case having been read, `itest` is 0, `ntest` must be greater than 0**
