To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least 2 elements (since we're iterating over half of its length). We also need to define `i` and set it to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`itest` is 2, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is 0, `i` is 0**
