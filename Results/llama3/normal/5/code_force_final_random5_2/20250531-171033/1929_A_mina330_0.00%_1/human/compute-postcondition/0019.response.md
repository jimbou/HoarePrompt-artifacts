Output State: **`itest` is 2, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `kq` is 3 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]), `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `itest` remains 2, `ntest` is still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the number of test cases in `stdin` remains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, the value of `kq` is updated to 3 times the difference between the third last element and the second element of list `a`, and `i` remains 2.
