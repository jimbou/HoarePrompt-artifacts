Output State: **`itest` is 2, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is 2 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]), `i` is 1**

The value of `kq` is updated by adding the difference between the second last element and the second element of the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, `a[len(a) - i - 1]` refers to the second last element and `a[i]` refers to the second element. The value of `kq` is now twice the difference between these two elements. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
