Output State: **`itest` is 1, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is recalculated to `kq + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `itest` remains 1, `ntest` is still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases. The value of `n` remains an integer, and `a` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements. The value of `kq` is updated by adding the difference between the second last element of `a` and the second element of `a`. The value of `i` remains 1.
