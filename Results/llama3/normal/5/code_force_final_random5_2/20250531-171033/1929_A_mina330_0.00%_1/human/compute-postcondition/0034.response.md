Output State: **itest is equal to ntest, ntest is an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains no test cases, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, kq is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of a, i is 0, and the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of a which is kq is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases, and the variables `itest`, `ntest`, `n`, `a`, `kq`, and `i` have reached their final values. The loop has processed all the test cases in `stdin`, and the final value of `kq` is being printed.
