Output State: **`itest` is 1, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of `a`, `i` is `len(a) // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `itest` remains 1, `ntest` is still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` still contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input, `n` is still an integer, and `a` is still a sorted list of integers. However, `kq` is now the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of `a`, and `i` is now `len(a) // 2`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
