To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the step size is 1), so `i` becomes 1. The length of `a` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, the condition `i < len(a) // 2` still holds.

State: **`itest` is 3, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `i` is 1**
