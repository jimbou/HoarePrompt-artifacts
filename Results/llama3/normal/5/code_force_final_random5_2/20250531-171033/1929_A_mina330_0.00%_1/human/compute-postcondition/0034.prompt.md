Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ntest` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, with the first line of the first test case having been read.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    kq = 0
    for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
        kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
    print(kq)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `itest` is 1, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of `a`, `i` is `len(a) // 2`, and the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of `a` which is `kq` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: itest is 2, ntest is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, kq is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list a, i is len(a) // 2 - 1, and the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list a which is kq is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: itest is 3, ntest is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 test cases, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers with at least len(a) // 2 elements, kq is len(a) // 2 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]), i is len(a) // 2 - 1, and the value of kq is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
