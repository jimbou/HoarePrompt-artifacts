To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `ntest`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `itest` is less than `ntest`. At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 2 and `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `itest` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`itest` is 3, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list `a`, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`, and the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list `a` which is `kq` is being printed**
