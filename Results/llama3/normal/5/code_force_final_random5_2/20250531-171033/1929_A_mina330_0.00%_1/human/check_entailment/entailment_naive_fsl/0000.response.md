Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and the program sorts the array in ascending order to maximize this sum.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array. It sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program correctly handles the case where the array has an even number of elements, where the middle elements are paired with each other, and the case where the array has an odd number of elements, where the middle element is not paired with any other element.

The program also correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same, in which case the beauty of the array is 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
