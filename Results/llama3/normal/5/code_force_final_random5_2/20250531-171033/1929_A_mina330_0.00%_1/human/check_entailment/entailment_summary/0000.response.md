Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The provided program sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted list. This approach is correct because it maximizes the beauty of the array by placing the largest elements at the end and the smallest elements at the beginning, thus maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the maximum beauty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
