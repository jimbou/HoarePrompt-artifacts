To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least 2 elements (since we're iterating over half of its length). Before the loop starts, `itest` is 1, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `kq` is 0.

State: **`itest` is 1, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is 0, `i` is 0**
