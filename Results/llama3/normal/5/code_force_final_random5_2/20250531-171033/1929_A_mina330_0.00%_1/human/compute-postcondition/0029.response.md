To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `a` is still at least 2, but since `i` is now 2, the loop will only execute again if `len(a)` is at least 4.

State: **`itest` is 3, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `kq` is 2 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]), `i` is 2**
