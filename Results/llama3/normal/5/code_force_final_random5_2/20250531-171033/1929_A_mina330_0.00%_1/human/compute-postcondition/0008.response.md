Output State: **`itest` is 1, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `kq` is recalculated to `kq + a[len(a) - 3] - a[2]`, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `itest` remains 1, `ntest` is still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` still contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input, `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `kq` is updated by adding the difference between the third last element and the third element of list `a`, and `i` is still 2.
