Output State: **`itest` is 3, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `kq` is 2 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]), `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `kq` has been updated to be twice the difference between the last element and the first element of the list `a`, since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
