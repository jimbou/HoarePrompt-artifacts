Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of yogurts to buy is odd. In this case, the program will round up the total cost to the nearest integer, which is not the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend.

For example, if the input is "3 5 9", the program will calculate the total cost as 3 * 4.5 = 13.5, which will be rounded up to 14. However, the correct minimum cost is 15, which can be achieved by buying two yogurts at the promotion price of 9 and one yogurt at the regular price of 5.

The program should be modified to handle the case where the number of yogurts to buy is odd, and to calculate the minimum cost accordingly.
