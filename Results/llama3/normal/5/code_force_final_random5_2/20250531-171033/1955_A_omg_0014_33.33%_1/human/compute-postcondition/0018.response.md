Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), a is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), d is a float equal to half of c, i is 2, stdin contains n-5 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

Explanation: The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers n, a, and b. It then assigns these values to the variables a, b, and c, respectively. The value of d is calculated as half of c. The values of n and i remain unchanged. The stdin now contains n-5 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b.
