The code prints the product of `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `b` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive). Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the product. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `a` and `b`.

Output: **a * b (where a is an integer between 1 and 100 and b is an integer between 1 and 30)**
