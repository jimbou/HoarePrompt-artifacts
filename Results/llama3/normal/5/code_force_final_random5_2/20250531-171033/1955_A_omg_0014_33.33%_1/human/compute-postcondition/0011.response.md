Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), a is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), d is a float equal to half of c, i is 1, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

The code block reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers n, a, and b. It then assigns these values to the variables a, b, and c, respectively. The value of c is then used to calculate the value of d, which is half of c. The variable i remains unchanged. The code does not affect the value of n or the remaining lines in stdin.
