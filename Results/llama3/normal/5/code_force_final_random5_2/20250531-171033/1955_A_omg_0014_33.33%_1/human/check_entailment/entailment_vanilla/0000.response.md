Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program provided attempts to solve this problem by comparing the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) with the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), where d is half the price of the promotion (c / 2).

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program does not handle the case where n is odd. In this case, Maxim cannot buy all yogurts at the promotion price, and the program should calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

2. The program uses the round function to round the result of a * d to the nearest integer. This is not necessary, as the result of a * d is already an integer (since a and d are both integers).

3. The program does not handle the case where a * b is equal to a * d. In this case, the program should print a * b, not a * d.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a % 2 == 0:
            if a * b < a * d:
                print(a * b)
            else:
                print(a * d)
        else:
            if (a - 1) * b + b < (a - 1) * d + b:
                print((a - 1) * b + b)
            else:
                print((a - 1) * d + b)

Correctness: **False**
