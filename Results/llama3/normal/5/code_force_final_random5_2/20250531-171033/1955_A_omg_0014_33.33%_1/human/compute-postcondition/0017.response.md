State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), a is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), d is a float equal to half of c, i is 2, stdin contains n-4 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If the product of a and b is less than the product of a and d, the product of a and b is printed. Otherwise, the rounded value of a times d is printed.**
