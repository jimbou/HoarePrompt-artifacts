This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where each line contains three integers. For each line, it calculates the product of the first two integers and compares it to the product of the first integer and half of the third integer. Depending on the comparison result, it prints either the product of the first two integers or the rounded value of the product of the first integer and half of the third integer. The function processes a specified number of input lines, as indicated by the first integer read from standard input.
