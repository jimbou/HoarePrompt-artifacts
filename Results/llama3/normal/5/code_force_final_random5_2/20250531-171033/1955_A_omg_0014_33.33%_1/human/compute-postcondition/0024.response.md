Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), a is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), d is a float equal to half of c, i is n-1, stdin is empty. If the product of a and b is less than the product of a and d, then the product of a and b is printed. Otherwise, the rounded value of a times d is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still integers between 1 and 30 (inclusive), as they are read from stdin and do not change.
- The value of `d` is still a float equal to half of `c`, as it is calculated inside the loop.
- The value of `i` is now `n-1`, as the loop iterates `n` times and `i` starts at 0.
- Stdin is empty, as all lines have been read and processed by the loop.
- The loop prints the product of `a` and `b` if it is less than the product of `a` and `d`, otherwise it prints the rounded value of `a` times `d`.
