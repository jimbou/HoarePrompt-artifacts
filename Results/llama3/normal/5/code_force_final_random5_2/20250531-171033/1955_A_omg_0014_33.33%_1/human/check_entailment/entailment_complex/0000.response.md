Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program reads a series of input lines from standard input, where each line contains three integers: n, a, and b. For each line, it calculates the product of a and b (the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price) and compares it to the product of a and half of b (the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price). Depending on the comparison result, it prints either the product of a and b or the rounded value of the product of a and half of b.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is comparing the product of a and b with the product of a and half of b, but it should be comparing the product of a and b with the product of a and the minimum of b and 2a. This is because the promotion price is only beneficial if it is less than or equal to the regular price of two yogurts.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
