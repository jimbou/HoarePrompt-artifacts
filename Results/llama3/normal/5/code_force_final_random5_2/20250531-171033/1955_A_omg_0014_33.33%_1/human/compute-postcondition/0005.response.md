The code prints the product of `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `b` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive). The current value of `a` times `b` is less than `a` times `d`, where `d` is a float equal to half of `c`, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).

Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), a is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), c is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), d is a float equal to half of c, i is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). The current value of a times b is less than a times d, and the product of a and b which is less than a times d is being printed**
