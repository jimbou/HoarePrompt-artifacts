Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

The program then calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) and the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), where d is half of the promotion price (b / 2). The program then compares these two costs and prints the minimum cost.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price as a * b, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be a * n, where n is the number of yogurts.

Moreover, the program uses the rounded value of the product of the first integer and half of the third integer, which is not necessary and may lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
