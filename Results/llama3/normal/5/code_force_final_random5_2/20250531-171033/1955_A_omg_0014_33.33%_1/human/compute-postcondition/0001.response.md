According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). So for the loop to be executed `n` is at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `i` is 0**
