Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower. The given program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise prints "No".

The reasoning behind this is that if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it's possible to add `m` cubes in `m` moves, and then remove `n-m` cubes in the remaining `n-m` moves, resulting in a tower with exactly `m` cubes. If `n` is less than `m`, it's not possible to add `m` cubes in `n` moves, so the program prints "No".

The program correctly implements this logic and handles all possible input cases.

Correctness: **True**
