Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program's logic is based on the condition that if n (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to m (the number of cubes), then it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes. This is because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower m times, and then remove the remaining (n-m) cubes.

However, the program does not consider the case where n is odd and m is even, or vice versa. In such cases, it's not possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes, because Nikita can only add or remove 1 cube at a time, and the parity of the number of cubes will always remain the same.

Therefore, the program's logic is incomplete, and it will produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
