Functionality: **This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function modifies the state of the program by consuming two integers from standard input and printing a result, leaving the remaining input unchanged.**
