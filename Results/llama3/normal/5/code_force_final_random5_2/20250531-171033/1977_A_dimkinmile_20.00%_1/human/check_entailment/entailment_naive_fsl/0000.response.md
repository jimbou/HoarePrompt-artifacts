Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the condition `if n >= m:`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

A counterexample is when `n` is even and `m` is odd. In this case, no matter how many times Nikita puts or removes a cube, the tower will always have an even number of cubes, so it's impossible to have a tower with an odd number of cubes.

For example, if `n = 4` and `m = 3`, the program will print "Yes", but it's actually "No" because Nikita can't have a tower with 3 cubes after 4 moves.

To correctly solve the problem, the condition should be `if (n - m) % 2 == 0:`. This checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
