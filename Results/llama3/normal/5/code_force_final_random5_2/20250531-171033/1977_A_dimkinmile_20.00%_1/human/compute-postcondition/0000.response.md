Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be the first two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin now contains one less line, with t-1 lines remaining, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).
