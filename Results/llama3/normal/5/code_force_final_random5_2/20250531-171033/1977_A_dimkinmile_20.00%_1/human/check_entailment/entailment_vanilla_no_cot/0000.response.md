Correctness: **False** 

The given program is incorrect. The condition `if n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct condition should be `if (n - m) % 2 == 0`, because Nikita can only end up with `m` cubes if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because he can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of cubes must change by an even number.
