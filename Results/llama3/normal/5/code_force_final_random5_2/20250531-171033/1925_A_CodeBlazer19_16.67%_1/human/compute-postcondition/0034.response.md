Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, s is an empty string, j is k + 96, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26).**

Explanation:
The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since `n` and `k` were already defined in the initial state, their values are updated. The second line assigns an empty string to `s`, overwriting its previous value. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of lines in stdin is reduced by 1 as one line is read. The rest of the variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
