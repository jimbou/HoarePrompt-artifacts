Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first line of input to `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive).
2. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function.

Now, let's calculate the output state:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), assigned from the first line of input.
* The stdin contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed, so there are `t-1` lines remaining.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26).**
