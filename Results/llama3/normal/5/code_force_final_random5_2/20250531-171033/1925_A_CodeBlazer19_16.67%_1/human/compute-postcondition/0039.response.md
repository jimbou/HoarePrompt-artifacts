The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 97`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 98, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 99, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 3 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `s` is a string containing two lowercase letters 'a' and 'b', `j` is 99, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26)**
