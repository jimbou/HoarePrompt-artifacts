Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`, `j` is `k + 96`, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26). If `k` is 1, a string containing `n` repetitions of the character `s` is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, a string that is either equal to `s` (if `n` is not 1) or equal to `s` repeated twice (if `n` is 1) is printed.***
