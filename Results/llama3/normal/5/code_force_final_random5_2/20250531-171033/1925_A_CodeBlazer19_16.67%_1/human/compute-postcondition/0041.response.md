Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to the letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `k + 96`, `j` is `k + 96`, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26)**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the string `s` will contain all lowercase letters from 'a' up to the letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `k + 96`. The value of `j` will be `k + 96`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
