To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0 and `j` is within the range of 97 to `k + 97`.

Since `j` is initialized as `k + 96`, we need to adjust `k` to be at least 1 to ensure `j` is within the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 97, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**
