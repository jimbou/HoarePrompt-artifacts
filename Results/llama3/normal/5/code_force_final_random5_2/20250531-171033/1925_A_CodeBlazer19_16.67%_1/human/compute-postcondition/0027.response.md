The `print(n * s)` statement will print a string that is the result of repeating the string `s` `n` times.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), and `s` is a string containing 1 character from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value 97, the output will be a string of `n` repetitions of a single character between 'a' and 'a' (which is just 'a').

Output: **a string of n repetitions of 'a' (where n is an integer between 1 and 26)**
