The code prints the string `s` repeated `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), and `s` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

Output: **n repetitions of the string s (where n is an integer between 1 and 26 and s is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z')**
