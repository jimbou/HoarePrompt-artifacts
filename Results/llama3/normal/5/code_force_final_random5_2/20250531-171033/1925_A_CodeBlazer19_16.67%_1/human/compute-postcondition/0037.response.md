The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and k. If j is less than k + 97, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 97, k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time j must be 98 and k must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string containing one lowercase letter 'a', `j` is 98, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26)**
