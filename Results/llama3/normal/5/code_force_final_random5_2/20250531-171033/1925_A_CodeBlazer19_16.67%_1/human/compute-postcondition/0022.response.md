Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing two characters 'ab', `j` is 98, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 98, the character 'b' is appended to `s`, resulting in `s` containing two characters 'ab'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
