To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `k`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

Since `j` is initialized to `k + 96` before the loop, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be within the range of the loop, which is from 97 to `k + 97`. Therefore, we can set `j` to be 97.

The state of `k` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1, as it is the condition for the loop to execute.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and the contents of `stdin` do not affect the execution of the loop, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 97, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26)**
