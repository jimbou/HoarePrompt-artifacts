Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing a single character 'a', `j` is 97, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain a single character 'a', which is the result of `chr(j)` where `j` is 97, the ASCII value of 'a'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
