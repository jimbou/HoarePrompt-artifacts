Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''
    for j in range(97, k + 97):
        s += chr(j)
    if k == 1:
        print(n * s)
    else:
        print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing `k` lowercase letters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet, `j` is `k + 96` and stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26). If `k` is 1, a string of `n` lowercase letters 'a' is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, either `s` or 2 * `s` is printed, depending on whether `n` is 1 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`, `j` is `k + 96`, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26). If `k` is 1, a string containing `n` repetitions of the character `s` is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, a string that is either equal to `s` (if `n` is not 1) or equal to `s` repeated twice (if `n` is 1) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to the letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `k + 96`, `j` is `k + 96`, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26). If `k` is 1, a string consisting of 'a' repeated n times is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, either `s` or `s` repeated twice is printed depending on the value of `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
