Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing one lowercase letter 'a', `j` is 97, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26)**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain one lowercase letter 'a' because `chr(j)` returns the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer `j`, which is 97, the Unicode code point for 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
