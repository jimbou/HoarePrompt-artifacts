Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 2 and k = 3, the program outputs "abcbac", but this string does not contain all possible substrings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets. The correct output should be "abcabc".
