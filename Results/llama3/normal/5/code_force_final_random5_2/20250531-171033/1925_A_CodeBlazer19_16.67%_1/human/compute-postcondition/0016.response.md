Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing `k` lowercase letters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet, `j` is `k + 96` and stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26). If `k` is 1, a string of `n` lowercase letters 'a' is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, either `s` or 2 * `s` is printed, depending on whether `n` is 1 or not.**
