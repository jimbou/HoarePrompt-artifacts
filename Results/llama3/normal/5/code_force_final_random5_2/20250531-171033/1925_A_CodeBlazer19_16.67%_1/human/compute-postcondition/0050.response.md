Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, and prints a string of lowercase letters from 'a' to the k-th letter of the alphabet. If k is 1, it prints n repetitions of the letter 'a'. If k is greater than 1, it prints either one or two repetitions of the string, depending on whether n is 1 or not. After processing all test cases, stdin is empty.**
