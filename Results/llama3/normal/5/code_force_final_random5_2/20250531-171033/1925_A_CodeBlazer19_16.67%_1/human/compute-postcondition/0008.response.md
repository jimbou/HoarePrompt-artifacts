Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing three lowercase letters 'a', 'b', and 'c', `j` is 99 and stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 99, the character appended is 'c'. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
