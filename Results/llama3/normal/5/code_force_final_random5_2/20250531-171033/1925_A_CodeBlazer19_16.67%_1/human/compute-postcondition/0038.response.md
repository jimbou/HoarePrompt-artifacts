Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string containing two lowercase letters 'a' and 'b', `j` is 98, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26)**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 98, the character 'b' is appended to `s`, resulting in a string containing two lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
