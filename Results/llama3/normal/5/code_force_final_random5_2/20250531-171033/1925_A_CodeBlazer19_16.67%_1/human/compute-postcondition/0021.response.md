To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 97, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 98. The value of `k` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing a single character 'a', `j` is 98, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**
