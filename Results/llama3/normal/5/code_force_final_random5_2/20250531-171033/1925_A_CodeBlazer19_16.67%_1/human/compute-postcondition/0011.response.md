The code prints the product of `n` and `s`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and `s` is a string containing 1 lowercase letter from 'a' to the 1st letter of the alphabet, the output will be a string containing `n` repetitions of the letter 'a'.
Output: **a repeated n times (where n is an integer between 1 and 26)**
