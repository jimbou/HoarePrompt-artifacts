Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), s is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26)**

Explanation:
The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `t` is between 1 and 676 (inclusive), and `t-1` lines of input are provided, this line will read the first line of input. The values of `n` and `k` will be between 1 and 26 (inclusive). The second line initializes an empty string `s`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `t` also remains unchanged. The stdin will now contain `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
