Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing `k` lowercase letters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet, `j` is `k + 96` and stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the string `s` will contain `k` consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a' and ending at the `k`-th letter of the alphabet. The variable `j` will be equal to `k + 96`, which is the ASCII value of the `k`-th letter of the alphabet plus 1. The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
