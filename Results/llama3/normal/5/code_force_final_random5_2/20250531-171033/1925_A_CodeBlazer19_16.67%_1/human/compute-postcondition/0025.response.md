Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`, `j` is `k + 96`, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the string `s` containing `k` characters starting from 'a' up to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`. The variable `j` will be equal to `k + 96`, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
