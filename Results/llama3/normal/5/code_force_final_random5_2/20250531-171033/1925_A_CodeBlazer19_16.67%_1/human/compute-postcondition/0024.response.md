Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string containing three characters 'abc', `j` is 99, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to 'abc' by appending the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 99) to the original string 'ab'. The other variables remain unchanged.
