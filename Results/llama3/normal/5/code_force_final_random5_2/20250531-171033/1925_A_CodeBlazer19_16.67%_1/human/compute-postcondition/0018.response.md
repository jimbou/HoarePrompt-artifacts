Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, s is an empty string, j is k + 96 and stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26).**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `k`, and then assigns an empty string to `s`. The value of `j` is not modified, but its value is still dependent on the new value of `k`. The input state is also modified, as two integers are read from the input, leaving `t-3` lines of input remaining.
