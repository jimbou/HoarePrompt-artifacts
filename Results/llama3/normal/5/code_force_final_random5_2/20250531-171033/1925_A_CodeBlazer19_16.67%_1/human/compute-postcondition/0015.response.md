The code prints a string that is either equal to `s` or equal to `2 * s`, depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, the string printed is equal to `s`, otherwise the string printed is equal to `2 * s`. Where `s` is a string containing `k` lowercase letters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing `k` lowercase letters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet, `j` is `k + 96` and stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), and this is printed: either s or 2 * s depending on whether n is 1 or not**
