The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
