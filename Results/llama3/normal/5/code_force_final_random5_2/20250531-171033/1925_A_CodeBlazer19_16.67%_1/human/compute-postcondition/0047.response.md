The code prints a string that is either equal to `s` or equal to `s` repeated twice, depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, the string `s` is printed once. If `n` is greater than 1, the string `s` is printed twice.

Since `s` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to the letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `k + 96`, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive), the string `s` will contain a subset of the lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to the letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `k + 96`, `j` is `k + 96`, and stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 26), and this is printed: either s or s repeated twice depending on the value of n.**
