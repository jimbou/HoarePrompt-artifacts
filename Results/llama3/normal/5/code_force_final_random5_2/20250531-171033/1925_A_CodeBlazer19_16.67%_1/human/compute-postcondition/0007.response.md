To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `k + 97`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 98. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 99. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and the contents of `stdin` are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing two lowercase letters 'a' and 'b', `j` is 99 and stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**
