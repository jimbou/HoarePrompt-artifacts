Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `s` is a string containing two lowercase letters 'a' and 'b', `j` is 98 and stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the character 'b' (which is the ASCII character corresponding to the integer value 98) in addition to the original character 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-2` lines of input, each with two integers `n` and `k`.
