Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the element at index i in list a, y is the first digit of the element at index i in list a, n is either 1 or 2, c is a list containing either the element at index i in list a or y and x, stdin is empty, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is such that the element at index i in list a is greater than 10. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2, c contains y and x, and y is less than or equal to the last element in list c (x). If y is greater than x, then n is 1, c contains the element at index i in list a, and y is greater than or equal to the last element in list c.***
