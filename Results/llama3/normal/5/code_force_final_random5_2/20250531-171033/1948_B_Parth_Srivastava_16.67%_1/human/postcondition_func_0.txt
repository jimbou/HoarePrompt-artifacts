This function reads an integer k and k test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It processes these integers by splitting two-digit numbers into their first and last digits, unless the first digit is greater than the last digit, in which case it leaves the number intact. The function then checks if the resulting list of numbers is sorted in ascending order. If it is, the function appends 1 to a list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function repeats this process for all k test cases.
