Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, i is increased by 1. If i is 0 and the element at index i in list a is greater than 10, then x is the last digit of the element at index i in list a, y is the first digit of the element at index i in list a, n is either 2, 3, or 4, and c is a list containing either the element at index i in list a, y, and x or y and x. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 2 or 4, c contains y and x, and y is less than or equal to the last element in list c (x). If y is greater than x, then n is either 1 or 3, c contains the element at index i in list a, y, and x, and y is greater than or equal to the last element in list c (x). If i is not 0 or the element at index i in list a is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is either 1 or 3, and c is a list containing the value of a[i], y, and x. Otherwise, c is a list containing either the element at index i in list a or y and x, and n is either 2 or 3.***
