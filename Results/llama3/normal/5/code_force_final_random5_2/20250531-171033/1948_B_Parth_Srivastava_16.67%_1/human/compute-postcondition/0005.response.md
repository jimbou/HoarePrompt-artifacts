Postcondition: **k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the element at index i in list a, y is the first digit of the element at index i in list a, n is 0, c is an empty list, stdin is empty, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is such that the element at index i in list a is greater than 10. The current value of y is greater than or equal to the last element in list c. Additionally, the first digit of the element at index i in list a (y) is less than or equal to the last digit of the element at index i in list a (x).**
