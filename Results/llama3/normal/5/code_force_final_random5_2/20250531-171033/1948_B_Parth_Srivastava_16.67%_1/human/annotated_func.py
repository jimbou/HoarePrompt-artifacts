#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).

    #State: *`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the length of list `a`, `c` is a list containing either the elements of list `a` or the first and last digits of the elements of list `a` in the order they appear in list `a`, `d` is a sorted list containing either the elements of list `a` or the first and last digits of the elements of list `a` in the order they appear in list `a`. If `c` is equal to `d`, then `b` is a list containing the integer 1. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element 0 appended to it.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer k and k test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It processes these integers by splitting two-digit numbers into their first and last digits, unless the first digit is greater than the last digit, in which case it leaves the number intact. The function then checks if the resulting list of numbers is sorted in ascending order. If it is, the function appends 1 to a list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function repeats this process for all k test cases.
