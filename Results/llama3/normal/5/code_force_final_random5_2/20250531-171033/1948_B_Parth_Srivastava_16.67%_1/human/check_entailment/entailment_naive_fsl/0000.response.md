Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the input array contains a number that is greater than 99. In this case, the program will not correctly split the number into its digits and will not correctly check if the resulting array is sorted.

For example, if the input array is [100, 2, 3], the program will not correctly split the number 100 into its digits 1, 0, and 0, and will not correctly check if the resulting array [1, 0, 0, 2, 3] is sorted.

The program assumes that all numbers in the input array are between 0 and 99, but the problem description does not make this assumption. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.
