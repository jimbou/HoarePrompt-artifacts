Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers, x is 0, y is 0, n is 0, c is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `stdin` is empty. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, then `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in list `a`, `y` is the first digit of the element at index `i` in list `a`, `n` is either 1 or 2, and `c` is a list containing either the element at index `i` in list `a` or `y` and `x`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then `n` is 2, `c` contains `y` and `x`, and `y` is less than or equal to the last element in list `c` (`x`). If `y` is greater than `x`, then `n` is 1, `c` contains the element at index `i` in list `a`, and `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in list `c`. If `i` is 0 and the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than 10, then `x` is a single digit between 0 and 9, `y` is a single digit between 1 and 9. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then `n` is 2, and `c` is a list containing the values of `y` and `x` in that order. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `n` is 1, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i` is not 0 or the element at index `i` in list `a` is less than or equal to 10, then `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 1, and `c` is a list containing the value of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, stdin is empty. If the element at index i in list a is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of the element at index i in list a, y is the first digit of the element at index i in list a, n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, and c is a list containing either the element at index i in list a or y and x. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 3 or 4, c contains y and x, and y is less than or equal to the last element in list c (x). If y is greater than x, then n is either 1 or 2, c contains the element at index i in list a, and y is greater than or equal to the last element in list c. If i is 0 and the element at index i in list a is greater than 10, then x is a single digit between 0 and 9, y is a single digit between 1 and 9. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2, and c is a list containing the values of y and x in that order. If y is greater than x, then n is 1, and c is a list containing the first element of a. If i is not 0 or the element at index i in list a is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, and c is a list containing the value of a[i]. i is increased by 1. If y is greater than or equal to the last element in list c, then n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, and c is a list containing either the element at index i in list a or y and x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, i is increased by 1. If i is 0 and the element at index i in list a is greater than 10, then x is the last digit of the element at index i in list a, y is the first digit of the element at index i in list a. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 3, 4, 5 or 6, and c is a list containing y and x. If y is greater than x, then n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, and c is a list containing the first element of a. If i is not 0 or the element at index i in list a is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, and n is either 1, 2 or 3. If a[i] > 10 and i > 0, then x is the last digit of the element at index i in list a, y is the first digit of the element at index i in list a. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 4, 5, 6, and c contains y, x, y and x. If y is greater than x, then n is either 2, 3, 4, and c contains the element at index i in list a, y and x. If y is greater than or equal to the last element in list c, then n is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, and c is a list containing either the element at index i in list a or y and x. Otherwise, c is a list containing either the element at index i in list a or y and x, and an additional element from list a, n is either 2, 3, 4 or 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
