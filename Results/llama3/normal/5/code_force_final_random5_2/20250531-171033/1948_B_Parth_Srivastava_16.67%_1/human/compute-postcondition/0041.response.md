Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, i is increased by 1, x is the last digit of the element at index i in list a, y is the first digit of the element at index i in list a. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 4, 5, 6, c contains y, x, y and x, and y is less than or equal to the last element in list c (x). If y is greater than x, then n is either 2, 3, 4, c contains the element at index i in list a, y and x, and y is greater than or equal to the last element in list c. If i is 0 and the element at index i in list a is greater than 10, then x is a single digit between 0 and 9, y is a single digit between 1 and 9. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 4 or 6, and c is a list containing the values of y, x, y and x in that order. If y is greater than x, then n is either 2 or 4, and c is a list containing the first element of a, y and x. If i is not 0 or the element at index i in list a is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is either 2 or 3, and c is a list containing the value of a[i], y and x. If y is greater than or equal to the last element in list c, then n is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and c is a list containing either the element at index i in list a or y and x.***
