Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the length of list `a`, `c` is a list containing either the elements of list `a` or the first and last digits of the elements of list `a` in the order they appear in list `a`, `d` is a sorted list containing either the elements of list `a` or the first and last digits of the elements of list `a` in the order they appear in list `a`. If `c` is equal to `d`, then `b` is a list containing the integer 1. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element 0 appended to it.***
