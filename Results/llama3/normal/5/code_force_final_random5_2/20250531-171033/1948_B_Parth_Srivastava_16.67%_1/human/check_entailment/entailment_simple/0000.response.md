Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the elements of each array.
2. The program correctly checks if each element in the array is greater than 10 and if it is, it splits the element into its digits and checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. If they are, it adds the digits to the list `c`. If not, it adds the original element to the list `c`.
3. The program correctly handles the case where the first element of the array is greater than 10.
4. The program correctly checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it appends 0 to the list `b`.
5. The program correctly prints the result for each test case, printing "YES" if the array can be sorted and "NO" otherwise.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and there are no errors in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
