Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the problem description and correctly determines whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the specified operation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `m` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
3.  It then processes the array by splitting two-digit numbers into their first and last digits, unless the first digit is greater than the last digit, in which case it leaves the number intact. This is done using the `if` and `elif` statements inside the `for` loop.
4.  After processing the array, it checks if the resulting list of numbers is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.
5.  Finally, it prints 'YES' if the corresponding value in `b` is 1 and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the array is already sorted, when it can be sorted by splitting two-digit numbers, and when it cannot be sorted.

Correctness: **True**
