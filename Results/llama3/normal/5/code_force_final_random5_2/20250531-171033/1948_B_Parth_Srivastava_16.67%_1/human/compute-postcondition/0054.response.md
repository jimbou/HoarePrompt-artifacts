Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the length of list `a`, `c` is a list containing either the elements of list `a` or the first and last digits of the elements of list `a` in the order they appear in list `a`, `d` is a sorted list containing either the elements of list `a` or the first and last digits of the elements of list `a` in the order they appear in list `a`, `c` and `d` are not equal, and `b` has an additional element 0 appended to it.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `b` now has an additional element 0 appended to it.
