Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers with at least 1 element, stdin is empty, i is 0. If i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then x is a single digit between 0 and 9, y is a single digit between 1 and 9. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2, and c is a list containing the values of y and x in that order. If y is greater than x, then n is 1, and c is a list containing the first element of a. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, and c is a list containing the value of a[i].***
