Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times. The program takes the number of test cases as input, followed by the number of elements in the array and the array itself.

The program defines a helper function `func_1` that checks if the input list is sorted in non-descending order. The main program iterates over the array, and for each element, it checks if the array is not sorted and if the current element is greater than the next element and is greater than 10. If these conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them into the array.

After iterating over the entire array, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function. If it is, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and is greater than 10, and if so, it splits the current element into its digits. But it does not consider the case where the current element is less than or equal to the next element, but the next element is greater than 10 and can be split into its digits to make the array sorted.

For example, consider the input array [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into its digits, resulting in the array [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. However, it will not split the third element into its digits, resulting in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
