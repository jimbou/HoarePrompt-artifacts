Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the third element (45) into [4, 5], which is also a valid operation according to the problem description. As a result, the program will incorrectly print "NO" instead of "YES".

The issue is that the program only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10, and if so, it splits the previous element. However, it does not recursively check if the resulting elements can be further split. A correct solution would need to handle this recursive splitting correctly.
