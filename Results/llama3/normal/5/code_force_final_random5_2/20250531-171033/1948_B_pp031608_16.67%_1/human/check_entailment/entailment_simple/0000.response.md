Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The program iterates through the array and checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them into the array. The program then checks if the array is sorted after this operation. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The program also handles the case where the array is already sorted.

Correctness: **True**
