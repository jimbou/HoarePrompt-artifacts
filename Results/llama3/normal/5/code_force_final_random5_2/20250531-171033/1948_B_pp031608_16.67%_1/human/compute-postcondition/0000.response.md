Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, which is a sorted version of `lst`.**

In this output state, the list `lst` remains unchanged, and a new variable `sorted_lst` is created, which is a sorted version of `lst` in ascending order. The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list and leaves the original list unchanged.
