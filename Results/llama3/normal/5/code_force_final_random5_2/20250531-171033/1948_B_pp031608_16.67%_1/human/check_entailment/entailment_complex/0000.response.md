Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the operation of deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if a list is sorted in ascending order. The main part of the program iterates over the input list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. If both conditions are true, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them into the list.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. It does not consider the case where the current element is less than or equal to the next element, but the next element is greater than 10. In this case, the program should also split the next element into its digits.

Moreover, the program only splits the current element into its digits and inserts them into the list. It does not check if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order after the split operation.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
