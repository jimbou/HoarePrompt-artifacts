Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `N`, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the digits of all integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using the `func_1` function.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The problem statement asks for the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, but the program calculates the sum of the digits of all integers from 0 to `n`, not from 1 to `n`. This means that the program is including the sum of the digits of 0 in the calculation, which is not part of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
