Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code. Although its functionality is described in the comments, it is not clear if it is correctly implemented.
2. The variable `soma` is initialized to 0, but it is not clear if it is being used correctly. The program is adding the result of `func_1(i)` to `soma` in each iteration of the loop, but it is not clear if this is the correct approach to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board.
3. The program is printing the final value of `soma`, but it is not clear if this is the correct output. The problem statement asks for the sum of the numbers on the board after the replacement, but it is not clear if the program is correctly calculating this sum.

Despite these issues, the program is close to being correct. If the function `func_1` is correctly implemented and the variable `soma` is being used correctly, the program should produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False** (due to the issues mentioned above)

Note: If the function `func_1` is correctly implemented and the variable `soma` is being used correctly, the correctness would be **True**.
