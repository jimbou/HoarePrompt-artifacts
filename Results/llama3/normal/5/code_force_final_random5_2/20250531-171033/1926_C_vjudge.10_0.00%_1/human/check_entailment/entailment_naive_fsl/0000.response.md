Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the given problem description. The problem description states that Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n, inclusive, on the board, but the program starts the sum from 0, not 1. This means that the program is missing the sum of the digits of the number 1, which is 1.

For example, if n=1, the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 1.

To fix this issue, the program should start the sum from 1, not 0. The corrected code should be:

```python
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
```

This corrected code will start the sum from 1 and include the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n, inclusive.
