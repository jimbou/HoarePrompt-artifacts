Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine who will win the game if they both play optimally. The program only checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even, but this is not sufficient to determine the winner.

A counterexample is when the input is "4" and the string is "UDUD". In this case, the program will output "NO", but Alice can actually win the game by choosing the first coin, flipping the second and third coins, and then choosing the third coin, leaving Bob with no moves.

The correct solution would involve a more complex analysis of the game state, taking into account the arrangement of 'U's and 'D's, and determining the optimal moves for each player.
