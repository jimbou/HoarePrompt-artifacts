Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to the number of test cases, index is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D"
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    s = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    count_u = s.count('U')
    if count_u % 2 == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, index is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", count_u is the number of 'U' characters in s. If count_u is odd, 'YES' is printed. If count_u is even, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 0, index is 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", count_u is the number of 'U' characters in s. If count_u is odd, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 6, index is 7, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", count_u is the number of 'U' characters in s. If count_u is odd, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
