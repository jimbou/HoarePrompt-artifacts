The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 5, t is at least 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 6 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 5.
State: **t is at least 6, index is 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", count_u is the number of 'U' characters in s. If count_u is odd, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.**
