Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins and the string representing the coins. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string and checks if the count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it prints 'YES', indicating that Alice will win the game. If the count is even, it prints 'NO', indicating that Bob will win the game.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win. The key insight is that if the number of 'U' characters is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of 'U' characters, forcing Bob to lose. On the other hand, if the number of 'U' characters is even, Bob can always make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of 'U' characters, forcing Alice to lose.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
