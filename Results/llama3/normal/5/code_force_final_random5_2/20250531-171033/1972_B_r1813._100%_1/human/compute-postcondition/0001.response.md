To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D"**
