The code snippet reads the first test case from stdin and processes it. The first line assigns the value of the first line of the test case, which is a positive integer n, to the variable `n`. The second line assigns the value of the second line of the test case, which is a string s of length n, to the variable `s`. The third line increments the `index` by 2, effectively moving to the next test case in stdin. The fourth line assigns the count of 'U' characters in the string s to the variable `count_u`.

Output State: **t is at least 1, index is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", count_u is the number of 'U' characters in s**
