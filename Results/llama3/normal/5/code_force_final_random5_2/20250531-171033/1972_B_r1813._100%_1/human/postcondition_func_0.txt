This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only 'U' and 'D' characters. It then determines whether the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd or even and prints 'YES' if it's odd and 'NO' if it's even, for each test case.
