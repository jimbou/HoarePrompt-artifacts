#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D".
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t is 0, index is 2t + 1, stdin contains no test cases, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", count_u is the number of 'U' characters in s. If count_u is odd, 'YES' is printed. If count_u is even, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only 'U' and 'D' characters. It then determines whether the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd or even and prints 'YES' if it's odd and 'NO' if it's even, for each test case.
