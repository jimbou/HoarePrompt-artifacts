The code increments the value of `counter` by 1. The initial value of `counter` is 0, so after the increment, `counter` becomes 1. The values of `num` and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with at least one digit, `counter` is 1, `i` is the last index of `num`, and the last character of `num` is '0'.**
