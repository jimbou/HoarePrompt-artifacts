Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with at least one digit, `i` is -1, and `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `num` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has iterated over all indices of `num` from the last to the first. The variable `counter` will hold the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. If `num` ends with one or more zeros, `counter` will be greater than 0, otherwise, it will remain 0.
