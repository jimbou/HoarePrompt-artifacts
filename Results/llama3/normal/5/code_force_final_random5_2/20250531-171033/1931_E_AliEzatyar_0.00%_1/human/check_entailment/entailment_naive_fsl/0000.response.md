Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The issue lies in the way the program handles the subtraction of zeros. The program subtracts the zeros from the total digits in a way that assumes Anna will always reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros first. However, this is not necessarily the optimal strategy for Anna.

For example, consider the case where the input is `4 5` and the array is `[1000, 1000, 1000, 1000]`. The program will subtract 4 zeros from the total digits, resulting in a total of 16 digits. However, Anna can actually win this game by reversing the numbers in a way that leaves Sasha with a number that has fewer than 10^5 digits.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to take into account the optimal strategy for Anna, which involves reversing the numbers in a way that minimizes the number of digits that Sasha can create. This can be done by using a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the number of trailing zeros in each number and the optimal way to reverse them.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to fix this issue:
```
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += min(zeros[i], zeros[i+1])
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```
This modified program takes into account the optimal strategy for Anna and correctly determines the winner of the game in all cases.
