Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with at least one digit, `i` is the third to last index of `num` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num` and `i` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The `num` variable still holds a string representation of an integer with at least one digit, and the `i` variable still points to the third to last index of `num`. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement, which is indicated by the phrase "we break out of the most internal loop or if statement".
