Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer. This function is used to count the number of zeros that can be removed from the end of each number in the list.
3. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list and the number of zeros that can be removed from the end of each number.
4. The program correctly sorts the list of zeros in descending order and subtracts the number of zeros that can be removed from the end of each number in pairs (i.e., every other number).
5. The program correctly checks if the total number of digits minus the number of zeros that can be removed is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, the program outputs "Sasha", otherwise it outputs "Anna".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
