To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. The loop will execute if `num` has at least one digit, i.e., `len(num)` is greater than 0. Since `num` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be a string representation of an integer with at least one digit. We can also adjust the state of `i` to be the last index of the string representation of `num`.

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with at least one digit, `counter` is 0, `i` is the last index of `num`**
