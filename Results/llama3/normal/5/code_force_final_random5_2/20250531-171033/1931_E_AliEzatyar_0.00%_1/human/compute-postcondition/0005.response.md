Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with at least one digit, `counter` is 0, `i` is the last index of `num`, and the last digit of `num` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The last digit of `num` is still not '0', as this condition was specified in the initial state and the code does not modify `num`. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
