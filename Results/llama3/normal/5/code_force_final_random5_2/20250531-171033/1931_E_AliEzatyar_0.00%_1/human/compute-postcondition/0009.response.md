Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with at least one digit, `i` is the second to last index of `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The `num` variable still holds a string representation of an integer with at least one digit, and `i` still refers to the second to last index of `num`. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement, which is indicated by the additional phrase "and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement".
