Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 3, `i` is 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `ans` contains either 100000000, -100000000, and 99999998, `max` is 99999997, and `min` is -99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and either -99999999 or -99999998, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, and `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so `t` becomes 3. The values of `x`, `i`, `ans`, `max`, and `min` remain the same as they were not affected by the code. The conditions for `x` being even or odd and their corresponding effects on `ans`, `max`, and `min` also remain the same.
