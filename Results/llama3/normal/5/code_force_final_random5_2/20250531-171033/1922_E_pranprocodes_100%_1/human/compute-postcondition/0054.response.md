Output State: **x is an integer equal to half of its original value, t is 0, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, ans is a list containing the value 100000000, i is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been halved due to the integer division by 2, `max` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `max` before the decrement (100000000) has been appended to the list `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `min`, `i`, and `stdin`) remain unchanged.
