Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer other than 1. If x is even, x is halved, max is 99999999, min remains -100000000, ans is a list containing 100000000, and t and i remain 0. If x is odd, x is decremented by 1, min is -99999999, max remains 100000000, ans is a list containing -100000000, and t and i remain 0.***
