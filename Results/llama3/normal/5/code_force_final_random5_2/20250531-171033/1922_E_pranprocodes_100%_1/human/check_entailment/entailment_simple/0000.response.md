Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array. It starts with an empty array and iteratively adds elements to it. If X is even, it adds the maximum possible element (100000000) to the array and divides X by 2. If X is odd, it adds the minimum possible element (-100000000) to the array and decrements X by 1. This process continues until X becomes 1.

The program then reverses the constructed array and prints its length and elements.

The key insight behind this approach is that adding a large element to the array doubles the number of increasing subsequences, while adding a small element increases the number of increasing subsequences by 1. By iteratively adding large and small elements, the program constructs an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

The program's correctness can be argued as follows:

*   The program correctly handles the base case where X is 1. In this case, the array is empty, and there is only one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).
*   When X is even, the program adds a large element to the array and divides X by 2. This is correct because adding a large element doubles the number of increasing subsequences.
*   When X is odd, the program adds a small element to the array and decrements X by 1. This is correct because adding a small element increases the number of increasing subsequences by 1.
*   The program continues this process until X becomes 1, at which point the constructed array has exactly X increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
