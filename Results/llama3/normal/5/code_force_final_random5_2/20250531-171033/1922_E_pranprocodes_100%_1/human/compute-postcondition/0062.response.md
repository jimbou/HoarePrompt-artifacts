Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` contains 100000000 and then 99999998. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains -100000000 and then 99999999. If `x` is odd and the else part is executed, `x` is decreased by 2, `ans` contains 100000000 and min, and min is either -99999999 + 1 or -100000000 + 1 depending on whether `x` was odd or even.***
