Output State: **`x` is a positive integer other than 1, `t` is 1, if `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, and `i` is 0, if `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, and `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with their values depending on whether `x` is even or odd.
