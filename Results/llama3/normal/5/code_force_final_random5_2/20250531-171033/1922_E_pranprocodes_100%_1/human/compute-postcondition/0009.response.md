The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer other than 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time x must still be a positive integer other than 1.
State: **`x` is a positive integer other than 1, `t` is 1, if `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, and `i` is 0, if `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, and `i` is 0**
