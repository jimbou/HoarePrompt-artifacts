Output State: **x is 1, t is a positive integer, max is between -100000000 and 100000000, min is between -100000000 and 100000000, ans is a list containing a sequence of 100000000 and -100000000, and i is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that x is 1, t is a positive integer, max is between -100000000 and 100000000, min is between -100000000 and 100000000, ans is a list containing a sequence of 100000000 and -100000000, and i is 0.
