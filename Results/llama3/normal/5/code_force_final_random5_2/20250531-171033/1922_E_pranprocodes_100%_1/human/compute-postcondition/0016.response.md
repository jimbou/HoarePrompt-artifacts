Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, t is 2, min is -99999999 + 1, ans is a list containing -100000000, -99999999 + 1, and -99999999 + 1, i is 0**

Explanation:

Since x is a positive integer and not equal to 1, we can assume that x is greater than 1. 

The first line appends the value of min to the list ans. Since min is -99999999 + 1, ans becomes a list containing -100000000, -99999999 + 1, and -99999999 + 1.

The second line increments min by 1, making min equal to -99999999 + 2.

The third line decrements x by 1, making x equal to its original value minus 2.

The value of t, max, and i remains unchanged.
