Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer, `t` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998 - 1, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, 99999999, and 99999998, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, then divided by 2, `max` is 99999999 - 1 if `x` is even after decrement, or 100000000 if `x` is odd after decrement, `min` is -100000000 + 1 if `x` is even after decrement, or -99999999 + 1 if `x` is odd after decrement, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, -100000000 + 1, and 99999999 if `x` is even after decrement, or -100000000, -99999999 + 1, and -99999999 + 1 if `x` is odd after decrement, with `max` appended, and `i` is 0.**
