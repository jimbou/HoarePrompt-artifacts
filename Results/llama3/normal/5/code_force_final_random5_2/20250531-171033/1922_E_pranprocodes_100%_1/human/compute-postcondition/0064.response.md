The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer not equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must still be not equal to 1.
State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially.**
