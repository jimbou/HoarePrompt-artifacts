Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `ans` contains the max function, and max is 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` contains the original value of min, and min is increased by 1.***
