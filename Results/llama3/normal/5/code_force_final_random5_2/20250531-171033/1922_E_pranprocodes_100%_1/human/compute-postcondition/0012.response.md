Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `t` is 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and 99999999, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, if `x` is even after the decrement, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 1, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and -100000000 + 1, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd after the decrement, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 + 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and -99999999 + 1, and `i` is 0.***
