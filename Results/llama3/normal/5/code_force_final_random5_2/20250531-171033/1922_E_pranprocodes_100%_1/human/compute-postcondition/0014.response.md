According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer, t is 2. t being 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to x is not equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `t` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and 99999999, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, if `x` is even after the decrement, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 1, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and -100000000 + 1, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd after the decrement, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 + 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and -99999999 + 1, and `i` is 0.**
