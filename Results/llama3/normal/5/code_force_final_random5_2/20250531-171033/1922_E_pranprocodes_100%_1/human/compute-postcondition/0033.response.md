Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `x` is even, then `x` is halved, `max` is updated to 99999999, and `ans` contains 100000000. If `x` is odd, then `x` is decremented by 1, `min` is incremented by 1, and `ans` contains -100000000.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being an integer not equal to 1, `max` being 100000000, `min` being -100000000, `ans` being an empty list, and `i` being 1. The conditional statements regarding the parity of `x` and their effects on `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` still hold true.
