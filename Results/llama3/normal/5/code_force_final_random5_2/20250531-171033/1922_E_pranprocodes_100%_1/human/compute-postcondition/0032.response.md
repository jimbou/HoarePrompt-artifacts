Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `x` is even, then `x` is halved, `max` is updated to 99999999, and `ans` contains 100000000. If `x` is odd, then `x` is decremented by 1, `min` is incremented by 1, and `ans` contains -100000000.***
