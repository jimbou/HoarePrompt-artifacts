Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array by repeatedly dividing X by 2 if it's even or subtracting 1 if it's odd, and appending either 100000000 or -100000000 to the array based on whether X is even or odd.

The program correctly handles the base case where X is 1, as it simply prints the length of the array (which is 0) and an empty array.

The program also correctly handles the case where X is even, as it appends 100000000 to the array and divides X by 2. This is because an even X can be divided into two equal parts, and appending 100000000 to the array ensures that the resulting array has exactly X/2 increasing subsequences.

The program also correctly handles the case where X is odd, as it appends -100000000 to the array and subtracts 1 from X. This is because an odd X can be divided into two parts, one of which is one less than the other, and appending -100000000 to the array ensures that the resulting array has exactly (X-1)/2 increasing subsequences.

The program correctly prints the length of the array and the array itself in reverse order, as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
