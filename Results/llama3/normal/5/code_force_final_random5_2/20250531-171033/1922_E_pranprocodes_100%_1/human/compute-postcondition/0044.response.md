Output State: **x is 1, t is the number of times the loop executes, max is 100000000 - the number of times the loop executes, min is -100000000 + the number of times the loop executes, ans is a list of 100000000 and -100000000, i is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that x is 1, t is the number of times the loop executes, max is 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executes, min is -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executes, ans is a list of 100000000 and -100000000, and i is 1.
