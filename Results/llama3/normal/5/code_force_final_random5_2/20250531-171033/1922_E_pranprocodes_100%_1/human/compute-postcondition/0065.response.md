Output State: **ans contains the max function, max is 1, x is an integer equal to its original value divided by 2, t is 2, i is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially.**

The first line appends the max function to the ans list. The second line decrements the value of max by 1, making it 1. The third line performs integer division of x by 2, resulting in a new value for x. The values of t and i remain unchanged. The state of stdin also remains the same, containing 1 less input than initially.
