Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to half of its original value, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, ans is a list containing 100000000, t is 0, i is 0**

Here's a brief explanation of how the code affects the variables:

* The first line appends the current value of `max` (100000000) to the list `ans`.
* The second line decrements `max` by 1, making it 99999999.
* The third line divides `x` by 2, effectively halving its value. Since `x` was initially even, the result is still an integer.

All other variables (`min`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
