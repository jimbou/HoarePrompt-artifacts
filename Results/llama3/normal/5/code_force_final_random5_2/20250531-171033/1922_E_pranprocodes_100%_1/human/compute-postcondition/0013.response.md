Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `t` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and 99999999, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, if `x` is even after the decrement, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 1, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and -100000000 + 1, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd after the decrement, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 + 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and -99999999 + 1, and `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `x` remains a positive integer. If `x` is even, it is divided by 2, and the values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same as before. If `x` is odd, it is decreased by 1, and the values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` depend on whether `x` is even or odd after the decrement.
