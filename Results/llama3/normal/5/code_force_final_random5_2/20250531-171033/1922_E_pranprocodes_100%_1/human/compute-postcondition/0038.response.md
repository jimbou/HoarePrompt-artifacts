Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, and `min` is -99999999. If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, and `min` is -99999998.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of `x`, `i`, `ans`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged. The conditions for `x` being even or odd still apply, and the corresponding values of `max` and `min` are still valid.
