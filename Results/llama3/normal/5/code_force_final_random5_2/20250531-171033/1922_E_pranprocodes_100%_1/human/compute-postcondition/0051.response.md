Output State: **x is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, i is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially**

Explanation:

* The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was initially 1, it is now replaced by the input value. Stdin now contains one less input than initially.
* The second line assigns the value 100000000 to `max`. Since `max` was initially 100000000 - the number of times the loop executes, it is now set to a fixed value of 100000000.
* The third line assigns the value -100000000 to `min`. Since `min` was initially -100000000 + the number of times the loop executes, it is now set to a fixed value of -100000000.
* The fourth line assigns an empty list to `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a list with -100000000 first and 100000000 second, it is now cleared.
* The fifth line assigns the value 0 to `t`. Since `t` was initially greater than 1, it is now set to 0.
* The variable `i` is not modified by the code, so it remains 2.

Note that the initial values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` are overridden by the code, and the value of `t` is reset to 0. The value of `x` is updated to the input value, and `i` remains unchanged.
