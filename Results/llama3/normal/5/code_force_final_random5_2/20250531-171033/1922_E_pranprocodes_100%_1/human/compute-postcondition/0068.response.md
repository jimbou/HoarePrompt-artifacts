Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `ans` contains the max function, and max is 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` contains the original value of min, and min is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 3. The values of `x`, `i`, and the conditions related to `x` being even or odd remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains 1 less input than initially.
