Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the loop executes, `max` is 100000000 - the number of times the loop executes, `min` is -100000000 + the number of times the loop executes, `ans` is a list containing a sequence of -100000000 and 100000000 in reverse order, and `i` is the number of times the loop executes - 1, and the number of times the loop executes which is `t` is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which is a list containing a sequence of -100000000 and 100000000 in reverse order are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `x` has reached 1, the variable `t` has reached the total number of times the loop executes, the variable `max` has decreased by the number of times the loop executes, the variable `min` has increased by the number of times the loop executes, the list `ans` contains a sequence of -100000000 and 100000000 in reverse order, and the variable `i` has reached the number of times the loop executes minus 1. The number of times the loop executes (`t`) and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed.
