Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a positive integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, t is 0, i is 0
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is a positive integer other than 1, `t` is 1, if `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, and `i` is 0, if `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, and `i` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is a positive integer, `t` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and 99999999, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, if `x` is even after the decrement, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 1, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and -100000000 + 1, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd after the decrement, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 + 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and -99999999 + 1, and `i` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is a positive integer, `t` is 3. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998 - 1, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, 99999999, and 99999998, and `i` is 0. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, then divided by 2, `max` is 99999999 - 1 if `x` is even after decrement, or 100000000 if `x` is odd after decrement, `min` is -100000000 + 1 if `x` is even after decrement, or -99999999 + 1 if `x` is odd after decrement, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, -100000000 + 1, and 99999999 if `x` is even after decrement, or -100000000, -99999999 + 1, and -99999999 + 1 if `x` is odd after decrement, with `max` appended, and `i` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
