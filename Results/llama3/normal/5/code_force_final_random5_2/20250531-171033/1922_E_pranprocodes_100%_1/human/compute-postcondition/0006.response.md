Output State: **x is an even positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, min is -99999999, ans is a list containing -100000000, t is 0, i is 0**

The code first appends the value of min to the list ans. Since min is -100000000, ans becomes a list containing -100000000. The second line increments min by 1, making min equal to -99999999. The third line decrements x by 1, making x an even positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. The values of t and i remain unchanged.
