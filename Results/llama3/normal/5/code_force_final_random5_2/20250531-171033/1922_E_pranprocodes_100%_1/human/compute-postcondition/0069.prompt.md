Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, i is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` contains 100000000. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains -100000000.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` contains 100000000 and then 99999998. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains -100000000 and then 99999999. If `x` is odd and the else part is executed, `x` is decreased by 2, `ans` contains 100000000 and min, and min is either -99999999 + 1 or -100000000 + 1 depending on whether `x` was odd or even.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `ans` contains the max function, and max is 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` contains the original value of min, and min is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
