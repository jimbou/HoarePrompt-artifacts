Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to find an array of integers of length at most 200, such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or report that there is no such array. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array by appending the maximum or minimum possible value to the array based on whether X is even or odd.

The program correctly handles the base case where X is 1, in which case the array is empty. For X greater than 1, the program iteratively appends values to the array, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

The program also correctly handles the constraint that the elements of the array should be in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The variables `max` and `min` are initialized to the maximum and minimum possible values, respectively, and are updated accordingly as the array is constructed.

The program's output is also correct, as it prints the length of the array followed by the array itself. If no such array exists, the program prints -1.

After analyzing the program and considering various potential cases, I could not find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
