The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `ans`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list of 100000000 and -100000000. After reversing the list, the order of the elements will be swapped.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the loop executes, `max` is 100000000 - the number of times the loop executes, `min` is -100000000 + the number of times the loop executes, `ans` is a list with -100000000 first and 100000000 second, `i` is 1.**
