Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` contains 100000000. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains -100000000.***
