Output State: **x is a positive integer and not equal to 1, divided by 2 if it was even or decreased by 1 if it was odd, then divided by 2, t is 2, max is 99999998 - 1 if x was even or 99999999 - 1 if x was odd after decrement, min is -100000000 if x was even or -100000000 + 1 if x was odd after decrement, ans is a list containing 100000000 and 99999999 if x was even or 100000000 and -100000000 + 1 if x was odd after decrement, with max appended, i is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `x` has been modified based on its initial parity. If `x` was even, it was divided by 2. If `x` was odd, it was first decreased by 1, and then the resulting value was divided by 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `max` has been decremented by 1 from its initial value, which was 99999998 if `x` was even or 99999999 if `x` was odd after the decrement. The value of `min` remains unchanged at -100000000 if `x` was even or has been incremented by 1 to -100000000 + 1 if `x` was odd after the decrement. The list `ans` contains the initial values 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was even or 100000000 and -100000000 + 1 if `x` was odd after the decrement, with the updated value of `max` appended to the list. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
