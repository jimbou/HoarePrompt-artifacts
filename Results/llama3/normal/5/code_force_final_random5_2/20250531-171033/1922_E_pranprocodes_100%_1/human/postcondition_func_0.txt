This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents a number X. For each X, the function generates a sequence of numbers by repeatedly dividing X by 2 if it's even or subtracting 1 if it's odd, and appends either 100000000 or -100000000 to a list based on whether X is even or odd. The function then prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself in reverse order.
