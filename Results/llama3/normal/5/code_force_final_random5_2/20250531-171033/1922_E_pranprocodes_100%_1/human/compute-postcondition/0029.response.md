Output State: **x is an integer equal to half of its original value, t is 0, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, ans is a list containing 100000000, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been halved due to the integer division by 2. The value of `max` has been decremented by 1, resulting in 99999999. The list `ans` now contains the original value of `max`, which is 100000000. All other variables remain unchanged.
