Output State: **x is an integer equal to its original value divided by 2, t is 2, i is 1, ans contains either 100000000, -100000000, and 99999998 if x was even or 99999999 if x was odd, max is either 99999997 if x was even or 99999998 if x was odd, min is either -99999999 if x was even or -99999998 if x was odd.**

The code first appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `ans` will now contain either 100000000, -100000000, and 99999998 if `x` was even or 99999999 if `x` was odd. The second line decrements `max` by 1, making it either 99999997 if `x` was even or 99999998 if `x` was odd. The third line divides `x` by 2, making it an integer equal to its original value divided by 2. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
