The code snippet modifies the values of `ans`, `min`, and `x`. The first line appends the value of `min` to `ans`. Since `min` is -99999999, `ans` now contains either 100000000, -100000000, and -99999999. The second line increments `min` by 1, making it -99999998. The third line decrements `x` by 1, but since `x` is an integer not equal to 1, its new value is still an integer not equal to 1.

Output State: **x is an integer not equal to 1, t is 1, max is 99999999, min is -99999998, ans contains either 100000000, -100000000, and -99999999, i is 1**
