Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines each containing a single integer X (2 <= X <= 10^18).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = []
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(max)
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans.append(min)
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    ans.reverse()
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `max` is between -100000000 and 100000000, `min` is between -100000000 and 100000000, `ans` is a list containing a sequence of -100000000 and 100000000 in reverse order, and `i` is 0, and the elements of the list `ans` which is a list containing a sequence of -100000000 and 100000000 in reverse order is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the loop executes, `max` is 100000000 - the number of times the loop executes, `min` is -100000000 + the number of times the loop executes, `ans` is a list with -100000000 first and 100000000 second, `i` is 1, and the number of times the loop executes which is `t` is being printed, and this is printed: -100000000 100000000

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is 1, `t` is 10, `max` is 99999991, `min` is -99999999, `ans` contains -99999999, 99999992, 99999993, 99999994, 99999995, 99999996, 99999997, 99999998, 99999999, 100000000, and the value of `t` which is 10 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are -99999999, 99999992, 99999993, 99999994, 99999995, 99999996, 99999997, 99999998, 99999999, 100000000 are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
