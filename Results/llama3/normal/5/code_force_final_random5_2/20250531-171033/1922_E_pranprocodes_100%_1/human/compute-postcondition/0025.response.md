The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input value. If `i` is less than the input value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the input value is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`x` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `max` is between -100000000 and 100000000, `min` is between -100000000 and 100000000, `ans` is a list containing a sequence of -100000000 and 100000000 in reverse order, and `i` is 1**
