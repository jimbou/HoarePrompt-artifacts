The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `ans`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list containing a sequence of 100000000 and -100000000. After reversing the list, the order of the elements will be reversed.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `max` is between -100000000 and 100000000, `min` is between -100000000 and 100000000, `ans` is a list containing a sequence of -100000000 and 100000000 in reverse order, and `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state means that the list `ans` now has its elements in reverse order, with -100000000 coming before 100000000, while all other variables remain unchanged.
