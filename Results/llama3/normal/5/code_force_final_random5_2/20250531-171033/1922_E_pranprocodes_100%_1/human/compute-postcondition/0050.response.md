The only variables in the loop head are variable  i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of times the loop executes which is `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`x` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `max` is 100000000 - the number of times the loop executes, `min` is -100000000 + the number of times the loop executes, `ans` is a list with -100000000 first and 100000000 second, `i` is 2**
