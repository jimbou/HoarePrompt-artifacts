According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer not equal to 1. So, `x` needs to be adjusted to be not equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, and `min` is -99999999. If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, and `min` is -99999998.**
