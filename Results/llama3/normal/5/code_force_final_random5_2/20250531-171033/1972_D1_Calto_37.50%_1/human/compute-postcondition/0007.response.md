Output State: **n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, i is m - 1, cnt is the sum of n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1) for i in range(1, m), x is n - ((m - 1) * (m - 1) - (m - 1)), y is (m - 1) * (m - 1)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `i` is now `m - 1`, `cnt` is the sum of `n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for `i` in range(1, `m`), `x` is `n - ((m - 1) * (m - 1) - (m - 1))`, and `y` is `(m - 1) * (m - 1)`.
