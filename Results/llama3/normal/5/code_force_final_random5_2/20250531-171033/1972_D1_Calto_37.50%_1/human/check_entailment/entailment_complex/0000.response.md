Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, which is used in the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 2 calculates the sum of a specific mathematical expression for a range of values from 1 to m. The expression involves the GCD calculated by Function 1. If the sum is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.

The main program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two positive integers n and m. It then calls Function 2 with n and m as arguments and prints the result.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic. Function 1 correctly calculates the GCD, and Function 2 correctly uses the GCD to calculate the sum of the mathematical expression. The main program correctly reads the input and calls Function 2 with the correct arguments.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
