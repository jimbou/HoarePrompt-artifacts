#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is a positive integer and is equal to the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a positive integer that is equal to the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, modifying the input values in the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.

        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, i is m - 1, cnt is the sum of n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1) for i in range(1, m), x is n - ((m - 1) * (m - 1) - (m - 1)), y is (m - 1) * (m - 1)

    #State: *n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, i is m - 1, cnt is the sum of n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1) for i in range(1, m), x is n - ((m - 1) * (m - 1) - (m - 1)), y is (m - 1) * (m - 1), and cnt is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt, which is the sum of n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1) for i in range(1, m), where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, and cnt is not equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the sum of a specific mathematical expression for a range of values from 1 to m, where n and m are positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. If the sum is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.
