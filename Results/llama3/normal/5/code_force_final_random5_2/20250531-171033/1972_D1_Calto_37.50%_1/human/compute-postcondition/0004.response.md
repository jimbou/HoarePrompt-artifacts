Output State: **n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, i is 2, cnt is n + n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1), x is n - (i * i - i), y is i * i**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 2. The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the result of the expression `x // y + (i > 1)` to its original value `n`. Here, `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`, and `y` is updated to `i * i`. The expression `(i > 1)` evaluates to `True` since `i` is 2, which is greater than 1, so it adds 1 to the count. The final value of `cnt` is `n + n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1)`. The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`, and the value of `y` is updated to `i * i`.
