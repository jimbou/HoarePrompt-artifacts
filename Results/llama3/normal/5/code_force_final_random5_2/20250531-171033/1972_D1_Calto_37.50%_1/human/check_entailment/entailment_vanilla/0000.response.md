Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

`func_2` is the main function that calculates the number of valid pairs. It iterates over the range from 1 to m (exclusive) and for each i, it calculates two values: x and y. The value x is calculated as n - (i * i - i), and y is calculated as i * i. The function then increments the count by the integer division of x by y plus 1 if i is greater than 1. If the count remains 0 after the loop, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count.

The program does not explicitly use the gcd function (`func_1`) in the calculation of valid pairs. However, the calculation of x and y in `func_2` seems to be related to the gcd condition in the problem statement.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the program is using a mathematical property to simplify the gcd condition. The condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) can be rewritten as a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b) for some integer k. This can be further simplified to a = k * b * gcd(a, b) - b, which can be rewritten as a = (k * i - 1) * b, where i = gcd(a, b).

The program uses this property to iterate over possible values of i (from 1 to m) and calculates the corresponding values of a that satisfy the condition. The count of valid pairs is then incremented accordingly.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct.
