To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, m):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to increment it by 1 for the loop to execute again.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. We can't adjust the state of `n`, `cnt`, `x`, or `y` because they are not part of the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `m` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `i` is 3, `cnt` is n + n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1), `x` is n - (i * i - i), `y` is i * i**
