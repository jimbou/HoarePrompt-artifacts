The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n and m are positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and cnt is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0**
