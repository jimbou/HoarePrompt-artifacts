Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used anywhere in the program.

`func_2` calculates the sum of a specific mathematical expression for a range of values from 1 to `m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. If the sum is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.

The program uses `func_2` to calculate the result for each test case and prints the result.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `func_2` does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem. The condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` is not directly addressed in the function. Instead, the function calculates a sum of expressions involving `n` and `i`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `m`. This does not seem to be related to the problem's conditions.

Furthermore, the function `func_1` is not used anywhere in the program, which suggests that it might be a leftover from a previous version of the code.

Given these observations, it is likely that the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
