Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem that involves counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The conditions are:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The program uses two functions: `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, and `func_2` to count the number of valid pairs.

In `func_2`, the program iterates over the range from 1 to m-1 and calculates the value of x and y for each i. The value of x is calculated as n - (i * i - i), and the value of y is calculated as i * i. The program then increments the count (cnt) by the integer division of x by y plus 1 if i is greater than 1.

After the loop, the program checks if the count is 0. If it is, the program returns 1. Otherwise, the program returns the count.

The program's logic is based on the mathematical property that the number of valid pairs (a, b) is equal to the sum of the number of pairs (a, b) where b is a divisor of a, and the number of pairs (a, b) where b is not a divisor of a.

The program's use of the gcd function and the calculation of x and y are correct and efficient. The program's logic is also correct, and it handles the edge case where the count is 0.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
