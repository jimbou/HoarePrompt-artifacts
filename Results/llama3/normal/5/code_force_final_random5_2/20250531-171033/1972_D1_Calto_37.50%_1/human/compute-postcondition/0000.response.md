Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were before the code was executed. The code only introduces a new variable `cnt` and assigns it the value 0. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, and the new variable `cnt` with the value 0.
