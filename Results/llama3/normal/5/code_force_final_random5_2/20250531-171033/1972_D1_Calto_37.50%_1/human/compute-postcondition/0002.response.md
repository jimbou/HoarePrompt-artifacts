The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the value of `n - (i * i - i)` to `x`. Since `i` is 1, `i * i - i` equals 0, so `x` becomes equal to `n`. The second line assigns the value of `i * i` to `y`, making `y` equal to 1. The third line increments `cnt` by the integer division of `x` by `y` plus a boolean value `(i > 1)`. Since `x` is `n` and `y` is 1, `x // y` equals `n`. The boolean value `(i > 1)` is False because `i` is 1, so it does not contribute to the increment. Therefore, `cnt` becomes `n`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, i is 1, cnt is n, x is n, y is 1**
