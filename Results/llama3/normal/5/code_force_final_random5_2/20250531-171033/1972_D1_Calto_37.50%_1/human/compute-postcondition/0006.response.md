Output State: **n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, i is 3, cnt is n + n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1) + x // y + (i > 1), x is n - (i * i - i), y is i * i**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 3. 

The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `x // y + (i > 1)` to its original value. Since `x` is `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` is `i * i`, `x // y` is `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i)`. Given that `i` is 3, this simplifies to `(n - 6) // 9`. The term `(i > 1)` evaluates to `True` since `i` is 3, which is equivalent to 1 in a boolean context. Therefore, `cnt` becomes `n + n - (i * i - i) // (i * i) + (i > 1) + (n - 6) // 9 + 1`.

The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`, which is `n - 6` since `i` is 3.

The value of `y` is updated to `i * i`, which is `9` since `i` is 3.
