Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', i is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer, its type remains the same. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `arr`. Since `arr` was already a string, its type remains the same.

The values of `t`, `results`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain the same. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input, and the value of `arr` is updated to the string value of the input.

The condition that determines the value of `results` is based on the number of 'U' characters in `arr`. Since the code snippet does not modify the number of 'U' characters in `arr`, the value of `results` remains the same. If the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd, `results` contains 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'no'.
