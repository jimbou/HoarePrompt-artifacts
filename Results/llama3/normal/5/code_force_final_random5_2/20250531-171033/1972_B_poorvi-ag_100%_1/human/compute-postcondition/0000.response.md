Output State: **t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`. Since `t` is an integer, it is now equal to the number of test cases minus one. The second line creates an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected.
