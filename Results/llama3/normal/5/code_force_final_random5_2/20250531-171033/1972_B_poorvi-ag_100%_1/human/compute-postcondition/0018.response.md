Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', i is t-1, n is an integer, arr is a string. If the count of 'U' in arr is odd, then results contains at least one 'yes'. Otherwise, results contains at least one 'no' for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `t` will be the same as it was before the loop started, the `results` list will contain a 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` will be one less than the value of `t`, and the values of `n` and `arr` will be the values from the last iteration of the loop. The `results` list will contain at least one 'yes' if the count of 'U' in `arr` was odd for any iteration of the loop, and at least one 'no' for each iteration where the count of 'U' in `arr` was even.
