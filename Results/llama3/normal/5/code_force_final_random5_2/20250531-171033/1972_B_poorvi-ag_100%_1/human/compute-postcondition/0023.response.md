The code prints the second element in the list `results`. Since `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' and must have at least 2 elements, the second element `i` will be either 'yes' or 'no'. If the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is odd, then `results` contains at least one 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` contains at least one 'no'. However, the exact value of `i` depends on the specific contents of the `results` list, which is not provided. Therefore, the print statement will output either 'yes' or 'no', depending on the value of `i`.

Output: **'yes' or 'no' (where 'yes' or 'no' is the second element in the list results)**
