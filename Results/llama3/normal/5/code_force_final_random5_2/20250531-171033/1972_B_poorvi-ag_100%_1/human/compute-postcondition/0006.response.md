Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The number of 'U' characters in `arr` is even**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'no'. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer greater than 0, `i` still being 0, `n` still being an integer, and `arr` still being a string with an even number of 'U' characters. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
