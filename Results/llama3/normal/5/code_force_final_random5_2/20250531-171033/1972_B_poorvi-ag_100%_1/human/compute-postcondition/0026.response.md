The code prints the third element in the list `results` which can be either 'yes' or 'no'. The value of `i` depends on the count of 'U' in the string `arr`. If the count of 'U' is odd, then `i` is 'yes'. Otherwise, `i` is 'no'.
Output: **yes or no (where yes is printed if the count of 'U' in the string arr is odd, otherwise no)**
