Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines whether the count of "U" in the string is odd or even and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the results list accordingly. Finally, it prints all elements in the results list. The function effectively classifies each test case based on the parity of "U" counts in the input strings and outputs the corresponding results.**
