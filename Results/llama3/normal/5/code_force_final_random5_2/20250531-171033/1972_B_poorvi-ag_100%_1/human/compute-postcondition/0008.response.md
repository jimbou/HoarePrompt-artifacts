To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `results`, `n`, and `arr`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string. If the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd, `results` contains 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'no'.**
