Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least t elements, i is the last element in the list, n is an integer, arr is a string. If the count of 'U' in arr is odd, then results contains at least one 'yes'. Otherwise, results contains at least one 'no', and all elements of the results list have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the list `results` will have at least `t` elements, and all elements in the list will have been printed. The value of `i` will be the last element in the list, and the other variables `n` and `arr` will remain unchanged. The condition regarding the count of 'U' in `arr` and the presence of 'yes' or 'no' in `results` still holds true.
