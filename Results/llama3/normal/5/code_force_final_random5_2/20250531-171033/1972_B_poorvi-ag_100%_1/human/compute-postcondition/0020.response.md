The code prints the first element in the list `results`, which contains either 'yes' or 'no'. Since the list `results` must have at least 1 element, the print statement will output either 'yes' or 'no'. The value of `i` is the first element in the list `results`.
Output: **yes or no (where yes or no is the first element in the list results)**
