The code appends the string 'yes' to the list results. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of arr still contains an odd number of 'U' characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string containing an odd number of 'U' characters, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
