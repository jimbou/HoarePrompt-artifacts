Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by counting the number of 'U's in the string. If the count is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. The program correctly implements this logic.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the coins. It then checks if the count of 'U's in `arr` is odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is odd, it appends 'yes' to the `results` list; otherwise, it appends 'no'.

Finally, the program prints each element in the `results` list, which contains the outcome of each test case.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
