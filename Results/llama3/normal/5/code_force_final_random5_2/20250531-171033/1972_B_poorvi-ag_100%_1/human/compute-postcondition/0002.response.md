Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, results is an empty list, i is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, and then reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. The values of `t`, `results`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by two.
