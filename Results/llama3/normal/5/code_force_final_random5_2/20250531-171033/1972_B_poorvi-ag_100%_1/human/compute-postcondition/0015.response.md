The code `results.append('yes')` adds the string 'yes' to the end of the list `results`. The initial state of `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'. After the code is executed, `results` will contain at least one 'yes' in addition to its initial elements. The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' and at least one 'yes', `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string.**
