#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', i is t-1, n is an integer, arr is a string. If the count of 'U' in arr is odd, then results contains at least one 'yes'. Otherwise, results contains at least one 'no' for each iteration of the loop.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least t elements, i is the last element in the list, n is an integer, arr is a string. If the count of 'U' in arr is odd, then results contains at least one 'yes'. Otherwise, results contains at least one 'no', and all elements of the results list have been printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines whether the count of "U" in the string is odd or even and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the results list accordingly. Finally, it prints all elements in the results list. The function effectively classifies each test case based on the parity of "U" counts in the input strings and outputs the corresponding results.
