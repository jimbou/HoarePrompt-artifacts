The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers, the input for `t` is the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n).**
