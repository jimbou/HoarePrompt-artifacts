Output State: **t is at least 0, _ is t, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], i is -1, stdin is empty, and the list p is printed for each test case.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variable `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 0, and `a` is still a list of `n` integers. The list `p` has been calculated and printed for each test case, where the value at index `i` is `mex - a[i]`. The variable `mex` has been updated to the minimum value between its original value and `mex - a[i]`. The variable `i` has reached the value of `-1`, indicating that the inner loop has finished executing. Finally, `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
