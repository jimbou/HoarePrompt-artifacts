Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is -1, mex is n, t is at least 3, _ is 2, i is -1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer, but its exact value is not specified. The list `a` contains `n` integers, but their values are not specified. The list `p` contains `n` integers, all of which are -1. The variable `mex` has the same value as `n`. The variable `t` is at least 3, but its exact value is not specified. The variable `_` has a value of 2. The variable `i` has a value of -1. The stdin is empty, indicating that all inputs have been read.
