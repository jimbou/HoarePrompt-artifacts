Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i] and all other values are -1, mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], t is at least 3, _ is 2, i is n - 2, stdin is empty**

The code modifies the value of `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]`, and then updates `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value and the new value of `p[i]`. This means that `mex` will be updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `mex - a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
