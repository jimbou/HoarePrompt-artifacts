According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n -1's`, `mex` is `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 and `i` is now `n - 1`. 

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n -1's`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `n - 1**
