To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from `n-1` and goes down to `-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

Before the loop starts, `i` is -1, which is not within the range of the loop. We need to adjust `i` to be within the range of the loop.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of -1 repeated `n` times, `mex` is `n`, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

Note that I've adjusted `n` to be at least 1, and `i` to be `n-1`, which is the starting value of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
