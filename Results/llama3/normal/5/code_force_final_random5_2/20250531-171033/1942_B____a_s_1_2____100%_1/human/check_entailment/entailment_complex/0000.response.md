Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to -1.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which will keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
5. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
6. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` in the permutation as `mex - a[i]`.
7. It updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
8. After iterating over all elements of `a`, the program prints the permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct because it follows the definition of the MEX function and the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The use of the `mex` variable to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation is also correct.

The execution states of the program provided as comments confirm that the program behaves as expected. The final state of the program shows that the list `p` is printed for each test case, which is the desired output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
