Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i] and all other values are -1, mex is the minimum value between its original value and mex - a[i], t is at least 2, _ is 1, i is n-2, stdin is empty**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the value of mex - a[i] to p[i]. Since p[i] was -1, it is updated to mex - a[i]. The second line assigns the minimum value between mex and p[i] to mex. Since mex is the minimum value between its original value and mex - a[i], it is updated to the minimum value between its original value and mex - a[i]. No other variables are affected.
