Output State: **n is an integer at least 0, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum value between its original value and mex - a[i], t is at least 2, _ is 1, i is -1, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final values. The loop iterates from n-1 to -1, and after the loop finishes, the value of i will be -1. The list p will have values calculated as mex - a[i] for each index i, and mex will be the minimum value between its original value and mex - a[i]. The other variables, t, _, and stdin, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
