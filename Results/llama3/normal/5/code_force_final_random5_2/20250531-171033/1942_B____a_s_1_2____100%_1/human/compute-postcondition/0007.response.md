To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which means `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 3`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n - 1`'s with the value at index `i` changed to `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum of its original value and `mex - a[i]`, `i` is `n - 3`**
