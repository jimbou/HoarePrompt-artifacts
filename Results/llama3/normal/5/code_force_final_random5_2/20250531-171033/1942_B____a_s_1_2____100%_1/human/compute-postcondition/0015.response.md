Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i] and all other values are -1, mex is the minimum value between its original value and mex - a[i], t is at least 2, _ is 1, i is n-1, stdin is empty**

The code modifies the value of `p` at index `i` to be `mex - a[i]`, and updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum between its original value and the new value of `p[i]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `t`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin is empty after the code execution.
