Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`. The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order, calculating the value of `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to index `i`. The program then updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

This approach ensures that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`. The program also handles the case where `a_i` is negative, as it correctly calculates the value of `p[i]` in this case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The use of the `mex` variable to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to index `i` is a key insight that allows the program to efficiently construct the permutation `p`.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
