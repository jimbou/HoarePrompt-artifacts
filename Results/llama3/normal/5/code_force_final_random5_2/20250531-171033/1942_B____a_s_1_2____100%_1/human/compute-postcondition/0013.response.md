Output State: **n is an integer at least 0, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of -1 repeated n times, mex is n, t is at least 2, _ is 1, i is -1, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

In this final state, the value of `n` is an integer at least 0, which is assigned from the input. The list `a` contains `n` integers, which are also assigned from the input. The list `p` is initialized with `-1` repeated `n` times. The variable `mex` is set to `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
