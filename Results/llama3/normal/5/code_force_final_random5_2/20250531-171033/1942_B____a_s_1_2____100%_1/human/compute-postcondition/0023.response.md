The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `i` is `mex` - `a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum value between its original value and `mex` - `a[i]`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `i` is -1, `stdin` is empty, and the list `p` is printed, where `p` contains values calculated as `mex` - `a[i]` for each index `i`**
