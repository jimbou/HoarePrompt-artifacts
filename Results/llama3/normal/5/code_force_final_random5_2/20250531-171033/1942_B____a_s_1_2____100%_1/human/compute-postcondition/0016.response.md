To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `n-1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-2`.

The other variables in the loop head are `n`, but since `n` is not modified by the loop statement, its value remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `i` is mex - `a[i]` and all other values are -1, `mex` is the minimum value between its original value and mex - `a[i]`, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `stdin` is empty**
