Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i] and all other values are -1, mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], t is at least 3, _ is 2, i is n - 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `p` at index `i` has been updated to `mex - a[i]`, and the value of `mex` has been updated to the minimum value between its original value and the new value of `p[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
