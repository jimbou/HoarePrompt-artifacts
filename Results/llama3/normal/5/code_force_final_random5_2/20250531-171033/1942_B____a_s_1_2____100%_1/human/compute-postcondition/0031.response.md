Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], t is at least 3, _ is 2, i is -1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable 'i' has reached its final value of -1. The list 'p' now contains the values 'mex - a[i]' for all indices 'i', and the variable 'mex' has been updated to be the minimum value between its initial value and the values 'mex - a[i]' for all 'i'. The other variables 'n', 'a', 't', '_', and 'stdin' remain unchanged.
