Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, where `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program correctly reads the input, initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` values, and sets the initial value of `mex` to `n`. It then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, calculating the value of `p_i` as `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p_i`.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required calculation. The use of the `min` function to update `mex` ensures that it always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `a_i` is negative or when `mex` is updated to a value that is already present in the array.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
