The code prints the elements of the list `p`, which is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `i` is `mex - a[i]`. Since `mex` is the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - a[i]`, it means that `mex` is the smallest possible value that can be obtained by subtracting an element of `a` from `mex`.

Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `i` is `mex - a[i]`, it means that `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the difference between `mex` and the corresponding element in `a`.

Therefore, the output will be a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the difference between `mex` and the corresponding element in `a`.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]]**
