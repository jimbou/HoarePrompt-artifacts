Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct the permutation p based on the given array a. The program iterates over the array a in reverse order and calculates the value of p[i] as mex - a[i], where mex is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array p. The program then updates the value of mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i]. This ensures that the constructed permutation p satisfies the given condition.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array a contains negative numbers, as it initializes the array p with -1 and updates the value of mex accordingly.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct permutation p for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
