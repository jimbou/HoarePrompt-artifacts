Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i] and all other values are -1, mex is the minimum value between its original value and mex - a[i], t is at least 2, _ is 1, i is n-3, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the value of `p` at index `i` has been updated to `mex - a[i]`, and the value of `mex` has been updated to the minimum value between its original value and `mex - a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
