The code prints the elements of the list `p`. The list `p` is defined as a list of `n` integers, where the value at index `i` is `mex - a[i]`. Here, `mex` is the minimum value between its original value and `mex - a[i]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `mex` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `p`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `p`, which are the differences between `mex` and the corresponding elements in `a`.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum value between its original value and mex - a[i], and a[i] is the ith element of the list a)**
