Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1's, mex is n**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains at least 1, and the value of `_` remains 0, as they are not modified by the code. The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, so `n` becomes an integer. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`, so `a` becomes a list of `n` integers. The code also initializes a list `p` with `n` elements, all set to -1, and assigns `n` to `mex`.
