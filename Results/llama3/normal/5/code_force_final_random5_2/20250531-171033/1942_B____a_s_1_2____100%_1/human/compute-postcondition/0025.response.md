To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0. Additionally, we can adjust the state of `i` to be `n - 1`, which is the initial value of `i` in the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `i` is -1, `mex` is `n`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty**
