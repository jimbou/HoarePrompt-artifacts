To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `n - 1` down to `0` in decrements of `1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is at least `1`
* `_` is `0`
* `n` is an integer that must be at least `1`
* `a` is a list of `n` integers
* `p` is a list of `n - 1`'s with the value at index `i` changed to `mex - a[i]`
* `mex` is the minimum of its original value and `mex - a[i]`
* `i` is `n - 1`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` (if necessary).

Since the loop iterates in decrements of `1`, the next value of `i` will be `n - 2`. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to `n - 2`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `p`, and `mex`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n - 1`'s with the value at index `i` changed to `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum of its original value and `mex - a[i]`, `i` is `n - 2`**
