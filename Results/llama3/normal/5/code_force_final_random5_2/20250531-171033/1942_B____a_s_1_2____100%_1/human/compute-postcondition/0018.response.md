To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop iterates from `n-1` to `-1` in reverse order, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently `n-2`, decrementing it by 1 would make it `n-3`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `i` is mex - `a[i]` and all other values are -1, `mex` is the minimum value between its original value and mex - `a[i]`, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `i` is `n-3`, `stdin` is empty**
