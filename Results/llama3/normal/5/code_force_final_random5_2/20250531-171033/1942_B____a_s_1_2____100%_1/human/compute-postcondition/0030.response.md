Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n integers where the value at index i is mex - a[i] and all other values are -1, mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], t is at least 3, _ is 2, i is n - 3, stdin is empty**

The code snippet modifies the value of `p[i]` and `mex`. The first line assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`, updating the value at index `i` in the list `p`. The second line updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum between its current value and the new value of `p[i]`. 

Since `i` is `n - 3`, the value at index `i` in the list `p` is updated to `mex - a[i]`. The value of `mex` is then updated to be the minimum between its current value and the new value of `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[i]`. 

All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `a` is still a list of `n` integers, `t` is still at least 3, `_` is still 2, and `stdin` is still empty.
