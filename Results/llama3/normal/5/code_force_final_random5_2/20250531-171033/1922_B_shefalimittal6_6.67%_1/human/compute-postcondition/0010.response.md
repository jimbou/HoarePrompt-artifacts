Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, a new variable `res` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
