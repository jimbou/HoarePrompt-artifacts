Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0, `cnt` is the next value in the dictionary, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code adds the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time to the value of `res`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated with the new value; otherwise, it remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
