The only object in the loop head is variable cnt, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens dictionary. If the dictionary has at least 2 key-value pairs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, num_of_lens has at least 1 key-value pair, cnt is the value of the first key-value pair. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 2 key-value pairs and cnt is the value of the second key-value pair.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, cnt is the value of the second key-value pair in num_of_lens**
