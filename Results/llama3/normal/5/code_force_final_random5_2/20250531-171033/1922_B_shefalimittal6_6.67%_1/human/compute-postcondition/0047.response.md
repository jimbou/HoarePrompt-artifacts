Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list nums as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of x is increased by n times, and num_of_lens is not empty, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list, cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is increased by math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum, where total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is still greater than or equal to 2. The value of `res` is increased by the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The value of `total_sum` is calculated by summing up all the values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
