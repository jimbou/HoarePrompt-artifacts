To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for x in nums:`.

The objects in the loop head are `x` and `nums`. To execute the loop again, we need to consider the following:

* `x` is the current element being processed in the list `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `x` should be the next element in the list.
* `nums` is the list of integers. For the loop to execute again, the list should have at least one more element.

Considering the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is a positive integer greater than 0 (no change needed)
* `_` is 0 (no change needed)
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (no change needed)
* `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list `nums` as a key and its count as the value (no change needed)
* `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 1 integer (should have at least one more integer)
* `x` is the first integer in the list (should be the next integer in the list)

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list `nums` as a key and its count as the value, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
