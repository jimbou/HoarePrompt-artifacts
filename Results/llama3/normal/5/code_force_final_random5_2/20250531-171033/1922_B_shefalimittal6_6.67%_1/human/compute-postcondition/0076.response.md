Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `nums` and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list `nums`, if the first value in the dictionary `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is equal to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.***
