Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, which is the input from the first line of the test case. The `num_of_lens` dictionary is empty as it is initialized but not populated. The `nums` list contains `n` integers between 0 and `n`, which are the inputs from the second line of the test case. Finally, the stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been processed.
