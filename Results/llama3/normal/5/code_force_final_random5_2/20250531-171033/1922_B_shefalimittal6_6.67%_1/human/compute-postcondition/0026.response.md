Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list nums as keys and their respective counts as values that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list, res is the sum of the number of combinations of cnt items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res remains 0, cnt is the next value in the dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, total_sum is the sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt, res is incremented by the product of the number of combinations of cnt items taken 2 at a time and total_sum.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `x`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and `total_sum` to its previous value. The value of `cnt` is also updated to the next value in the dictionary. The value of `total_sum` is calculated as the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`.
