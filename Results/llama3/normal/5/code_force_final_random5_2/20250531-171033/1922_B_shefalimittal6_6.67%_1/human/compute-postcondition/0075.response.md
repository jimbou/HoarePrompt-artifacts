Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `nums` and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the first value in the dictionary and is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is equal to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be equal to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, which is the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
