The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the x is the second integer in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `nums` and the value is 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n` that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is not defined, `res` is not defined, stdin contains no input**
