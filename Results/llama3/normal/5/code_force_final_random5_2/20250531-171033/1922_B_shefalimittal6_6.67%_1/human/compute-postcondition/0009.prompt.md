Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for x in nums:
    num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list `nums` as a key and its count as the value, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list `nums` as a key and its count as the value, where the count of `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list `nums` as a key and its count as the value, where the count of `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
