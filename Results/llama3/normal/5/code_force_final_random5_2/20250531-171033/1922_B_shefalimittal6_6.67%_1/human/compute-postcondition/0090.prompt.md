Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `nums` and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is not defined, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is equal to its original value plus the product of math.comb(cnt, 2) and the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, cnt is the value of the second key-value pair in num_of_lens. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is increased by the number of combinations of cnt taken 2 at a time times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, no change is made to res.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, cnt is the value of the first key-value pair in num_of_lens. If cnt is greater than or equal to 3, res is increased by cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) / 6. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, and res is increased by math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum. Otherwise, no changes are made to res.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
