The code prints the total number of combinations of triples and pairs of integers in the list `nums` that satisfy certain conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the variables involved:

*   `res`: This variable accumulates the total number of combinations. It starts at 0 and is updated based on the count of each integer in the list `nums`.
*   `cnt`: This variable represents the count of each integer in the list `nums`. It is obtained from the `num_of_lens` dictionary.
*   `total_sum`: This variable represents the sum of the counts of all integers in the list `nums` except the one that occurs `cnt` times.

The conditions for updating `res` are:

*   If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time.
*   If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`.

The final value of `res` represents the total number of combinations of triples and pairs of integers in the list `nums` that satisfy these conditions.

Output: **the total number of combinations of triples and pairs of integers in the list `nums` that satisfy the conditions described above**
