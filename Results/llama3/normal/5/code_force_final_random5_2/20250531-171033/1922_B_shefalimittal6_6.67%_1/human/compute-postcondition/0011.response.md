The only object in the loop head is variable  cnt and dictionary  num_of_lens, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the dictionary has at least 1 key-value pair the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, res is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the dictionary must have at least 1 key-value pair and the cnt is the value of the first key-value pair.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, cnt is the value of the first key-value pair**
