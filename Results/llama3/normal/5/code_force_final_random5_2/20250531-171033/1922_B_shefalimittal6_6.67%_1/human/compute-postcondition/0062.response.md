The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, and `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the last value in the sequence of values in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, and the product of the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, and the total sum of counts in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`, for all values of `cnt` in `num_of_lens` that are greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `res` is being printed**
