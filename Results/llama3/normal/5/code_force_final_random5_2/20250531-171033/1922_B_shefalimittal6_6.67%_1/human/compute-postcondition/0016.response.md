Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list nums as keys and their respective counts as values that must have at least 1 key-value pair, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list, res is the sum of the number of combinations of cnt items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res remains 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, cnt is greater than or equal to 2, total_sum is the sum of the number of occurrences of all integers in the list except the one that occurs cnt times, res is increased by the product of the number of combinations of cnt items taken 2 at a time and total_sum.**

The code calculates the total sum of the occurrences of all integers in the list except the one that occurs `cnt` times, and then increases `res` by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`. The value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, so the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time is at least 1. The value of `res` is increased by this product, so it is now greater than its previous value. The value of `total_sum` is the sum of the number of occurrences of all integers in the list except the one that occurs `cnt` times, so it is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, so `total_sum` is also an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5. The value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, so the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time is at least 1. The value of `res` is increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`, so it is now greater than its previous value.
