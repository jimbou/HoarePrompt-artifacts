The `print(res)` statement will print the calculated result of combinations of the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

The value of `res` is the sum of two parts:

1. The sum of the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time. This is calculated using the formula for combinations: `nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)`, where `n` is the value in `num_of_lens` and `r` is 3.

2. The sum of the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time times the sum of all other values in `num_of_lens`. This is also calculated using the combinations formula, but with `r` being 2, and then multiplied by the sum of all other values in `num_of_lens`.

Since the exact values in `num_of_lens` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result of combinations.

Output: **the sum of the number of combinations of each value in num_of_lens taken 3 at a time plus the sum of the number of combinations of each value in num_of_lens taken 2 at a time times the sum of all other values in num_of_lens**
