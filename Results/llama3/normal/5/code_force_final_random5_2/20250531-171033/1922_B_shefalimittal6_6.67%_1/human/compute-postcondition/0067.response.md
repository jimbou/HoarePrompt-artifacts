Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `nums` and the value is 1, and the value of the key `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n` that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is not defined, `res` is not defined, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, where `x` is the second integer in the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `num_of_lens` now has an updated value for the key `x`, which is the second integer in the list `nums`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
