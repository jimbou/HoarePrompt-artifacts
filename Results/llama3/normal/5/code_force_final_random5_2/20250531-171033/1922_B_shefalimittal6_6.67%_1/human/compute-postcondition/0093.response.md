Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, and `res` is not defined.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `x`, `cnt`, and `res` will no longer be defined, as they were only used within the loop and are no longer needed after the loop finishes.
