Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the number of combinations of these integers that can form pairs or triplets, and prints the total count for each test case. The function does not modify the input data and does not return any value, only printing the results to standard output.**
