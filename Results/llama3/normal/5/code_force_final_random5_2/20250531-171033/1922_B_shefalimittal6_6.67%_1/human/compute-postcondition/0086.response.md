The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` adds the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time to the variable `res`. The value of `cnt` is the value of the first key-value pair in the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

Since `cnt` is the value of the first key-value pair in `num_of_lens`, it represents the number of times the first integer in the list `nums` appears in the list. The value of `cnt` is unknown, but it is a positive integer because `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair.

The `math.comb(cnt, 3)` function calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time, which is equal to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) / 6`.

The value of `res` is increased by this amount.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `nums` and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the value of the first key-value pair in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) / 6`.**
