The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. The current value of `num_of_lens[x]` is the count of the first integer in the list `nums` which is `x`. Since `x` is the second integer in the list, its count is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list `nums` as a key and its count as the value, where the count of `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
