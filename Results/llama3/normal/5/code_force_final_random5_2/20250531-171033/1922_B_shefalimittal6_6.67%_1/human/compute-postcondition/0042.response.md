To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. The loop will execute if `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, meaning it's not an empty dictionary.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, and `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0, `cnt` is the value of the first key-value pair in `num_of_lens`**
