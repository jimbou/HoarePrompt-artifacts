Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, and `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of values in `num_of_lens`, which is different from the previous value. If `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the total sum of counts in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`.***
