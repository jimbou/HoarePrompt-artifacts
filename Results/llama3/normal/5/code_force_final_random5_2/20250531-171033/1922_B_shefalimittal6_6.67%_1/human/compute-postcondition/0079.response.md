Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is equal to its original value plus the product of math.comb(cnt, 2) and the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
