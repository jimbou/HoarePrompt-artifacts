Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, and `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of values in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated by adding the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, which is calculated using the `math.comb` function. The other variables remain unchanged.
