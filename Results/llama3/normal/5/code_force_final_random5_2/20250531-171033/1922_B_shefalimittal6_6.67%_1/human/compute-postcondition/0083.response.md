Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, cnt is the value of the second key-value pair in num_of_lens, res is increased by the number of combinations of cnt taken 2 at a time times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `cnt` also remains the same as it is not updated by the code. However, the value of `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. This means that `res` is now equal to its original value plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
