Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain unchanged except for `res`, which is now set to 0. The counts of integers in the list `nums` are still updated in the dictionary `num_of_lens`, and the value of `x` is still the last integer in the list. However, the value of `res` is reset to 0.
