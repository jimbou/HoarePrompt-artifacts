Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, cnt is the value of the first key-value pair in num_of_lens. If cnt is greater than or equal to 3, res is increased by cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) / 6. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, and res is increased by math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum. Otherwise, no changes are made to res.***
