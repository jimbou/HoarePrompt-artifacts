Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `nums` and the value is 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n` that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is not defined, `res` is not defined, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 2, and the value of `_` remains 2. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. The dictionary `num_of_lens` now has at least one key-value pair, where the key is the first integer in the list `nums` and the value is 1, indicating that this integer appears at least once in the list. The list `nums` remains unchanged, with `n` integers between 0 and `n`, and `x` is still the first integer in the list. The variables `cnt` and `res` are still not defined, and there is no input in stdin.
