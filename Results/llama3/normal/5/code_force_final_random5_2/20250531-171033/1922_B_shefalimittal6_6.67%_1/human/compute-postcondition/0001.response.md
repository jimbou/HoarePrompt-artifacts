The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer and stdin contains multiple test cases, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, stdin now contains one less test case.**
