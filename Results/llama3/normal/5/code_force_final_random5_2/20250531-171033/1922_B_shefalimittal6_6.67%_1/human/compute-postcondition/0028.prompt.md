Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the number of occurrences of all integers in the list except the one that occurs `cnt` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list nums as keys and their respective counts as values that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list, res is the sum of the number of combinations of cnt items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res remains 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is increased by the product of the number of combinations of cnt items taken 2 at a time and the sum of the counts of all integers in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, no change is made to res.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the next value in the dictionary, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0, and `res` is incremented by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
