Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n, `x` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `_`, and `n` as in the initial state. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will now contain all integers from the `nums` list as keys, with their respective counts as values. The `nums` list remains unchanged, and `x` will be the last integer in the list. The stdin will still contain multiple test cases minus one.
