Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, stdin now contains one less test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    num_of_lens = {}
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for x in nums:
        num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
    res = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
        if cnt >= 2:
            total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
            res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, and the value of `res` is being printed, where `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the number of occurrences of all integers in the list except the one that occurs `cnt` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, and `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the last value in the sequence of values in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, and the product of the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, and the total sum of counts in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`, for all values of `cnt` in `num_of_lens` that are greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, cnt is not defined, res is the sum of the number of combinations of each value in num_of_lens taken 3 at a time plus the sum of the number of combinations of each value in num_of_lens taken 2 at a time times the sum of all other values in num_of_lens, and the value of res is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
