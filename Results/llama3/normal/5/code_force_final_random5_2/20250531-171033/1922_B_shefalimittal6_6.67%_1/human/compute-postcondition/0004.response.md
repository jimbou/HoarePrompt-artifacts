Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list `nums` as a key and its count as the value, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens` has been updated to include the count of the first integer in the list `nums`. The count is incremented by 1 if the integer is already present in the dictionary, otherwise, it is initialized to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
