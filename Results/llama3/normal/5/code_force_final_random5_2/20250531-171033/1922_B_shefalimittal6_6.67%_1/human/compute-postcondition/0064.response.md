The only variable in the loop head is variable x and list nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list nums. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, x is the last integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is the first integer in the list.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list, cnt is not defined, res is not defined, stdin contains no input**
