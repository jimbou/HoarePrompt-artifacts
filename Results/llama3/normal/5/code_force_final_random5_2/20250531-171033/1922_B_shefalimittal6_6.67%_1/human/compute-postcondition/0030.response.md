Output: ** `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, and the value of `res` is being printed, where `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the number of occurrences of all integers in the list except the one that occurs `cnt` times.**
