The code prints the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, and the product of the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, and the total sum of counts in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`, for all values of `cnt` in `num_of_lens` that are greater than or equal to 2.
Output: **sum of the number of ways to choose 3 items from cnt items without repetition and without order, and the product of the number of ways to choose 2 items from cnt items without repetition and without order, and the total sum of counts in num_of_lens excluding cnt, for all values of cnt in num_of_lens that are greater than or equal to 2**
