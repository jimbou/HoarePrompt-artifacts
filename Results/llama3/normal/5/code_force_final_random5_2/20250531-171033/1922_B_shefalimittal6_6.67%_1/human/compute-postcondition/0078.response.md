Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, res is equal to its original value plus the product of math.comb(cnt, 2) and the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, cnt is greater than or equal to 2.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `res`. The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. This means that `res` now includes the additional combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time, multiplied by the total count of all other numbers in `num_of_lens`.
