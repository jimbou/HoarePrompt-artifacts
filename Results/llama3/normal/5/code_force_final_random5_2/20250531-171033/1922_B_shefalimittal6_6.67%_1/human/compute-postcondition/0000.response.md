Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, stdin now contains one less test case.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before since we have already read one integer. Each test case still consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The constraints on the values of n and a_i are still valid.
