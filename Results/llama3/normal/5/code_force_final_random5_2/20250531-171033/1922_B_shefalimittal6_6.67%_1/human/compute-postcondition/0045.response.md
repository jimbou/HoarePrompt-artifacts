Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, and `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list. If the value of the first key-value pair in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is set to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.***
