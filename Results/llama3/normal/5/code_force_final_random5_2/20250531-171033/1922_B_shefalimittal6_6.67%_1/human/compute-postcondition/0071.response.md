Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, cnt is not defined, res is not defined, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the dictionary `num_of_lens` will have `n` key-value pairs, where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list. The variable `x` will be the last integer in the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
