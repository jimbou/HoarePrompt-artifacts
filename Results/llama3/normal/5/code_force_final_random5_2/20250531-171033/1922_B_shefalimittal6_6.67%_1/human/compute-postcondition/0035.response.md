State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n` that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and its previous value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the number of occurrences of all integers in the list except the one that occurs `cnt` times**
