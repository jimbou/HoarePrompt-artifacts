Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list `nums` as a key and its count as the value, where the count of `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, where `x` is the third integer in the list `nums`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
