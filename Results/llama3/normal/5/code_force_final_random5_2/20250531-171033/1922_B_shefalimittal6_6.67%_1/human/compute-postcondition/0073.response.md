The only objects in the loop head are variables  cnt and num_of_lens, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the dictionary has at least 1 key-value pair the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list nums and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list nums, cnt is not defined, res is 0, stdin contains no input. So for the loop to be executed  the dictionary must have at least 1 key-value pair and the cnt is the first value in the dictionary.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `nums` and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the first value in the dictionary, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.**
