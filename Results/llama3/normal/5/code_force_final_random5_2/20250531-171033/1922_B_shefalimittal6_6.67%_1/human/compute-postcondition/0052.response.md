Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list nums as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of x is increased by n times, and num_of_lens is not empty, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list, cnt is the next value in the sequence of values in num_of_lens, res is increased by the number of combinations of cnt taken 3 at a time plus the product of the number of combinations of cnt taken 2 at a time and the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `x`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is in the value of `res`, which is increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time and the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. This is because the code calculates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` and multiplies it by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time, and then adds this product to the original value of `res`.
