Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list, cnt is not defined, res is not defined, stdin contains no input**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. The second line creates an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. The third line assigns a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n` to `nums`. The last integer in the list is assigned to `x`. The variables `cnt` and `res` are not defined in the code snippet, so their values are not updated. The stdin is empty after the code execution. The variables `t` and `_` are not affected by the code and remain the same.
