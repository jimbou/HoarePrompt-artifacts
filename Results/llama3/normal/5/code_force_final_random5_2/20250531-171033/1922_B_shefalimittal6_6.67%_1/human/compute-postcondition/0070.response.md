Output State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the integers in the list `nums` and the values are the counts of each integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is not defined, `res` is not defined, stdin contains no input.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the dictionary `num_of_lens` will contain the count of each integer in the list `nums`, and the variable `x` will be the last integer in the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
