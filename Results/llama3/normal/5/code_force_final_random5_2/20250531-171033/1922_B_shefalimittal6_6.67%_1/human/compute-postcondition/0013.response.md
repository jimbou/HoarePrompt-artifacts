Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and its previous value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time, which is calculated using the `math.comb` function. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, and the value of `cnt` is still greater than or equal to 3.
