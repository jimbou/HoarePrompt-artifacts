Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, and `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list. If the value of the first key-value pair in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is set to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list nums as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of x is increased by n times, and num_of_lens is not empty, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list, cnt is the next value in the sequence of values in num_of_lens. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is increased by the number of combinations of cnt taken 3 at a time plus the product of the number of combinations of cnt taken 2 at a time and the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of `x` is increased by `n` times, and `num_of_lens` is not empty, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of values in `num_of_lens`, which is different from the previous value. If `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the total sum of counts in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
