Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `nums` and the value is the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and `n`, `x` is the last integer in the list `nums`, `cnt` is not defined, `res` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `num_of_lens` still contains the frequency of each integer in the list `nums`, and `x` is still the last integer in the list `nums`. The stdin remains empty, containing no input.
