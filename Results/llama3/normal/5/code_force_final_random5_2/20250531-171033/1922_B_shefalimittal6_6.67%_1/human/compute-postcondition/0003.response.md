The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list nums. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is the first integer in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of n integers between 0 and n that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
