Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list nums as keys and their respective counts as values, where the count of x is increased by n times, and num_of_lens is not empty, nums is a list of n integers between 0 and n, x is the last integer in the list, cnt is the next value in the sequence of values in num_of_lens, which is different from the previous value, res is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 items from cnt items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the total sum of counts in num_of_lens excluding cnt, total_sum is the total sum of counts in num_of_lens excluding cnt.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `res` and introduces a new variable `total_sum`. The value of `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the total sum of counts in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`. The value of `total_sum` is the total sum of counts in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
