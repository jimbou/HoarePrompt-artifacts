Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even) and `x // i` which is the integer division of `x` by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.***
