To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and the range parameters.

1. `i`: The loop starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`, which means `i` should be the smallest odd number greater than or equal to 1. Since `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, the smallest possible value of `i` is 1 (when `x` is odd) or 3 (when `x` is even). However, since `i` is the next odd number in the sequence after the last iteration of the loop, we can assume that the loop has not executed yet, so `i` should be the smallest possible value.

2. `x`: The loop iterates up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, which means `x` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is at least 1). However, we already know that `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, so this condition is already satisfied.

3. Range parameters: The loop iterates with a step of 2, which means `i` will always be an odd number.

Considering these adjustments, the updated state is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the maximum value of the previous list `l`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
