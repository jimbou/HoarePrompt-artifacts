Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either `i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, or `x // i` otherwise. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `l` remains unchanged.***
