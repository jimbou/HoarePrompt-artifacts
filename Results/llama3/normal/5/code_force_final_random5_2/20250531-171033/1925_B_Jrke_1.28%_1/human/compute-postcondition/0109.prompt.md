Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`) after the last iteration of the loop, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the maximum value of the previous list `l`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even) if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` also contains `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the values 1, `i`, and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), or a list containing the values 1 and `x // i` (otherwise). Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `i` (if `i` is less than or equal to `k`). `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i`, and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), or a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i` (otherwise). `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the original `ans` and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), or the maximum of the original `ans`, `i`, and the maximum value in the original list `l` (otherwise).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
