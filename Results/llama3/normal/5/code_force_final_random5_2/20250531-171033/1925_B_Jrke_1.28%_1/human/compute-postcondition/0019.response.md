To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):`

The objects in the loop head are `i`, `x`, and the range object created by `range()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8
* `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`
* `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`
* `_` is 0 (this variable is not relevant to the loop)
* `i` is the first odd number greater than or equal to 1
* `ans` and `l` are dependent on `x` and `i`, but their values are not directly relevant to the loop head

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop's increment and termination conditions.

The loop increments `i` by 2 each time, starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`. This means that `i` will be the next odd number in the sequence.

The loop terminates when `i` reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given these conditions, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `i` will be the next odd number in the sequence, which is `i + 2`
* `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop
* `n`, `k`, `_`, `ans`, and `l` are not directly affected by the loop head and remain unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` and `l` are dependent on `x` and `i`**
