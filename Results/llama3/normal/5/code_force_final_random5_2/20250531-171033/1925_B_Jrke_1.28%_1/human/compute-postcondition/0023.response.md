Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is dependent on `x` and `i`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and `x`. The value of `k` is still an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `i` is still the next odd number in the sequence. The value of `ans` is still dependent on `x` and `i`. The list `l` now contains the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`.
