Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is dependent on `x` and `i`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be a list containing the value of `ans`, which is dependent on `x` and `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
