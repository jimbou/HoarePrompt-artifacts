The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the current value of `k` is 1 and 1 is printed, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, or `_`. However, it does move on to the next iteration of the loop, which means the next line of input from `stdin` will be processed.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, the current value of `k` is 1, 1 is printed, and the next line of input from `stdin` will be processed.**
