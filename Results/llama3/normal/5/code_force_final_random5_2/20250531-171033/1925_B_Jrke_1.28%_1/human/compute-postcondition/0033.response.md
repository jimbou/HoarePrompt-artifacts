Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `ans` and `i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, or `ans` and `x // i` otherwise, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`, which depends on the value of `x // i` and `k`. The list `l` also contains the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i`, depending on the same condition.
