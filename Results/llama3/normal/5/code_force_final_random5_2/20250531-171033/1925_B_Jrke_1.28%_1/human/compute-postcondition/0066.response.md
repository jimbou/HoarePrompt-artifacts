Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 5 (if `x` is odd) or 7 (if `x` is even), `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the previous list `l` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is `i`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is either 5 or 7, the list `l` now contains the maximum value from the previous list `l` and the value of `i`. The maximum value in the list `l` is now `i`, which is either 5 or 7. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
