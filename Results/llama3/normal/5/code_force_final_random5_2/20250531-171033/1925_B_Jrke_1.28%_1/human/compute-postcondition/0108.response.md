Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i`, and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), or a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i` (otherwise). `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the original `ans` and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), or the maximum of the original `ans`, `i`, and the maximum value in the original list `l` (otherwise).***
