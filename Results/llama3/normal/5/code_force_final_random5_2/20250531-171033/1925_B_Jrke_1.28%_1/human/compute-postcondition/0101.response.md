To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):`

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration (due to the `step` parameter of the `range` function), we need to increment `i` by 2 to get the new value.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the values 1, `i`, and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), or a list containing the values 1 and `x // i` (otherwise). Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `i` (if `i` is less than or equal to `k`). `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we increment `i` by 2 to get the new value.

If `x` is even, `i` was 5, so the new value of `i` is 7.

If `x` is odd, `i` was 3, so the new value of `i` is 5.

The other variables in the state (`x`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `l`, and `ans`) do not change, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the values 1, `i`, and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), or a list containing the values 1 and `x // i` (otherwise). Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `i` (if `i` is less than or equal to `k`). `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**
