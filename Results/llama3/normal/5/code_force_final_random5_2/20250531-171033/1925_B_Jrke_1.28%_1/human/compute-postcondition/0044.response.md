Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `if k is equal to 1` is still valid, and if it is true, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration will be skipped and the program will move to the next iteration.
