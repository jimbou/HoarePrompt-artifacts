Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd), `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i`, and `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the original `ans` and `x // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains the same, an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8. The value of `n` also remains the same, an integer between 1 and `x`. The value of `k` is still the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `i` is still 7 if `x` is even or 5 if `x` is odd. The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i`, and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The value of `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`, which is the maximum of the original `ans` and the integer division of `x` by `i`.
