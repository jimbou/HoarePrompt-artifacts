Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is the first odd number greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values, and a new variable `l` is introduced, which is a list containing the value of `ans`, which is 1.
