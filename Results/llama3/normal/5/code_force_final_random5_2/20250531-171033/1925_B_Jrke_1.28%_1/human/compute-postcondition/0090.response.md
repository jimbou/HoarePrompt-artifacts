Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even) if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` also contains `x // i`.***
