Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd), `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the original list `l`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The value of `i` is either 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd). The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the original list `l` and the value of `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
