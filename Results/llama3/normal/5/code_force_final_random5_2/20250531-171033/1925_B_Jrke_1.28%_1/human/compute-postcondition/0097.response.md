Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd), `ans` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 5 (if `x` is even) or 1, 3 (if `x` is odd), and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the initial values (1 and either 5 or 3, depending on the parity of `x`, if `i` is less than or equal to `k`) and the result of the division `x // i`.
