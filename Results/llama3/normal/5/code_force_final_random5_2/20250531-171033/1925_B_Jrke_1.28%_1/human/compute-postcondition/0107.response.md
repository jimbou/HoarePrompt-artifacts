Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd). If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i`, and `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the original `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the original `ans`, `i`, and the maximum value in the original list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i`, and `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum of these values. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of the original `ans`, `i`, and the maximum value in the original list `l`. The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
