Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 5 (if `x` is even) or 1 and 3 (if `x` is odd).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and `x`. The value of `k` is still an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `i` is still 5 if `x` is even or 3 if `x` is odd. The value of `ans` is still 1. The list `l` now contains two values: 1 and the value of `i`, which is 5 if `x` is even or 3 if `x` is odd.
