Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to contain only the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
