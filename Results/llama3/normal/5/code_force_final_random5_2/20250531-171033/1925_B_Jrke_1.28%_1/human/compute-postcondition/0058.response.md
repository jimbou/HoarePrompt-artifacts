Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 3 (if `x` is odd) or 1 and 5 (if `x` is even).**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `i`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the list `l`, which now contains two elements: the original value 1 and the new value `i`, which is either 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even).
