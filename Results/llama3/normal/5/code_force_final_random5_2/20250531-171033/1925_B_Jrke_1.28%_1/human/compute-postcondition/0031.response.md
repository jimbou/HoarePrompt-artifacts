Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the maximum value `ans` and either the value of `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the result of `x // i` otherwise.
