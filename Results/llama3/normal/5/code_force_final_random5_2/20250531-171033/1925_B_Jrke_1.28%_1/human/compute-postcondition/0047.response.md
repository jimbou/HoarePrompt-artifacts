Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be a list containing the value of `ans`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true.
