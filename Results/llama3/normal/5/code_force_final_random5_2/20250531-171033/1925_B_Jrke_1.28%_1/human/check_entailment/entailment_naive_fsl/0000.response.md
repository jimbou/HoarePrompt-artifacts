Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when x = 12 and n = 3, the program will output 3, but the correct answer is 4. This is because the program only checks odd divisors of x, but it should also check even divisors.

In this case, the optimal solution is to divide the problem into three sub-problems with difficulties 4, 4, and 4, which gives a balance of 4. However, the program does not consider this solution because it only checks odd divisors.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
