Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1.**

The list `l` now only contains the value of `ans` which is 1, regardless of the previous values of `i` and `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
