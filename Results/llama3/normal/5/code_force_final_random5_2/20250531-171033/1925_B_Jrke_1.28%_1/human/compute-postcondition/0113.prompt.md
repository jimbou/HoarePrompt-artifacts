Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    k = x // n
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            l = [ans]
            if i <= k:
                l.append(i)
            if x // i <= k:
                l.append(x // i)
            ans = max(l)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either `i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, or `x // i` otherwise. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `l` remains unchanged, and the maximum value in the list `l` which is `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`) after the last iteration of the loop, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l` which contains the maximum value of the previous list `l`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of `l` and `ans` remains unchanged, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`) after the last iteration of the loop, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value of the previous list `l`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and the maximum value in the list `l` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
