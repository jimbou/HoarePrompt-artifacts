Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains the value of `ans` and `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` being an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` being the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` being 0, and `i` being the next odd number in the sequence. The list `l` still contains the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`, or the value of `ans` and `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
