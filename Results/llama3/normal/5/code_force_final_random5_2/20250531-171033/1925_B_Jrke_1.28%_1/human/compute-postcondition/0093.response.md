To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and the loop range limits.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
```
We can see that:

* `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, since the step size is 2.
* The loop range starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`, which means that if `x` is even, the loop starts from 2, and if `x` is odd, the loop starts from 1.
* The loop range ends at `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, which is the integer square root of `x` plus 1.

Considering the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8.
* `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`.
* `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`.
* `_` is 0.
* `i` is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even).
* `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.
* `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even) if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` also contains `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 2, since the step size is 2. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be:

* If `x` is even, `i` will be 3 (since it was 1 in the previous iteration) + 2 = 5.
* If `x` is odd, `i` will be 1 + 2 = 3.

The other states remain unchanged, since they are not affected by the loop head.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd) if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` also contains `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
