Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `ans` is 1. If `k` is 1, 1 is printed and the next line of input from `stdin` will be processed. Otherwise, no action is taken.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the first odd number greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which contains the values of `ans` which is 1 and the value of `x` divided by `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains the values of `ans` which is 1 and the value of `x` divided by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains the value of `ans` and `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either `i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, or `x // i` otherwise. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `l` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
