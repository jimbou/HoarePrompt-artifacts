Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input from stdin, and `k` is calculated as the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The state of stdin is also updated, as one line of input has been consumed, leaving `t-1` lines remaining.
