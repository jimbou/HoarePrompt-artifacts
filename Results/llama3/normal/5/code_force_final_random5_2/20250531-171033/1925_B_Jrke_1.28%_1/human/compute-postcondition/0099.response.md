Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd), `l` is a list containing the values 1, 5 (if `x` is even) or 1, 3 (if `x` is odd), and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), or a list containing the values 1 and `x // i` (otherwise), and `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains either the values 1, 5 (if `x` is even), and `x // i`, or the values 1 and `x // i` (if `x` is odd or `x // i` is greater than `k`). The other variables remain unchanged.
