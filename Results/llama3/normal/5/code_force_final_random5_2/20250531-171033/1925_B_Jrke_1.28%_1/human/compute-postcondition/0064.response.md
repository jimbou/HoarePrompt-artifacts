To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):`

The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `x`.

According to the loop head, `i` starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`, which means if `x` is even, `i` starts from 2, and if `x` is odd, `i` starts from 1. The loop increments `i` by 2 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even). To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 2.

So, the new state of `i` is:

* If `x` is odd, `i` is 5.
* If `x` is even, `i` is 7.

The state of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `n`, `k`, `_`, `ans`, and `l`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 5 (if `x` is odd) or 7 (if `x` is even), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the values 1, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `x // i`.**
