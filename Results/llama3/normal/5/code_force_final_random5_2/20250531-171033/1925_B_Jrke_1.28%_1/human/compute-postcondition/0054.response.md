Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even), `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l` which is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even) and `x // i` which is the integer division of `x` by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans` is now the maximum value of the list `l`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
