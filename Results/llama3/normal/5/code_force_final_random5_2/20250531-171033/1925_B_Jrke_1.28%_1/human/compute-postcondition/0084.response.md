Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to a list containing only the value of `ans`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
