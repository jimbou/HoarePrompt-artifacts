Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd), `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l`, `ans` is the maximum value in the original list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and `x`. The value of `k` remains an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `_` remains 0. The value of `i` remains 7 if `x` is even or 5 if `x` is odd. The list `l` now contains only the maximum value from the original list `l`. The value of `ans` remains the maximum value in the original list `l`.
