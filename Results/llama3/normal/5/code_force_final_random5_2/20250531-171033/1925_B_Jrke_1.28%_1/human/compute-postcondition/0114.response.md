Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers x and n. It calculates the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to x divided by n, and prints this value for each test case. If x is not divisible by any number less than or equal to x divided by n, it prints 1. The function processes all test cases and outputs the maximum divisor for each case.**
