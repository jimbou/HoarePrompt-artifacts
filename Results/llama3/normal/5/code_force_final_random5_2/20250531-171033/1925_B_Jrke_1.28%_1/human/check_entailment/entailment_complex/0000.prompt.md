Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = x // n
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`) after the last iteration of the loop, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains the maximum value of the previous list `l`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of `l` and `ans` remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers x and n. It calculates the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to x divided by n, and prints this value for each test case. If x is not divisible by any number less than or equal to x divided by n, it prints 1. The function processes all test cases and outputs the maximum divisor for each case.
