Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 7 (if `x` is even) or 5 (if `x` is odd). If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the original list `l` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the original list `l`. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
