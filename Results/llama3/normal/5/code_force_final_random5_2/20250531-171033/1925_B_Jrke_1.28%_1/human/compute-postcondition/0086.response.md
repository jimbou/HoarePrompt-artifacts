Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 1 (or 3 if `x` is even). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the list `l` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is either 1 or 3 depending on whether `x` is even or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
