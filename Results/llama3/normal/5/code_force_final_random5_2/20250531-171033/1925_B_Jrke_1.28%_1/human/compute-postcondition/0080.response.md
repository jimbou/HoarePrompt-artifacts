Postcondition: ***x is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, _ is 0, i is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., i + 2) after the last iteration of the loop, ans is the maximum value of the list l which contains the maximum value of the previous list l, i, and x // i if x // i is less than or equal to k and i is less than or equal to k. If k is equal to 1, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the state of l and ans remains unchanged, and ans is printed.***
