Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even), and `l` is a list containing the values 1, 3 (if `x` is odd) or 1, 5 (if `x` is even), and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `x // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains the values 1, 3 (if `x` is odd) or 1, 5 (if `x` is even), and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it contains the values 1 and `x // i`. The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
