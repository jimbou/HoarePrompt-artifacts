Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `ans` is 1. If `k` is 1, 1 is printed and the next line of input from `stdin` will be processed. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 1. The other variables, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `_`, retain their original values and properties. The condition regarding the printing of 1 and processing of the next line of input from `stdin` when `k` is 1 remains unchanged.
