According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If the input contains at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x). So for the loop to be executed, the input must have at least 1 integer and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), `_` is 0**
