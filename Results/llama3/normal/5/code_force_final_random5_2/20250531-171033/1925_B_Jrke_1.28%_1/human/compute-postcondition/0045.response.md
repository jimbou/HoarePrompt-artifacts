To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and the range parameters. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`, which means if `x` is even, the loop starts from 2, and if `x` is odd, the loop starts from 1.
2. The loop ends at `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, which means the loop will execute until the square root of `x` (rounded down) plus 1.
3. The step size is 2, which means `i` will take on odd values.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `i` should be an odd number, and since the loop starts from 1 or 2, we can set `i` to be the next odd number in the sequence, which is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even).
* `x` should be an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, and its parity (even or odd) determines the starting value of `i`.
* The range parameters should be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. Since the loop ends at `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, we can set `x` to be at least 4 (2^2) to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even), `ans` is 1**

Note that we didn't change the states of `n`, `k`, `_`, and `ans` as they are not directly related to the loop head.
