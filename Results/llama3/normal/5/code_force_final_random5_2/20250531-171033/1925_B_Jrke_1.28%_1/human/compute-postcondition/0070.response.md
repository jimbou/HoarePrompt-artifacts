Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the previous list `l`, `i`, and `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of `i` and `x // i`. Otherwise, the state of `l` and `ans` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to the maximum value in the list `l`, which is the maximum of `i` and `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
