Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing only the value 1.**

The code only updates the list `l` by assigning it a new list containing only the value of `ans`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
