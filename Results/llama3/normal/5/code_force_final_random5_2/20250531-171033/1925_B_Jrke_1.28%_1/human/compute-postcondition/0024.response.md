Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is dependent on `x` and `i`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains the value of `ans` and `i`.***
