Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 5 (if `x` is odd) or 7 (if `x` is even), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the previous list `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to contain only the maximum value from the previous list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
