To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and understand how the variables involved in the loop head are updated.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):`

The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `x`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration (because of the `2` in the `range` function), the next value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 2.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is the next odd number in the sequence (i.e., `i + 2`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains the value of `ans` and `i`.**

Note that the states of `x`, `n`, `k`, `_`, and `ans` remain the same, as they are not updated in the loop head. Only the state of `i` is updated.
