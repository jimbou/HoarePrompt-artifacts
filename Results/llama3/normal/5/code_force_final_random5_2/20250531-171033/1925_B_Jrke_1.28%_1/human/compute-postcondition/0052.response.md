Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even), `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even) and `x // i` which is the integer division of `x` by `i`. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and `x`. The value of `k` is still an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `_` is still 1. The value of `i` is still 1 if `x` is odd, or 3 if `x` is even. The value of `ans` is still 1. The list `l` now contains three values: the value of `ans` which is 1, the value of `i` which is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even), and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, and the current value of `x` divided by `i` is still less than or equal to `k`.
