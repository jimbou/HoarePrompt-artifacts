The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 (if `x` is odd) or 3 (if `x` is even). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2). So, `i` is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even).

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even), `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l` which is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even) and `x // i` which is the integer division of `x` by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**
