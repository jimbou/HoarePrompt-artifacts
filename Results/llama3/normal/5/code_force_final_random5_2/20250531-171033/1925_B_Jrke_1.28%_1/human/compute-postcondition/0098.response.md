Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 5 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd), `ans` is 1. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 5 (if `x` is even) or 1, 3 (if `x` is odd), and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `x // i`.***
