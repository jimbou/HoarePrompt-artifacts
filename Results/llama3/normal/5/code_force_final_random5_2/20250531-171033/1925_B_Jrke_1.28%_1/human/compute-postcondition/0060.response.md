Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `_` is 1, `ans` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even), and `l` is a list containing the values 1, 3 (if `x` is odd) or 1, 5 (if `x` is even), and `x // i`. Otherwise, `i` is 3 (if `x` is odd) or 5 (if `x` is even), and `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated by appending the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still dependent on whether `x` is odd or even, and the value of `l` now includes the additional element `x // i`.
