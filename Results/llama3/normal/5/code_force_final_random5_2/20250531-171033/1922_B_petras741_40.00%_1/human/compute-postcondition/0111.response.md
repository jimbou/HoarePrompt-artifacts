Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `j` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `q` will have counted the occurrences of each integer in the list `w`, with the count of each integer `w[j]` stored in `q[w[j]]`. The variable `i` will have been increased by the number of iterations `n`, and the variable `j` will be one less than `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
