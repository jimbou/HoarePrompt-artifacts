Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index w[j] is incremented by 1 for all j in range n, stdin contains t-2 test cases, eta is a list containing all indices j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is greater than 1, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q[eta[1]] plus q[eta[j]], res is equal to rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, and if j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise j is 1.**
