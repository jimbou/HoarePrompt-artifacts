The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was an integer, its value is updated. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `w`. Since `w` was a list of integers, its value is updated. No other variables are affected. The value of `t` remains greater than 1, `i` remains 1, and `buffer` remains an empty list. Stdin now contains `t-4` test cases.

Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases**
