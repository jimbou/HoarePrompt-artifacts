Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, i is increased by n, t is greater than i, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are 0, j is 2, eta is a list containing all the values of j for which q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta and is at least 2, rho is the value of q at the index of the first element of eta plus q[eta[1]], res is the result of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho.**
