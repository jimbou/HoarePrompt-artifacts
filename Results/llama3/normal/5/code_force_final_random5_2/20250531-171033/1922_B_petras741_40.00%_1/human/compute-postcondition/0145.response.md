Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, i is increased by n, t is greater than i, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j for which q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta and is at least eta_ln, rho is the sum of all q[eta[j]] for j in range(eta_ln), res is the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the sum of all q[eta[k]] for k in range(j) for all j in range(eta_ln), and j is eta_ln - 1. If eta_ln is greater than 1000, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of res is printed**
