Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `j` is greater than 1000, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is at least 2, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index of the first element of `eta` plus `q[eta[1]]`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of `rho`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
