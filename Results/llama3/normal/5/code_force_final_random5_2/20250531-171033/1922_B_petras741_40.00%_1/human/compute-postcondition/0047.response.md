Output: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the sum of all elements in `q` at indices in `eta`, `res` is the sum of the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` in range `eta_ln`, and `j` is `eta_ln`, and the sum of the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` in range `eta_ln` is being printed**
