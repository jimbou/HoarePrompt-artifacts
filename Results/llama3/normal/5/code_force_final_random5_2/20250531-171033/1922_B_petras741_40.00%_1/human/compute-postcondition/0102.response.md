The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown, `t` is unknown. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **The program prints the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of n elements if n is greater than or equal to 3 and there is only one index j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise it prints the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the sum of q[eta[k]] for all k in range(j) for all j in range(eta_ln). If n is less than 3, it prints 0, i is increased by 1, t is greater than i**
