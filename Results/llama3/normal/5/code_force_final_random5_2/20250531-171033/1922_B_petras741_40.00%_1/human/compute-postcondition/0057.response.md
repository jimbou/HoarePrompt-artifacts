Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `q` at index `w[0]` has been incremented by 1, while the rest of the values in `q` remain 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
