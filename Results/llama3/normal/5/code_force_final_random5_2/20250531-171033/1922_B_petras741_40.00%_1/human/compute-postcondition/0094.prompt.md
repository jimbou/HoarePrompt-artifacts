Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the indices `j` in range(`n+1`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the number of indices `j` in range(`n+1`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `rho` is the number of times `w[eta[0]]` appears in `w`, `eta_ln` is larger than 1, and `res` is `rho*(rho-1)*(rho-2)//6`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), eta is a list containing all the indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]], and res is the sum of the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho. If j is greater than 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), `eta` is a list containing all the indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is at least 2, `rho` is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]] plus q[eta[j]], and `res` is the sum of the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho. If j > 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), eta is a list containing all the indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]] plus q[eta[j]], and res is the sum of the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho. If j > 1000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
