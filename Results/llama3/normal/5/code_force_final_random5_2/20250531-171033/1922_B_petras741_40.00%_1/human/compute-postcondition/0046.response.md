The code prints the value of `res`, which is the sum of the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` in range `eta_ln`. Here, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the sum of all elements in `q` at indices in `eta`, and `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in range `n`.

Output: **the sum of the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 and q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range eta_ln (where eta_ln is greater than 1, rho is the sum of all elements in q at indices in eta, and q is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index w[j] is incremented by 1 for all j in range n)**
