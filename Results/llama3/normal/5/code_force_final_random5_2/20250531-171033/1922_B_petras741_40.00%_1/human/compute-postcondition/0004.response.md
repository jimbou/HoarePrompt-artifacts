The first line assigns an empty dictionary to `q`. The second line assigns a list of `n+1` zeros to `q`. This list overwrites the previously assigned dictionary. The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, so `n+1` is at least 4. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains t-2 test cases**
