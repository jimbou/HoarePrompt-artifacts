Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `j` is `n`, stdin contains no input. `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
*   The value of `w` is a list of integers.
*   The value of `i` is increased by `n`.
*   The value of `t` is greater than `i`.
*   The value of `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0.
*   The value of `j` is `n`.
*   The stdin contains no input.
*   The value of `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0.
