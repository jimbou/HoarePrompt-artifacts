Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` which is 2, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value of `j` which is 2, as the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
