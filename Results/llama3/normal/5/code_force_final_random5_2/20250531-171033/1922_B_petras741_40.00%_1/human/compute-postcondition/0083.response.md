Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is greater than 1000, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, the current value of rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]], and the current value of res is the sum of the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho.**
