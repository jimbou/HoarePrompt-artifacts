Postcondition: **The program prints the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of n elements if n is greater than or equal to 3 and there is only one index j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise it prints the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the sum of q[eta[k]] for all k in range(j) for all j in range(eta_ln). If n is less than 3, it prints 0.**
