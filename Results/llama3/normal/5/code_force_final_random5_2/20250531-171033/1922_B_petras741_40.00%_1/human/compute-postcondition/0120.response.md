The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains no input. If the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` which is 2. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
