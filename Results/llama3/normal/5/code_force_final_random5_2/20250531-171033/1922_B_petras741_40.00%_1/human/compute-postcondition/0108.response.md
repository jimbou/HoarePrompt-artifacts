Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and `q[w[1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[1]]` has been increased by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `q` still has `n+1` integers, but now `q[w[1]]` is 1 instead of 0. The rest of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
