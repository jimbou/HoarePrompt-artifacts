Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[0]]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The rest of the elements in the list `q` remain 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
