Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, i is increased by n, t is greater than i, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are 0, j is n, eta is a list containing all the values of j for which q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta and is equal to 1, rho is the value of q at the index of the first element of eta, and there is only one value of j for which q[j] is greater than 0, and the value of n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 is being printed**
