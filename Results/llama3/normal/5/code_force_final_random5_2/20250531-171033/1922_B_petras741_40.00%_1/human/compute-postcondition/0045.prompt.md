Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in range `n`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the value of `q` at index `eta[0]`, `eta_ln` is larger than 1, and `res` is equal to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at index `eta[0]` plus `q[eta[1]]`, and `res` is equal to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. If `j` is greater than 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index w[j] is incremented by 1 for all j in range n, stdin contains t-2 test cases, eta is a list containing all indices j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is greater than 1, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q[eta[1]] plus q[eta[j]], res is equal to rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, and if j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise j is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at index `eta[0]` plus `q[eta[1]]` plus `q[eta[j]]` plus `q[eta[j]]`, `res` is equal to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and if `j` is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
