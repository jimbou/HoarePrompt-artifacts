Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` is `j+1` for `j` in range `n`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `j` is `n-1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop variable `j` reaches its final value of `n-1`. The list `q` is updated such that each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration `j` in the range `n`.
