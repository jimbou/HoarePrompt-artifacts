Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains t test cases, after this line, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The second line initializes an empty list `buffer`. No other variables are affected.
