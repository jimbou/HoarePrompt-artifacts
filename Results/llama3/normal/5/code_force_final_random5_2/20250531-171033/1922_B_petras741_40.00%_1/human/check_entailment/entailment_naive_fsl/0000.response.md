Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the line `if j > 1000: break`, which causes the program to stop iterating over the sticks after the 1000th iteration, even if there are more sticks to consider. This means that the program will not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks if there are more than 1000 sticks.

For example, if the input is `n = 1001` and `a_i = [1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`, the program will not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks, because it will stop iterating after the 1000th iteration.

To fix this issue, the program should iterate over all the sticks, without stopping at the 1000th iteration. The correct code should be:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        if n >= 3:
            q = {}
            q = [0 for j in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n):
                q[w[j]] += 1
            eta = []
            for j in range(n + 1):
                if q[j] > 0:
                    eta.append(j)
            eta_ln = len(eta)
            rho = q[eta[0]]
            if eta_ln == 1:
                print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
            else:
                res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
                for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                    rho += q[eta[j]]
                print(res)
        else:
            print(0)
```
This corrected code will correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them, for all possible inputs.
