To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

The state of `n` does not need to be changed, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `w`, `q`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 2 and the rest are 0 except the element at index `w[1]` which is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `j` is 2**
