Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, the current value of `j` is greater than 1000, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at index `eta[0]` plus `q[eta[1]]`, and `res` is equal to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
