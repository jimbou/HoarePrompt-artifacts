Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index w[j] is incremented by 1 for all j in range n, stdin contains t-2 test cases, j is n, eta is a list containing all indices j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta and is equal to 1, and rho is the value of q at index eta[0].***
