This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a given set of integers. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers, then calculates the number of combinations of 3 elements that can be chosen from the list. If n is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the total number of combinations, which is calculated by summing the combinations of 3 elements from each unique value in the list and the combinations of 2 elements from each unique value with the remaining elements.
