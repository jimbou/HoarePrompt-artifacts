Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` which is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains no input. The current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The list `w` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still increased by `n`. The value of `t` is still greater than `i`. The list `q` remains the same, where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0. The list `eta` now contains the value of `j`, which is 0. The value of `j` remains 0. There is still no input in stdin. The current value of `q[j]` is still greater than 0.
