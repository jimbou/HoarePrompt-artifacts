To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `j` is 1**
