Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If n is greater than or equal to 3, q is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index w[j] is incremented by 1 for all j in range n, eta is a list containing all indices j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, and rho is the value of q at index eta[0] if eta_ln is 1, otherwise rho is the sum of all elements in q at indices in eta. If eta_ln is 1, the number of ways to choose 3 elements from n elements is being printed, which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6. Otherwise, the sum of the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 and q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range eta_ln is being printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program prints the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of n elements if n is greater than or equal to 3 and there is only one index j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise it prints the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the sum of q[eta[k]] for all k in range(j) for all j in range(eta_ln). If n is less than 3, it prints 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, w is a list of integers, i is increased by 1, t is greater than i, stdin contains no input. If n is less than 3, then 0 is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 3, then i is increased by n, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are 0, j is n, eta is a list containing all the values of j for which q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta, rho is the value of q at the index of the first element of eta. If eta_ln is equal to 1, then there is only one value of j for which q[j] is greater than 0 and the value of n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 is being printed. If eta_ln is greater than 1, then rho is the sum of all q[eta[j]] for j in range(eta_ln), res is the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the sum of all q[eta[k]] for k in range(j) for all j in range(eta_ln), and j is eta_ln - 1. If eta_ln is greater than 1000, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of res is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
