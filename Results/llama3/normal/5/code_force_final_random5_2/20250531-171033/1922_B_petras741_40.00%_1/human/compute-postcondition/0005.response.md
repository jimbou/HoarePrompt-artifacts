To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already stated to be an integer greater than or equal to 3, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure the loop can execute.

Since `j` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `j` is 0**
