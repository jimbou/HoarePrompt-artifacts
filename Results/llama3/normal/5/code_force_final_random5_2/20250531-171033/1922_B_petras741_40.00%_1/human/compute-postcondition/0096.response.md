Output: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), eta is a list containing all the indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 1, rho is the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range(eta_ln), and res is the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the sum of q[eta[k]] for all k in range(j) for all j in range(eta_ln), and the value of res is being printed**
