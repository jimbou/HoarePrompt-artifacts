Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), `eta` is a list containing all the indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is at least 2, `rho` is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]] plus q[eta[j]], and `res` is the sum of the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
