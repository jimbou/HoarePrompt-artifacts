Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `w`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `buffer` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2.
