Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in range `n`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `j` is 0, and `eta` is a list containing 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list.***
