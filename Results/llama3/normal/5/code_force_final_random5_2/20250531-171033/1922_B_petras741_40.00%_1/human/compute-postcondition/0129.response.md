Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is greater than 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index of the first element of `eta`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still valid, and a new variable `res` has been added. The value of `res` is calculated based on the value of `q[eta[0]]`, which is the number of occurrences of the first element of `eta` in `w`. The expression `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6` calculates the result of this combination, which is stored in the variable `res`.
