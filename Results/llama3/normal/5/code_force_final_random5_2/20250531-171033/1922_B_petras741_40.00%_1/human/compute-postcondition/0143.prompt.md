Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is greater than 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index of the first element of `eta`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is at least 2, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index of the first element of `eta` plus `q[eta[1]]`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of `rho`. If `j` is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is at least 3, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index of the first element of `eta` plus `q[eta[1]]` plus `q[eta[2]]`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of `rho` plus `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 times the updated value of `rho`, and if `j` is greater than 1000, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `j` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, i is increased by n, t is greater than i, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j for which q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta and is at least 4, rho is the value of q at the index of the first element of eta plus q[eta[1]] plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]], res is the result of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of rho plus q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 times the updated value of rho plus q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 times the updated value of rho, and j is 3. If j > 1000, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
