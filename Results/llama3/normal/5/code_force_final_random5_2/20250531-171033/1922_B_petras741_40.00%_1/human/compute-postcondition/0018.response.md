To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `w`, `q`, `stdin`, and `eta`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in range `n`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list containing 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list.**
