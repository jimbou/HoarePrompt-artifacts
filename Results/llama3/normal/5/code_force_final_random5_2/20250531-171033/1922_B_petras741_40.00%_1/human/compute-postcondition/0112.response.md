Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the variable `eta` has been assigned an empty list, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `w` is still a list of integers, `i` is still increased by `n`, `t` is still greater than `i`, `q` is still a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `j` is still `n-1`, and stdin still contains no input.
