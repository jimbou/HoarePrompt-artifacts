Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If n is greater than or equal to 3, q is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index w[j] is incremented by 1 for all j in range n, eta is a list containing all indices j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, and rho is the value of q at index eta[0] if eta_ln is 1, otherwise rho is the sum of all elements in q at indices in eta. If eta_ln is 1, the number of ways to choose 3 elements from n elements is being printed, which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6. Otherwise, the sum of the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 and q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range eta_ln is being printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is being printed.***
