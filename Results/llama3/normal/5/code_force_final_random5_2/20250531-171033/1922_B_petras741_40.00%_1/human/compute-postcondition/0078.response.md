Output: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is n, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, the current value of eta_ln is 1, and the current value of rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w, and this is printed: n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 which is the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of n elements**
