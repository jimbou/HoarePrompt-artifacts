Output State: **n is an integer, w is a list of integers, i is increased by 1, t is greater than i, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the value of `n` is now an integer, which was assigned from the input. The list `w` contains integers, which were also assigned from the input. The variable `i` has been increased by 1, and `t` remains greater than `i`. The stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been read.
