To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `eta_ln`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `eta_ln`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `eta_ln`.

Since `eta_ln` is at least 2, we can conclude that `eta_ln` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `w`, `i`, `t`, `q`, `eta`, and `res`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `i` is increased by `n`, `t` is greater than `i`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is at least 3, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index of the first element of `eta` plus `q[eta[1]]`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 times the original value of `rho`, `j` is 2**
