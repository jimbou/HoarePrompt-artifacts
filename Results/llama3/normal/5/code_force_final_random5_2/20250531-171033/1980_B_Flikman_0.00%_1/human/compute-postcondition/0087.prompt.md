Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the f-th element of a, same_value_count is 0, greater_count is the number of elements in a that are greater than favorite_value.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is 1 if the first element of `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` is 0, `greater_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and the current value of `value` is equal to the first element of `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `greater_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and the current value of `value` is equal to the second element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 2, otherwise `same_value_count` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `greater_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and the current value of `value` is equal to the third element of `a`. If the third element of `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 4, otherwise `same_value_count` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
