State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is an integer equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `a`, `greater_count` is an integer equal to the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value` is greater than or equal to `k`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.**
