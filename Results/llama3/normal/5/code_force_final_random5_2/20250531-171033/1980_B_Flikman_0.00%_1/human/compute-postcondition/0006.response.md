Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `stdin` is empty. If the first element in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0.***
