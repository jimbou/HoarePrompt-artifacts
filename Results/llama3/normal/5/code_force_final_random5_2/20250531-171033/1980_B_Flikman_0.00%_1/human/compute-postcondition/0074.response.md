Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the f-th element of a, same_value_count is the number of times favorite_value appears in a, greater_count is the number of elements in a that are greater than favorite_value. If greater_count is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. If greater_count is less than k, then if the sum of greater_count and same_value_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.***
