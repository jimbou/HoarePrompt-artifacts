Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is an integer equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `a`, `value` is the second element in the list `a`, `greater_count` is an integer equal to 1 if the value of `value` is greater than the value of `favorite_value`, otherwise `greater_count` is an integer equal to 1.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still present and have the same properties, except for `greater_count`. The value of `greater_count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1 if the value of `value` is greater than the value of `favorite_value`, otherwise it is still 1.
