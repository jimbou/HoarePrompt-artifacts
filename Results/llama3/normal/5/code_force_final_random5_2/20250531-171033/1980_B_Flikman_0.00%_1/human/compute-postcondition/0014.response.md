Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is an integer equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `a`, `greater_count` is an integer equal to 0, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` remains the same as in the initial state. The variable `greater_count` is assigned the value 0. The `stdin` remains empty.
