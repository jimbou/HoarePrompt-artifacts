Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is an integer equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `a`, `value` is the second element in the list `a`. If the value of `value` is greater than the value of `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is an integer equal to 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` is an integer equal to 0.***
