Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the `f`-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, and `value` is the first element of `a`. If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` remains 0.***
