Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each case based on the comparison of the number of elements greater than a favorite value and a given threshold. It iterates through the input, extracts relevant information, and performs conditional checks to determine the output for each test case.**
