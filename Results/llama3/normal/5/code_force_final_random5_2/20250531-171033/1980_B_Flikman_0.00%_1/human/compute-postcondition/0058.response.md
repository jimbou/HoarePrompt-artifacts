Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `a`, `value` is the second element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is greater than the f-th element of `a`, then `greater_count` is 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` is 0.***
