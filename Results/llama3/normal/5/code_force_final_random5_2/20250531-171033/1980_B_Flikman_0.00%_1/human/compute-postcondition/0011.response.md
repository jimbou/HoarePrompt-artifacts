Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `value` is the third element of `a`, `same_value_count` is either 2 or 3. If the third element in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 3. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. If the third element in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is now 3. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
