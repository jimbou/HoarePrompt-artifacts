To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range it's iterating over, which is `t`).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), we can adjust the state to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**
