Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the f-th element of a, same_value_count is the number of times favorite_value appears in a, greater_count is 0
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value > favorite_value:
        greater_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `a`. If the first element of `a` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 1 and `value` is the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `greater_count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `a`, `value` is the second element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is greater than the f-th element of `a`, then `greater_count` is 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `a`, `value` is the third element of `a`. If the third element of `a` is greater than the f-th element of `a`, then `greater_count` is 2. Otherwise, `greater_count` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
