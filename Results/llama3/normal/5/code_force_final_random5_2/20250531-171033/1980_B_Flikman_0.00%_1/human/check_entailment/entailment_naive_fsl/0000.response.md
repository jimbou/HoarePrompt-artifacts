Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. It first finds the value of the favorite cube, then counts the number of cubes with the same value and the number of cubes with greater values. Based on these counts, it determines whether the favorite cube will be removed or not.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If the number of cubes with greater values is greater than or equal to k, the favorite cube will be removed, and the program prints 'YES'.
* If the number of cubes with greater values plus the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is less than or equal to k, the favorite cube will not be removed, and the program prints 'NO'.
* In all other cases, the favorite cube may or may not be removed, and the program prints 'MAYBE'.

The program correctly handles the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes, and it correctly handles the case where the favorite cube is the only cube with its value.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
