Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the `f`-th element of `a`, `value` is the second element in the list. If the `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 2. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 1. The value of `greater_count` is not defined.***
