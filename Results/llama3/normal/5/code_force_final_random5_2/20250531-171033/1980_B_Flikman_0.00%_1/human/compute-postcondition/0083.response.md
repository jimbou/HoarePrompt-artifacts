Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the f-th element of `a`, `greater_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and the current value of `value` is equal to the second element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 2, otherwise `same_value_count` is 1.***
