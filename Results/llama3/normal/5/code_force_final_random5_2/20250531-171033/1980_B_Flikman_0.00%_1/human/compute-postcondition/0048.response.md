Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the `f`-th element of `a`, `value` is the third element in the list. If the `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 4. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 3. The value of `greater_count` is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. If the `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is now 4, otherwise it is 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
