#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: t is an integer equal to 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the f-th element of a, same_value_count is the number of elements in a that are equal to favorite_value, greater_count is the number of elements in a that are greater than favorite_value, and value is equal to the last element of a. If greater_count is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of greater_count and same_value_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each case based on the comparison of the number of elements greater than a favorite value and a given threshold. It iterates through the input, extracts relevant information, and performs conditional checks to determine the output for each test case.
