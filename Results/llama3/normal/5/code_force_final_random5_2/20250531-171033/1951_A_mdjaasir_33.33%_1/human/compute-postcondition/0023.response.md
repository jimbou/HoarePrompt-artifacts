Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and count is not equal to 0. If count is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2, 'YES' is printed if the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If count is less than 2 or is not divisible by 2, 'NO' is printed.***
