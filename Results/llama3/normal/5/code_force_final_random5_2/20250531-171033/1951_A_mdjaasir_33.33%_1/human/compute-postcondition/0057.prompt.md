Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one input: a binary string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2, 'YES' is printed if the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If count is less than 2 or is not divisible by 2, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, i is 1, n is an integer, a is a binary string, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the count of '1's in a is 0, 'YES' is printed. If the count of '1's in a is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If the count of '1's in a is 2 and the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, i is 2, n is an integer, a is a binary string, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If count is 0, 'YES' is being printed. If count is greater than 2 and count is even, 'YES' is being printed. If count is 2 and the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
