Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer and a binary string of the same length. It then checks the number of '1's in the binary string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if there are no '1's, if there are more than two '1's and the count is even, or if there are exactly two '1's and they are not consecutive. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
