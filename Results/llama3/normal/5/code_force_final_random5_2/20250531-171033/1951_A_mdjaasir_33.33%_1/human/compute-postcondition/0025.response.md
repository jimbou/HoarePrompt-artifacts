To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string, `count` is the number of '1's in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `count` is 0, 'YES' is printed. If `count` is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If `count` is 2, 'YES' is printed if the first '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `count` is less than 2 or is not divisible by 2, 'NO' is printed.**
