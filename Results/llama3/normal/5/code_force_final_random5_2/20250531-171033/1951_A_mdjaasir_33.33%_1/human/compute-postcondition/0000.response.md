The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer and a binary string. The first input, an integer, is accepted and assigned to `t`. The integer is a positive integer less than or equal to 50. The second input, a binary string, is still in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one input: a binary string.**
