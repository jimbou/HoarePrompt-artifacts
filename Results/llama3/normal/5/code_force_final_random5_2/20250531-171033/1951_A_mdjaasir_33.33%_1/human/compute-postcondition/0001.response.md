According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50 and stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one input: a binary string. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one input: a binary string, `i` is 0**
