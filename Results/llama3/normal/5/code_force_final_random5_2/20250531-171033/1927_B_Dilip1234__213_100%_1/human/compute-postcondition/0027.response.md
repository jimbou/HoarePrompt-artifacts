Postcondition: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 containing all lowercase English letters, char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[j] is equal to a[i] and is 2, and char_count[k] is 1 for all k != j, i is 2, and j is at least 0 and less than 26, and the current value of char_count[j] is equal to a[i].**
