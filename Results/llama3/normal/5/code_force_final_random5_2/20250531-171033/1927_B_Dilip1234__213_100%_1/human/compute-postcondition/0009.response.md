According to the code, the loop head is `for j in range(26):`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i. If char_count[j] equals a[i], then s is a string of length 2 containing the characters 'a' and 'b', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is 1 and char_count[1] is 1, i is 0, j is 2.**
