According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 25, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than 26. The variable `i` is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, `s` is a string of length 26 containing all lowercase English letters, `char_count` is a list of 26 ones, `i` is 1, `j` is less than 26**
