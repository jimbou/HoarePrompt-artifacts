Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is 1 and char_count[1] is 1, i is 0, j is 2. If char_count[j] equals a[i], then s is a string of length 3 containing the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', and char_count[2] is 2. Otherwise, s is a string of length 2 containing the characters 'a' and 'b'.***
