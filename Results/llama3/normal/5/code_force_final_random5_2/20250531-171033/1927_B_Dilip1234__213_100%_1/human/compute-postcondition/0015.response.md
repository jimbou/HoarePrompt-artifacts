Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= `a_i` < `n` for all `i`, `s` is a string of length 26 containing all lowercase English letters, `char_count` is a list of 26 ones, `i` is 1, `j` is less than 26, and the current value of `char_count[j]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**
