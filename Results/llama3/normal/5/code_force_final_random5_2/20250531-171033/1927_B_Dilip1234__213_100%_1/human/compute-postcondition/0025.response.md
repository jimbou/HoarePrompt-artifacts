The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 containing all lowercase English letters, char_count is a list of 26 integers where if char_count[j] is equal to a[i], then char_count[j] is 2 and char_count[k] is 1 for all k != j, otherwise char_count remains a list of 26 ones, i is 2, j is 25**
