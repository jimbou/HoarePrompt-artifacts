Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, if char_count[j] equals a[i], then s is a string of length 1 containing the character 'a', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is incremented by 1, i is 0, j is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
