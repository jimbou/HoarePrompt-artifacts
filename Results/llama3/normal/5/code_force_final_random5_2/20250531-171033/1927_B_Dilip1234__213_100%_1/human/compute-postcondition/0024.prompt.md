Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 containing all lowercase English letters, char_count is a list of 26 ones, i is 1, j is 25
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 containing all lowercase English letters, char_count is a list of 26 integers where if char_count[j] is equal to a[i], then char_count[j] is 2 and char_count[k] is 1 for all k != j, otherwise char_count remains a list of 26 ones, i is 1, j is less than 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 containing all lowercase English letters, char_count is a list of 26 integers where if char_count[j] is equal to a[i], then char_count[j] is 3 and char_count[k] is 1 for all k != j, otherwise char_count remains a list of 26 ones, i is 1, j is less than 27

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 containing all lowercase English letters, char_count is a list of 26 integers where if char_count[j] is equal to a[i], then char_count[j] is 2 and char_count[k] is 1 for all k != j, otherwise char_count remains a list of 26 ones, i is 1, j is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
