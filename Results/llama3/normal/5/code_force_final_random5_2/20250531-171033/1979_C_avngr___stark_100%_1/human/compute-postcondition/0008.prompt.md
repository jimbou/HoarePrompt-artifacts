Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numbers` is a list of integers, where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and `result` is an integer equal to the first element of the `numbers` list.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers[1:]:
    result = func_1(result, num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with the first and second elements of the `numbers` list as arguments, `num` is the second element of the `numbers` list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with the value returned by `func_1` when called with the first and second elements of the `numbers` list as arguments and the third element of the `numbers` list as arguments, `num` is the third element of the `numbers` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with the value returned by `func_1` when called with the value returned by `func_1` when called with the first and second elements of the `numbers` list as arguments and the third element of the `numbers` list as arguments and the fourth element of the `numbers` list as arguments, `num` is the fourth element of the `numbers` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
