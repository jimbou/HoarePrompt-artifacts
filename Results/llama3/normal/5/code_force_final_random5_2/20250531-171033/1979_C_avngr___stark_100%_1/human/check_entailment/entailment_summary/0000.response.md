Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the absolute value of the product of two positive integers divided by their greatest common divisor. `func_2` takes a list of integers as input, where each integer represents a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning. It then iteratively applies `func_1` to the first element of the list and each subsequent element, returning the final result.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome. It then calls `func_2` to compute a cumulative result, which is used to calculate the amount of coins to bet on each outcome. If the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the cumulative result, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of `func_1` and `func_2` is appropriate, and the main part of the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
