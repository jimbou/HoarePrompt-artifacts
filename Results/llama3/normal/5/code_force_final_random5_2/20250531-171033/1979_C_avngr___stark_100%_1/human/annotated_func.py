#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input, where each integer represents a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning. It then iteratively applies the function `func_1` to the first element of the list and each subsequent element, returning the final result. The function does not modify the input list. The purpose of the function is to compute a cumulative result by applying `func_1` to the elements of the input list in a specific order.
