Correctness: **False**.

The program is trying to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program does not actually solve this problem. It defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the least common multiple of two numbers and the least common multiple of a list of numbers, respectively. But it does not use these functions to solve the problem.

The program is missing the logic to distribute the coins based on the multipliers `k_i` and to check if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

For example, if the input is `n = 3` and `k_1 = 3, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 7`, the program should output `27 41 12` as the bets on the outcomes, but it does not. Instead, it does not output anything.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
