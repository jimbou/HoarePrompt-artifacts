Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining how to distribute coins in a game with n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The given program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to calculate the bets for each outcome.

Func_1 calculates the absolute value of the product of two positive integers divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). This function is used in func_2 to iteratively compute a cumulative result by applying func_1 to the elements of the input list in a specific order.

Func_2 takes a list of integers as input, where each integer represents a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning. It then iteratively applies func_1 to the first element of the list and each subsequent element, returning the final result.

The main program uses func_2 to calculate the bets for each outcome and checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If the condition is met, it prints the bets for each outcome; otherwise, it prints -1.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the given program is correct. It correctly calculates the bets for each outcome and checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
