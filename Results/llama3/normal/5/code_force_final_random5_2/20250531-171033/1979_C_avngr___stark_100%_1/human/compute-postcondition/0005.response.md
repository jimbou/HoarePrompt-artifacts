To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]:`. This means we are iterating over the elements of the `numbers` list, starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the list.


At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the third element of the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute again, `num` should be the next element in the list, which is the fourth element.


The state of `numbers` should remain the same, as it is not modified in the loop head. The state of `result` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.


Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:


State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with the value returned by `func_1` when called with the first and second elements of the `numbers` list as arguments and the third element of the `numbers` list as arguments, `num` is the fourth element of the `numbers` list**
