To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `numbers`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `numbers`. If `numbers` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `result` is the first element of the `numbers` list, `num` is the second element of the `numbers` list**
