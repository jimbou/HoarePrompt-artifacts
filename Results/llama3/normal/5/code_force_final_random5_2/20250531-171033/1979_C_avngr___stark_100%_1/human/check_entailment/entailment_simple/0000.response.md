Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`. It then calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2` and stores it in `m`. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing `m` by the corresponding multiplier and stores them in `c`.

If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets for each outcome. The use of the LCM ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
