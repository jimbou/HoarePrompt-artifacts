Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with the value returned by `func_1` when called with the first and second elements of the `numbers` list as arguments and the third element of the `numbers` list as arguments, `num` is the third element of the `numbers` list**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `result` and the third element of the `numbers` list as arguments. The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.
