Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine how to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The provided program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor. `func_2` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the first number and each subsequent number in the list.

The main logic of the program is not shown, but based on the problem description and the provided functions, it is likely that the program uses `func_2` to calculate the LCM of the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome. The LCM represents the smallest amount that can be bet on each outcome such that the total amount bet is a multiple of each `k_i`.

To determine if the program is correct, we need to check if the calculated LCM is indeed the smallest amount that satisfies the condition. If the LCM is not the smallest amount, then the program is incorrect.

However, without the main logic of the program, we cannot directly verify its correctness. Nevertheless, based on the provided functions and the problem description, it appears that the program is designed to solve the problem correctly.

Therefore, assuming the main logic of the program is implemented correctly, the provided functions seem to be correct, and the program should produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
