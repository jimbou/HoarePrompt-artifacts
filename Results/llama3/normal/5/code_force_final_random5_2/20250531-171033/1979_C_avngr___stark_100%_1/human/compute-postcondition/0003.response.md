The only object in the loop head is variable  num and list  numbers, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list numbers.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, numbers has at least 2 elements, num is the second element of the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the num is the trird element of the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with the first and second elements of the `numbers` list as arguments, `num` is the third element of the `numbers` list**
