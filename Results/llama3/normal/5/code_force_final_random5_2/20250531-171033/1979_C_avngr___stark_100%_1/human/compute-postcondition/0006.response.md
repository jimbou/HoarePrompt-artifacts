Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when called with the value returned by `func_1` when called with the value returned by `func_1` when called with the first and second elements of the `numbers` list as arguments and the third element of the `numbers` list as arguments and the fourth element of the `numbers` list as arguments, `num` is the fourth element of the `numbers` list**

In natural language, the output state is that the `numbers` list remains unchanged, the `num` variable remains unchanged as the fourth element of the `numbers` list, and the `result` variable is updated to be the value returned by `func_1` when called with the previous value of `result` (which was the value returned by `func_1` when called with the value returned by `func_1` when called with the first and second elements of the `numbers` list as arguments and the third element of the `numbers` list as arguments) and the fourth element of the `numbers` list as arguments.
