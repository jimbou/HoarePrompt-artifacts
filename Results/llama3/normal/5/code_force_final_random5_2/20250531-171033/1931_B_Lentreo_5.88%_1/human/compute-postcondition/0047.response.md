The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 2 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, if the second element in the list is not equal to 0, `curr` is `i - last`, otherwise `curr` is 0, and `i` is the second element in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
