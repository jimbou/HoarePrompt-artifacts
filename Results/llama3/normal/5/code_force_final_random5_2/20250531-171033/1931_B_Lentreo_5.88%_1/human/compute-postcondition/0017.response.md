Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums. If all elements in nums are not equal to 0, curr is set to the sum of all elements in nums minus the last element of nums multiplied by the number of elements in nums minus one. Otherwise, curr is set to 0. curr is not equal to 0***
