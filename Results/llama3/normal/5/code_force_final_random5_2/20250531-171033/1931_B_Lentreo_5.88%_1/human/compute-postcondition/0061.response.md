Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer equal to the value of the last test case, nums is an empty list, last is an integer equal to the last element of the last test case, curr is the sum of all non-zero elements in the list minus the last element of the list multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in the list, and i is the last element in the list. If curr is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The stdin will be empty, as all test cases have been read. The variables n, nums, last, curr, and i will retain their values from the last test case. The loop will print 'YES' if the sum of all non-zero elements in the list minus the last element of the list multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in the list is 0, and 'NO' otherwise.
