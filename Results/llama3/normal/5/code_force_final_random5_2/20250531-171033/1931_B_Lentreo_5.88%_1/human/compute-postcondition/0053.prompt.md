Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, nums is a list of integers from the third test case, last is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, curr is 0, i is the last element in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 1 integer, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, if the first element in the list is not equal to 0, `curr` is `i - last`, otherwise `curr` is 0, and `i` is the first element in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 2 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, if the second element in the list is not equal to 0, `curr` is 2 * (i - last), otherwise `curr` is 0, and `i` is the second element in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 3 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the third test case, `i` is the third element in the list. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is 3 * (i - last), otherwise `curr` is 0, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
