Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 1 integer, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, if the first element in the list is not equal to 0, `curr` is `i - last`, otherwise `curr` is 0, and `i` is the first element in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases.***
