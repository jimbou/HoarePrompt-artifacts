Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case. If the second element of the first test case is not equal to 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case if the third element is not equal to 0. If the second element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case if the third element is not equal to 0. If the first element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case if the third element is not equal to 0. If the third element is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case if the second element is not equal to 0. If the first element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case. `i` is the third element in the list.***
