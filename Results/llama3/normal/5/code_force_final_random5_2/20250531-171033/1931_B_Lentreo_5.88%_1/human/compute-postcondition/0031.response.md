Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case. If the second element of the first test case is not equal to 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case. If the second element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case. If the first element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case. `i` is the third element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the third element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the stdin now contains one less test case.
