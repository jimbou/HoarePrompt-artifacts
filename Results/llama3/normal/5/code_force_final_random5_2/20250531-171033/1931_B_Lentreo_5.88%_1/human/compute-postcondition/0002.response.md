Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums, curr is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, as one test case has been processed. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the input. The variable `nums` is assigned a list of integers from the input. The variable `last` is assigned the value of the last element of the list `nums`. The variable `curr` is initialized to 0.
