Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the list minus the last element of the list multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in the list, `i` is the last element in the list, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `nums` is empty, and the variable `curr` has accumulated the sum of all non-zero elements in the list minus the last element of the list multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
