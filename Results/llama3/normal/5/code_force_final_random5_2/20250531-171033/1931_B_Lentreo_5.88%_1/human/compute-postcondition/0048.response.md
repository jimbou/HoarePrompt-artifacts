Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 2 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, `curr` is 2 * (i - last), `i` is the second element in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to `2 * (i - last)`, which is the result of adding `i - last` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
