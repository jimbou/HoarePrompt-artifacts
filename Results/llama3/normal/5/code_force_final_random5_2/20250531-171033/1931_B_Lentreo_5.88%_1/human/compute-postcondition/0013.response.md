Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums. If all elements in nums are not equal to 0, curr is set to the sum of all elements in nums minus the last element of nums multiplied by the number of elements in nums minus one. Otherwise, curr is set to 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `stdin`, `n`, and `nums` as in the initial state. The value of `last` will still be the last element of `nums`. The value of `curr` will be the sum of all elements in `nums` minus the last element of `nums` multiplied by the number of elements in `nums` minus one, but only if all elements in `nums` are not equal to 0. If any element in `nums` is 0, `curr` will be 0.
