Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the list of water containers from left to right. It keeps track of the total amount of water that needs to be poured from the current container to the last container (curr). If the current container has more water than the last container, it adds the difference to curr. If curr is 0 at the end, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows pouring water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j. This means that we can pour water from a container to any container to its right, not just to the last container. The given program does not take this into account.

For example, consider the input [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]. The program will calculate curr as (4-3) + (5-3) + (2-3) + (1-3) = 0, and print 'YES'. However, it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, because we cannot pour water from the first container to the second container, and then from the second container to the third container, and so on.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
