Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case. It correctly calculates the sum of all non-zero elements in the list minus the last element of the list multiplied by the number of non-zero elements, and prints 'YES' if the result is zero, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. The comments provided in the code accurately describe the state of the program before and after the function call, and the overall functionality of the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is:

Correctness: **True**
