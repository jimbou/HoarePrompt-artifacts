Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, nums is a list of integers from the third test case, last is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, curr is 0, i is the last element in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to the value of the third test case, as the first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The value of `nums` is updated to be a list of integers from the third test case, as the second line of the code assigns the list of integers from the input to `nums`. The value of `last` is updated to be equal to the last element of the third test case, as the third line of the code assigns the last element of `nums` to `last`. The value of `curr` is updated to be 0, as the fourth line of the code assigns 0 to `curr`. The value of `i` is updated to be the last element in the list, as the fifth line of the code assigns the last element of `nums` to `i`. The value of stdin is updated to contain t-3 test cases, as two test cases have been consumed by the code.
