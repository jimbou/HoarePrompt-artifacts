The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the second test case, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the second test case, `curr` is equal to the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in the second test case and the last element of the second test case, and `i` is the last element in the list. If `curr` is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
