The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case, if the first element of the first test case is not equal to 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case, otherwise `curr` is 0, and `i` is the second element in the list.**
