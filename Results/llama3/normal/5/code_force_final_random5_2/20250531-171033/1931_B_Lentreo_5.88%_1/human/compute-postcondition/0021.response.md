The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t test cases, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums. If the sum of all elements in nums minus the last element of nums multiplied by the number of elements in nums minus one equals 0, or all elements in nums are equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
