Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, `curr` is `i - last`, and `i` is the first element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to be the difference between the first element `i` and the last element `last` of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
