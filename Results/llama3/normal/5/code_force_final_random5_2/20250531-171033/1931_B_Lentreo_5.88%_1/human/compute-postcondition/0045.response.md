Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 1 integer, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, `curr` is `i - last`, and `i` is the first element in the list, which is not equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `curr` has been updated to be the difference between the first element `i` and the last element `last` of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
