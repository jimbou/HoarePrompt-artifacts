To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is 0. For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 1 element and `i` is now the first element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, `curr` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list**
