Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The program only checks if the sum of the differences between each container's water amount and the last container's water amount is zero. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "NO", but it's actually possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the third container to the first and second containers.

A correct solution would involve checking if the prefix sum of the water amounts is always greater than or equal to the average water amount times the current index. This ensures that it's possible to pour water from the current container to the previous containers to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
