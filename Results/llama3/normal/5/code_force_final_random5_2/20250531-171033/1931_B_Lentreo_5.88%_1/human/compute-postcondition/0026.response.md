Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case, if the first element of the first test case is not equal to 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case, otherwise `curr` is 0, and `i` is the first element in the list.***
