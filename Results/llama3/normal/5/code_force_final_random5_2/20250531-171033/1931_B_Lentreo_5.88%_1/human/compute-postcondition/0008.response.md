Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, `i` is the second element in the list, `curr` is set to `2*i - 2*last`.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to `2*i - 2*last` because `curr` was initially set to `i - last` and then incremented by `i - last` again. The other variables remain unchanged.
