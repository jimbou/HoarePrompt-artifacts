The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, `i` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, `i` is the second element in the list. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is set to `i - last`.**
