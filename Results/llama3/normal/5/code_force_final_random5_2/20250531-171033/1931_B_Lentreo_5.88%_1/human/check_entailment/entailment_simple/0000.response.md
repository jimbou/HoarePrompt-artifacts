Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's why:

*   The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
*   For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
*   It then calculates the last element of the list `last` and initializes a variable `curr` to 0.
*   The program then iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`. If `i` is not 0, it adds `i - last` to `curr`. This effectively calculates the total amount of water that needs to be moved from the containers to the last container to make all containers have the same amount of water.
*   If `curr` is 0, it means that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by moving water from the containers to the last container. In this case, the program prints 'YES'.
*   If `curr` is not 0, it means that it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by moving water from the containers to the last container. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the described operation.

Correctness: **True**
