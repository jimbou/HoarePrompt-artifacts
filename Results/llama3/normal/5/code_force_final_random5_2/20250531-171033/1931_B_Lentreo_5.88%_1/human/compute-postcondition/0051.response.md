Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 3 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the third test case, `i` is the third element in the list, `curr` is 3 * (i - last) if the third element in the list is not equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is 0, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `curr` has been updated by adding the difference between the third element `i` and the second last element `last` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `curr` is now three times the difference between `i` and `last` if `i` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains 0.
