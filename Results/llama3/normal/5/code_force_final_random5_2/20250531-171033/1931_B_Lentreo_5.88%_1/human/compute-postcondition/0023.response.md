The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case, `curr` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case, `curr` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list**
