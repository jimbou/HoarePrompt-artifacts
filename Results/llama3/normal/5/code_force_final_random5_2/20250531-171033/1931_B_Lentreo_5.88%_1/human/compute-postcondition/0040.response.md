Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case, `curr` is equal to the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in the first test case and the last element of the first test case, and `i` is the last element in the list. If `curr` is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
