Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is a list of integers from the third test case that must have at least 3 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the third test case, `i` is the third element in the list. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is 3 * (i - last), otherwise `curr` is 0, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.***
