To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in nums:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element in the list, and `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0.
* `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-1` test cases.
* `n` remains unchanged, an integer.
* `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
* `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, which is now the third element in the list.
* `i` is the third element in the list.
* If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is set to `2*i - 2*last`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, `i` is the third element in the list, `curr` is set to `2*i - 2*last` if `i` is not equal to 0**
