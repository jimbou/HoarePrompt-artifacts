Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, nums is a list of integers equal to the first test case, last is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case, curr is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case, if the first element of the first test case is not equal to 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case, otherwise `curr` is 0, and `i` is the first element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case. If the second element of the first test case is not equal to 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case. If the second element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case. If the first element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case. `i` is the second element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is a list of integers equal to the first test case that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case. If the second element of the first test case is not equal to 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case if the third element is not equal to 0. If the second element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case if the third element is not equal to 0. If the first element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the third element and the last element of the first test case if the third element is not equal to 0. If the third element is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the first element of the first test case and the last element of the first test case plus the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case if the second element is not equal to 0. If the first element of the first test case is 0, `curr` is equal to the difference between the second element and the last element of the first test case. `i` is the third element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
