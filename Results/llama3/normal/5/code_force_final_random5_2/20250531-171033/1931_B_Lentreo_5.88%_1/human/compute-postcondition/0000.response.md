Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The values of the other variables are not affected.
