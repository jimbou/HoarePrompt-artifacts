Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program only checks if the sum of all non-zero elements in the list minus the last element of the list multiplied by the number of non-zero elements is zero. This does not accurately represent the problem's requirements.

The program does not correctly implement the operation of pouring water from one container to another. It only checks if the sum of the differences between each element and the last element is zero, which is not sufficient to determine if the containers can be made equal.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where the sum of the elements is not divisible by the number of containers, which is a requirement stated in the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
