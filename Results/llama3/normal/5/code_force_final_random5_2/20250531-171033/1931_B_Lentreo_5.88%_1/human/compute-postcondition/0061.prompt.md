Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    last = nums[-1]
    curr = 0
    for i in nums:
        if i != 0:
            curr += i - last
    if curr == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums. If the sum of all elements in nums minus the last element of nums multiplied by the number of elements in nums minus one equals 0, or all elements in nums are equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the first test case, `curr` is equal to the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in the first test case and the last element of the first test case, and `i` is the last element in the list. If `curr` is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of the third test case, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the third test case, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the list minus the last element of the list multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in the list, `i` is the last element in the list, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If `curr` is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
