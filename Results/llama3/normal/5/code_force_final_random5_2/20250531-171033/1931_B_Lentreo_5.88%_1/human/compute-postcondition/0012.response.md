Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, `i` is the third element in the list. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is set to `2*i - 2*last + i - last`.***
