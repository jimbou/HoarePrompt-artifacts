Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, _ is 1, a is a 4x4 matrix of integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x**

The code block reassigns the values of `a`, `x`, and `dx`. The first line reads a 4x4 matrix of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The second line extracts the first column of `a` and assigns it to `x`. The third line calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` and assigns it to `dx`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
