The code prints the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. Since the exact values in the list `x` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `dx`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
