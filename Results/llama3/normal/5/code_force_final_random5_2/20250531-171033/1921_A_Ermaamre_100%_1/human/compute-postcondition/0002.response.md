Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, _ is 0, a is a 4x4 matrix of integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not used or modified in the code. The code creates a 4x4 matrix `a` of integers by reading input from stdin, which is now empty. The list `x` is created by extracting the first element of each row in the matrix `a`, resulting in a list of 4 integers. The variable `dx` is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, resulting in an integer value.
