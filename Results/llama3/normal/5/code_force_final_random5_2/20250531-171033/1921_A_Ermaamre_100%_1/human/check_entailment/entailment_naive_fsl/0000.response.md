Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which represents the length of the side of the square, and then squaring it.

The program assumes that the input coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, which is guaranteed by the problem statement. It also assumes that the area of the square is positive, which is also guaranteed.

The program uses a list comprehension to extract the x-coordinates from the input points, and then uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. The difference between these two values is the length of the side of the square, which is then squared to give the area.

The program does not contain any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. It correctly handles the case where the input points are not in any particular order, and it correctly calculates the area of the square even if the points are not aligned with the coordinate axes.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
