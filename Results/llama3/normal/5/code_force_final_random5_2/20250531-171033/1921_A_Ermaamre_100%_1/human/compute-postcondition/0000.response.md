Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t testcases. Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` has been assigned an integer value between 1 and 100, which represents the number of testcases. The stdin still contains the same testcases, each consisting of four lines with two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The values of the other variables are not affected.
