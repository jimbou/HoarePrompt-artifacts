Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, _ is t-1, a is a 4x4 matrix of integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x, and the square of dx is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, with the loop counter `_` reaching its final value of `t-1`. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` still hold their respective values, which are the last values they were assigned during the loop's execution. The square of `dx` is being printed, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration and is now printing the result.
