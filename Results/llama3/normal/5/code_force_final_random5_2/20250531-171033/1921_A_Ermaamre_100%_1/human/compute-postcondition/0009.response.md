The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1, so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a 4x4 matrix of integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x**
