To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same.

The other variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers, `x` is a list of 4 integers, `dx` is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`**
