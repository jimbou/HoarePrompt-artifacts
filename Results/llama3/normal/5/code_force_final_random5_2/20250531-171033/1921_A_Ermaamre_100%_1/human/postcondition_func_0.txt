This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of a square's corners. For each test case, it calculates the side length of the square (as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates) and prints the square of this side length. The function processes a specified number of test cases, which is provided as the first input.
