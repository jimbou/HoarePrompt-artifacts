To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable in this case, but still part of the loop head).

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 100, we can conclude that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so we don't need to assign a specific value to it. However, we can infer that `_` will take on the value of the current iteration, starting from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `_` is 0**
