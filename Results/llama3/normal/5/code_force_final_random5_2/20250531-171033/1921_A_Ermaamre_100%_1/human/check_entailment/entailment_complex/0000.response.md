Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, which is between 1 and 100.
2. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates from the input and stores them in the list `x`.
4. It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`).
5. It prints the square of the side length (`dx * dx`), which is the area of the square.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of list comprehensions and the `max` and `min` functions makes the code concise and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
