Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, calculates the side length of the square, and prints the area of the square. The program assumes that the input is valid, as stated in the problem description, and it handles the input correctly.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the square's corners. It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. This is correct because the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, so the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates represents the length of one side of the square.

Finally, the program prints the square of the side length, which is the area of the square.

Correctness: **True**
