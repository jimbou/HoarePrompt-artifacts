Output State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is either the smallest integer k such that (1 << k) - (1 << i) > number or 0, `overlap` is either the value of i such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number or 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i)**

In this output state, the values of `number`, `sequence`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `size` is either the smallest integer k such that (1 << k) - (1 << i) > number or 0, depending on the initial value of `size_overlap`. The value of `overlap` is either the value of i such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number or 0, also depending on the initial value of `size_overlap`. The value of `value` is still (1 << size) - (1 << i), but now `size` and `i` have been updated according to the initial value of `size_overlap`.
