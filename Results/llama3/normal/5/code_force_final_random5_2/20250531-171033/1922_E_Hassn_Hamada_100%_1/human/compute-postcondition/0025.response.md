Output State: **number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least one element, size_overlap is a tuple of two values (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), i is the second largest value in the sequence list, size is the smallest integer such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) is greater than number, value is (1 << size) - (1 << i)**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `number`, `sequence`, `size_overlap`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the values of `size` and `value` have been updated. The value of `size` is now the smallest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is greater than `number`, and the value of `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.
