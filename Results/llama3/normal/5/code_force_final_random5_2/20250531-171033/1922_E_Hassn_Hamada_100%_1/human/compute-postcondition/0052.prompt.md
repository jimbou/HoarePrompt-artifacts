You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer and sequence is a list of integers.
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values: the first value is 0, which is the current value of the number, and the second value is also 0, which is also the current value of the number.
    #State: The number is a positive integer and sequence is a list of integers. The number is not equal to 0.
    size_overlap = 0, 0
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
        
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = size, i
            break
        
    #State: number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least one element, size_overlap is a tuple of two values (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), i is the smallest value in the sequence list, size is the smallest integer k such that (1 << k) - (1 << i) > number, value is (1 << size) - (1 << i)
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least `size - overlap + 1` elements, `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list plus `size - overlap`, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i + size - overlap)), and the last `size - overlap` elements of `sequence` are `i + overlap`, `i + overlap + 1`, ..., `i + size - 1`.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns two values: the first value is 0, which is the current value of the number, and the second value is also 0, which is also the current value of the number.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
