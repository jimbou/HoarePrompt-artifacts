The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second largest value in the sequence list. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be one less than the second largest value in the sequence list.
State: **number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least one element, size_overlap is a tuple of two values (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), i is the third largest value in the sequence list, size is the smallest integer such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) is greater than number, value is (1 << size) - (1 << i). If value is less than or equal to number, then the current value of value is less than or equal to number. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
