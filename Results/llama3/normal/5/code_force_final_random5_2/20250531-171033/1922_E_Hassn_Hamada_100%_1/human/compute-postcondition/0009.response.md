According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `size`, `i`, and `number`. If `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is `i + 2`, `i` is the maximum value in the `sequence` list, and `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `number` to be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`, because `size` is `i + 2` and we need `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` to be less than or equal to `number`.

State: **`number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `size_overlap` is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value in the `sequence` list, `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)**
