To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `size`, and `overlap`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop will execute if `size - overlap` is greater than 0.
2. Since `size` is either the smallest integer k such that (1 << k) - (1 << i) > number or 0, we know that `size` is at least 1.
3. Since `overlap` is either the value of i such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number or 0, we know that `overlap` is at most `size`.
4. To ensure the loop executes, we need `size - overlap` to be at least 1. This means `overlap` must be less than `size`.
5. Since `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list, we can set `i` to be the smallest value in the list.

State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i)**
