Output State: `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least `size - overlap + 1` elements, `i` is the next smallest value in the `sequence` list plus `size - overlap - 1`, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i+size-overlap-1)), and the last `size - overlap` elements of `sequence` are `(i + size - overlap - 1) + overlap`, `(i + size - overlap - 2) + overlap`, ..., `i + overlap`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `sequence` list will have at least `size - overlap + 1` elements, with the last `size - overlap` elements being consecutive integers starting from `i + overlap` and ending at `(i + size - overlap - 1) + overlap`. The value of `i` will be the next smallest value in the `sequence` list plus `size - overlap - 1`, and the value of `value` will be calculated based on the updated `i` and `size`. The other variables, `number` and `overlap`, remain unchanged.
