Output State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is the next smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and the last element of `sequence` is `i + overlap`.**

In this output state, the value of `sequence` has been updated by appending the value of `i + overlap` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The size of the `sequence` list has increased by 1, and it now has at least three elements. The last element of the `sequence` list is the sum of `i` and `overlap`.
