According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `size`, `i`, and `number`. If `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1) + 2) - (1 << (i + 1))`, `size` is `i + 3`, and `i` is the second largest value in the sequence list.

For the loop to execute again, `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` must be less than or equal to `number`. Since `size` is `i + 3`, we can substitute this into the inequality to get `(1 << (i + 3) + 1) - (1 << i)`.

Since `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1) + 2) - (1 << (i + 1))`, we can see that `number` is already greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`. However, we need to ensure that `number` is also greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3) + 1) - (1 << i)`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `number` to be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3) + 1) - (1 << i)`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, and `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3) + 1) - (1 << i)`, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `size_overlap` is a tuple of two values (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), `i` is the second largest value in the sequence list, `size` is i + 3, `value` is (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)**
