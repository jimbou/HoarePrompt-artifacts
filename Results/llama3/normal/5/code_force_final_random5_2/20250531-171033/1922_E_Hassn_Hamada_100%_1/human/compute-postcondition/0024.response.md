Output State: **number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, and number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + 3) + 1) - (1 << i), sequence is a list of integers that must have at least one element, size_overlap is a tuple of two values (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), i is the second largest value in the sequence list, size is i + 4, value is (1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)**
