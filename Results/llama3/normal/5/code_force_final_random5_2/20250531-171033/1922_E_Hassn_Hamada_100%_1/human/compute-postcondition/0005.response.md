To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the `max(sequence, default=0)` expression.

1.  For the loop to execute, `i` must have an initial value. Since `i` is defined by the `range` function, its initial value will be the maximum value in the `sequence` list (or 0 if the list is empty, thanks to the `default=0` argument).

2.  The `sequence` list must have at least one element for `max(sequence, default=0)` to return a value greater than 0. If the list is empty, `max` will return 0, and the loop will not execute.

3.  The `size_overlap` tuple and `number` variable are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Considering these points, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `size_overlap` is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value in the `sequence` list**
