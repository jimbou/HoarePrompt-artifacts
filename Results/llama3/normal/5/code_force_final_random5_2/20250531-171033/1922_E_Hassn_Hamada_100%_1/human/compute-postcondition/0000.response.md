Output State: **The number is a positive integer and sequence is a list of integers. No changes have been made to the variables as the given code snippet is just a docstring and does not contain any executable code.**

In this case, the code snippet is just a docstring that provides documentation for a function, but it does not contain any executable code. Therefore, the values of the variables 'number' and 'sequence' remain unchanged. The output state is the same as the initial state, with 'number' being a positive integer and 'sequence' being a list of integers.
