According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `size`, `i`, and `number`. If `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is increased by 2, `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`, and `i` and `number` must be such that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`. For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be increased by 2 again, and `i` and `number` must be such that `(1 << (size + 2) + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`size` is increased by 4, `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`, and `i` and `number` must be such that `(1 << (size + 2) + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`**
