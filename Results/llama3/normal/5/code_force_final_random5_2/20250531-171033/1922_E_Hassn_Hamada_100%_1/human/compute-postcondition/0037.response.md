Output State: **size is increased by the maximum possible value, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and i and number are such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the size variable is increased by the maximum possible value, the value variable is updated accordingly, and the values of i and number are such that the loop condition remains true.
