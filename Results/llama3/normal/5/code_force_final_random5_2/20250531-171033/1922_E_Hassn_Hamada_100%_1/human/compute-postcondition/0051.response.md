Output State: **`number` is decreased by (1 << size) - (1 << overlap), `sequence` is updated by the function `func_1`, `i` is still the smallest value in the `sequence` list plus `size - overlap`, `size` is still at least 1, `overlap` is still less than `size`, `value` is still (1 << size) - (1 << (i + size - overlap)), and the last `size - overlap` elements of `sequence` are `i + overlap`, `i + overlap + 1`, ..., `i + size - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `number` is reduced by the difference between 2 to the power of `size` and 2 to the power of `overlap`. The `sequence` list is modified by the function `func_1`, but the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the smallest value in the `sequence` list plus the difference between `size` and `overlap`. The `size` and `overlap` variables retain their original values, and the `value` variable is still calculated based on `size` and `i`. The last `size - overlap` elements of the `sequence` list are still a sequence of consecutive integers starting from `i + overlap`.
