To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `size` and `overlap`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `size` and `overlap`. If `i` is less than `size - overlap`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, and the last element of `sequence` is `i + overlap`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, and `size` and `overlap` must remain the same.

State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is the next smallest value in the `sequence` list plus one, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, and `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i+1)), and the last element of `sequence` is (i + 1) + overlap**
