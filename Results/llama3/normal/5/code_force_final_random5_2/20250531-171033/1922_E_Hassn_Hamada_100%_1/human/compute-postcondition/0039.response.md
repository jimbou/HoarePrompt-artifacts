Output State: **size_overlap is equal to the original value of size, i is equal to its original value, size is increased by the maximum possible value, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and i and number are such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number. The current value of value is less than or equal to number.**

In this output state, the variable size_overlap is assigned the original value of size and i. The value of size is increased by the maximum possible value. The value of value is calculated as (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and it is less than or equal to number. The relationship between i and number remains the same, with (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) being less than or equal to number.
