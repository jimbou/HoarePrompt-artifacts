Output State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least `size - overlap + 1` elements, `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list plus `size - overlap`, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i + size - overlap)), and the last `size - overlap` elements of `sequence` are `i + overlap`, `i + overlap + 1`, ..., `i + size - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The `number` remains a positive integer not equal to 0.
* The `sequence` list has at least `size - overlap + 1` elements.
* The value of `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list plus `size - overlap`.
* The `size` is at least 1.
* The `overlap` is less than `size`.
* The `value` is calculated as (1 << size) - (1 << (i + size - overlap)).
* The last `size - overlap` elements of the `sequence` list are `i + overlap`, `i + overlap + 1`, ..., `i + size - 1`.
