Output State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and `sequence` now includes an additional element which is `i + overlap`**
