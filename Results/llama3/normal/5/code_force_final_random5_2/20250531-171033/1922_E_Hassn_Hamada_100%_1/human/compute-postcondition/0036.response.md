Output State: **size is increased by 5, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and i and number must be such that (1 << (size + 2) + 1) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1 from its initial state, resulting in an increase of 5. The value of `value` has been updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which is a new calculation based on the updated `size` and the existing value of `i`. The relationship between `i`, `number`, and the expression `(1 << (size + 2) + 1) - (1 << i)` remains valid, ensuring that the expression is less than or equal to `number`.
