Output State: **number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least one element, size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), i is the maximum value in the sequence list, size is i + 2, value is (1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)**

The code snippet modifies the values of `size` and `value`. The first line increments `size` by 1, making it `i + 2`. The second line updates `value` to be `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`, which is a new calculation based on the updated value of `size`. The other variables, `number`, `sequence`, `size_overlap`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
