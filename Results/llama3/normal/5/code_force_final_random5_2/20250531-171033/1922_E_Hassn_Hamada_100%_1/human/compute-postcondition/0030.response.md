Output State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `size_overlap` is a tuple of two values (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), `i` is the third largest value in the sequence list, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i).**

In this output state, the values of `number`, `sequence`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the third largest value in the sequence list. However, the value of `size` is now `i + 1`, and the value of `value` is calculated as (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i), which is equivalent to 2^i.
