Output State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least four elements, `i` is the next smallest value in the `sequence` list plus one, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i+1)), and the last two elements of `sequence` are (i + 1) + overlap and i + overlap.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number remains a positive integer not equal to 0. The sequence list now has at least four elements, with the last two elements being (i + 1) + overlap and i + overlap. The values of i, size, overlap, and value remain unchanged.
