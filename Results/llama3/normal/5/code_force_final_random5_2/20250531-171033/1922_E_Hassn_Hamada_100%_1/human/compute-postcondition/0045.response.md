To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`, and `overlap`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop condition is `i in range(size - overlap)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size - overlap`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes the next smallest value in the `sequence` list.
4. The value of `size` and `overlap` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop body.


State: **`number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the next smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i)**
