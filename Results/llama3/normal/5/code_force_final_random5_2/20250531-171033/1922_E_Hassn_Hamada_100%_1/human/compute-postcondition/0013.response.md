Output State: **number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least one element, size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), i is the maximum value in the sequence list, size is the smallest integer k such that (1 << k) - (1 << i) > number, value is (1 << size) - (1 << i)**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing when the value of `size` is the smallest integer `k` such that `(1 << k) - (1 << i)` is greater than `number`. At this point, the value of `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which is greater than `number`. The other variables, `sequence`, `size_overlap`, and `i`, remain unchanged throughout the loop.
