State: **number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least one element, size_overlap is a tuple of two values (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0), i is the second largest value in the sequence list, size is the smallest integer k such that (1 << k) - (1 << i) > number, value is (1 << size) - (1 << i)**
