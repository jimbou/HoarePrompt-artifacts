Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is either the smallest integer k such that (1 << k) - (1 << i) > number or 0, `overlap` is either the value of i such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number or 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(size - overlap):
    sequence.append(i + overlap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and `sequence` now includes an additional element which is `i + overlap`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is the next smallest value in the `sequence` list, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and the last element of `sequence` is `i + overlap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least four elements, `i` is the next smallest value in the `sequence` list plus one, `size` is at least 1, `overlap` is less than `size`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i+1)), and the last two elements of `sequence` are (i + 1) + overlap and i + overlap.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
