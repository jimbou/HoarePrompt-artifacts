Output State: **size is increased by 1, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `size` by 1. The second line assigns a new value to `value` based on the updated `size` and the existing value of `i`. The expression `(1 << size)` calculates 2 to the power of `size`, and `(1 << i)` calculates 2 to the power of `i`. The difference between these two values is assigned to `value`. 

Note that the initial values of `size` and `i` are not provided, so the exact values of `size` and `value` after the code execution cannot be determined. However, the output state describes the relationship between the variables after the code execution.
