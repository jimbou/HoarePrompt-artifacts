The code `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1. Since `x` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1, the value of `cnt[x]` will be incremented to 2.

Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the second integer in the list as a key and its value is 2, `x` is the second integer in the list.**
