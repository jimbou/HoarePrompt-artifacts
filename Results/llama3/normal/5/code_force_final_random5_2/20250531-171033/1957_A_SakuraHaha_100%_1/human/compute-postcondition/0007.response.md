Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an empty list, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary with keys as integers from the list and their values as the frequency of each integer, x is the last integer in the list**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same stdin, n, and ans as the initial state. The list 'a' will be empty because the loop iterates over all elements in the list. The dictionary 'cnt' will contain all unique integers from the list as keys and their respective frequencies as values. The variable 'x' will hold the last integer from the list.
