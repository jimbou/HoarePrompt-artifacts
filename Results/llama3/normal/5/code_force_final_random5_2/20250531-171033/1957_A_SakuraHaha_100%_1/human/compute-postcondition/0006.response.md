The value of `cnt[x]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `x` is the third integer in the list `a` and `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 2, `cnt[x]` is now 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the third integer in the list as a key and its value is 3, `x` is the third integer in the list.**
