Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 1 and 100. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to `a`. The third line initializes `ans` to 0. The fourth line initializes `cnt` as an empty dictionary. The remaining test cases, `t-1`, are still in stdin.
