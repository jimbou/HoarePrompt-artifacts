Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by `cnt.values()[1] // 3` and `x // 3`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `x` is the third value in `cnt`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `x // 3` to its previous value, where `x` is the third value in the dictionary `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is still an empty list, and `cnt` is still a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs.
