The code prints the value of `ans`, which is increased by the sum of all values in `cnt` divided by 3. Since `cnt` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs, the sum of all values in `cnt` is the sum of all values in the dictionary. The value of `ans` is increased by this sum divided by 3.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of all values in cnt divided by 3)**
