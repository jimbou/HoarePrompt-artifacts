Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by `x // 3`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `x` is the first value in `cnt`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the integer division of `x` by 3 to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains t-1 test cases, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is still an empty list, and `cnt` is still a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. The value of `x` is still the first value in `cnt`.
