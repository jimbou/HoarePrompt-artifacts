Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than 1, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the first element, and list must have at least 4 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 4, i is 2, the third element of list is less than its original value by twice the value of the second element, the second element of list is less than its original value by the value of the second element.**

In this output state, the value of the fourth element of list is reduced by the value of the first element, the value of the third element of list is reduced by twice the value of the second element, and the value of the second element of list is reduced by the value of the second element. All other variables remain unchanged.
