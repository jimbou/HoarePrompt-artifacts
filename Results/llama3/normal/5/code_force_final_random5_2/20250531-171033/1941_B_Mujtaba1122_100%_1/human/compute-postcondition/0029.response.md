Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is 0, and the rest of the elements are greater than 0 and less than their original values by the sum of all the previous elements, and list must have at least n elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 3, i is n - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list where the first three elements are 0, and the rest of the elements are greater than 0 but less than their original values. The amount by which each element is reduced is the sum of all the previous elements. The list must have at least n elements, where n is the length of the list and n is greater than or equal to 3. The loop variable i is equal to n - 1.
