Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is the length of `list` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 1
Code of the loop:
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
    list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
    list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is reduced by 3 times the original first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is reduced by the original first element, and list must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is reduced by 4 times the original first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is reduced by 3 times the original first element, and list must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is reduced by 4 times the original first element and then reduced by 1 times the original first element and then reduced by 2 times the original first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is reduced by 3 times the original first element and then reduced by 1 times the original first element, and list must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1, and list[1] is greater than 1, list[0] is greater than 0, and list[2] is greater than 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
