Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than 1, the fourth element is greater than 0, and list must have at least 4 elements, the third element is decreased by 1 times the second element, the second element is decreased by 2 times the first element, the first element is decreased by 1 times the first element, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 4, i is 2**

In this output state, the initial conditions for the list and n are still valid, but the values of the list elements have been modified according to the code. The third element is decreased by 1 times the second element, the second element is decreased by 2 times the first element, and the first element is decreased by 1 times the first element. The value of i remains unchanged at 2.
