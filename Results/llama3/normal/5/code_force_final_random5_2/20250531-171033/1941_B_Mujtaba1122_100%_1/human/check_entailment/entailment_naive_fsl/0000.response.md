Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 7, 2], the program will print 'NO' because it cannot make all elements zero using the described operations. However, the correct output should be 'NO' because it is not possible to make all elements zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the elements can be made zero by repeatedly subtracting 1 from the first element, 2 from the second element, and 1 from the third element. However, this approach does not consider all possible operations that can be performed.

A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the elements at even indices is equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices. If they are equal, then it is possible to make all elements zero using the described operations. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is a correct solution:

```
def func_2(list, n):
    even_sum = sum(list[::2])
    odd_sum = sum(list[1::2])
    if even_sum == odd_sum:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This solution works by summing up the elements at even indices and the elements at odd indices separately. If the two sums are equal, then it is possible to make all elements zero using the described operations. Otherwise, it is not possible.
