This function modifies the input list of integers by iteratively subtracting values from the elements, starting from the third element, based on the values of the previous elements. It then checks the modified list using the function func_1 and prints 'YES' if the check passes, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function also returns without printing anything if the list cannot be modified according to the specified rules.
