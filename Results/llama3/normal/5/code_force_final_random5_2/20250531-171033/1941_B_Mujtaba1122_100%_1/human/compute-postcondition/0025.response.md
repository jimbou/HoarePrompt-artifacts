Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and the value of the second element, the third element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 1 and less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element, the fifth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the fourth element, and list must have at least 5 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 5, i is 3**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list remains a list of integers with at least 5 elements. The first element is still 0. The second element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and the value of the second element. The third element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element. The fourth element is greater than 1 and less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element. The fifth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the fourth element. The length of the list, represented by the integer n, is still greater than or equal to 5. The value of i remains 3.
