Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and the value of the second element and 1, the third element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element and 3, the fourth element is greater than 1 and less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element and 1, the fifth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the fourth element, and list must have at least 5 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 5, i is 3**

In this output state, the changes made to the list are as follows:

* The second element is decreased by twice its original value and the value of the second element and 1.
* The third element is decreased by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element and 3.
* The fourth element is decreased by the value of the first element and the value of the third element and 1.
* The fifth element is decreased by the value of the fourth element.

The value of i remains unchanged at 3. The length of the list, represented by n, also remains unchanged, and it is still greater than or equal to 5.
