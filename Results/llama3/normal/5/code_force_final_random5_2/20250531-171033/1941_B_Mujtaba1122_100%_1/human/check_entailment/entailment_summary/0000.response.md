Correctness: **False**

Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation allows Rudolf to choose an index `i` and assign `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, and `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`. However, in the function `func_2`, the operation is implemented as `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, which is not equivalent to the original operation.

Additionally, the function `func_2` does not correctly check if the list can be modified according to the specified rules. It only checks if the list can be modified by repeatedly applying the operation to the elements starting from the third element, but it does not consider other possible sequences of operations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description.
