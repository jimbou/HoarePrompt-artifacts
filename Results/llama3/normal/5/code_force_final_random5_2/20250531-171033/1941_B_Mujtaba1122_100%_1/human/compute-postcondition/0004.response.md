Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is reduced by 4 times the original first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is reduced by 3 times the original first element, and list must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list has been modified such that the first element is now 0, the second element has been reduced by 4 times the original first element, and the third element has been reduced by 3 times the original first element. The length of the list, represented by the variable n, remains the same and is still greater than or equal to 3. The variable i remains unchanged at 1.
