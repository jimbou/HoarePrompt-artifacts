Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the previous element, 2 from the current element, and 1 from the next element.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` checks if all elements of the array are zero, and `func_2` applies the operation to the array.

In `func_2`, the program iterates over the array from the second element to the second last element. For each element, it checks if the current element is greater than 1 and the previous and next elements are greater than 0. If this condition is true, it applies the operation to the current element and its neighbors.

After applying the operation to all elements, the program calls `func_1` to check if all elements of the array are zero. If `func_1` returns True, the program prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero. If `func_1` returns False, the program prints "NO".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
