Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than the second element plus 1 minus the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 minus the second element, and list must have at least 4 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 4, i is 2**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list remains a list of integers with at least 4 elements. The first element is still 0. The second element is still greater than 0. The third element is now greater than the second element plus 1 minus the first element (which is 0), so it's still greater than the second element plus 1. The fourth element is now greater than 0 minus the second element, which means it's still greater than 0. The value of n remains the same, which is the length of the list and is greater than or equal to 4. The value of i remains 2.
