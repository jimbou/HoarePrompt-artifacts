Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is reduced by 3 times the original first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is reduced by the original first element, and list must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1**

In this output state, the first element of the list becomes 0 because it is reduced by its original value. The second element is reduced by three times the original first element, and the third element is reduced by the original first element. The value of n and i remains unchanged.
