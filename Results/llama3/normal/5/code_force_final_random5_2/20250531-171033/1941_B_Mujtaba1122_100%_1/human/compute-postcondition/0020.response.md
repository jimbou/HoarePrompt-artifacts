Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the first element, and list must have at least 4 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 4, i is 2, the third element of list is less than its original value by twice the value of the second element, the second element of list is less than its original value by the value of the second element.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the first element, and the list must have at least 4 elements. The length of the list is represented by the integer n, which is greater than or equal to 4. The index i is 2. The third element of the list is less than its original value by twice the value of the second element, and the second element of the list is less than its original value by the value of the second element.
