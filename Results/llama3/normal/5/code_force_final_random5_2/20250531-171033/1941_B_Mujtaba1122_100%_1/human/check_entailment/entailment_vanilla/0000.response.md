Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 checks if all elements in the list are equal to zero, and returns True if they are, and False otherwise. func_2 is the main function that attempts to make all elements of the list equal to zero using the specified operation.

func_2 iterates over the list from the second element to the second last element. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than 1 and if the previous and next elements are greater than 0. If these conditions are met, it subtracts 1 from the next element, subtracts 2 from the current element, and subtracts 1 from the previous element, effectively applying the operation.

After applying the operation, func_2 checks if the previous element is equal to 0. If it is not, it prints 'no' and returns, indicating that it is not possible to make all elements of the list equal to zero.

If func_2 completes the iteration over the list without returning, it calls func_1 to check if all elements in the list are equal to zero. If they are, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The operation is not correctly implemented. The line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` should be `list[i + 1] -= 1`, and the line `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` should be `list[i] -= 2`.

2. The condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` is not correct. It should be `while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0`.

3. The function func_2 does not handle the case where the first or last element of the list is not equal to zero.

4. The function func_2 prints 'no' and returns when it encounters an element that cannot be made equal to zero, but it does not print 'YES' when it successfully makes all elements equal to zero.

5. The function func_2 modifies the input list, which is not necessary and can be avoided.

6. The function func_2 does not check if the input list is empty or if the length of the list is less than 3, which can cause an IndexError.

7. The function func_2 does not handle the case where the input list contains non-integer values.

8. The function func_2 does not handle the case where the input list contains negative numbers.

Correctness: **False**
