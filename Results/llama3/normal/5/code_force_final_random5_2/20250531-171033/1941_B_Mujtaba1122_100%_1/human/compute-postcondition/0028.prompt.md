Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the first element, and list must have at least 4 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 4, i is 3, the third element of list is less than its original value by twice the value of the second element, the second element of list is less than its original value by the value of the second element.
Code of the loop:
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
    list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
    list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and the value of the second element, the third element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 1 and less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element, and list must have at least 4 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 4, i is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and the value of the second element, the third element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 1 and less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element, the fifth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the fourth element, and list must have at least 5 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 5, i is 3
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and the value of the second element and 1, the third element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element and 3, the fourth element is greater than 1 and less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element and 1, the fifth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the fourth element, and list must have at least 5 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 5, i is 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
