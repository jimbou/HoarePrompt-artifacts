To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the length of the list, which is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The state of the list and its elements is not modified by the loop head, so we don't need to adjust those states.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 0 and is reduced by the original first element times the number of iterations, and list must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 3, i is 2, and the element at index i-1 in list is 0**
