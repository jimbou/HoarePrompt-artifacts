To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). 

Since `n` is already stated to be the length of `list` and `n >= 3`, we can conclude that `list` must have at least 3 elements. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be 1, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an integer such that `n` is the length of `list` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 1**
