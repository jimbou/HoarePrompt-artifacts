Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and the value of the second element, the third element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 1 and less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element, and list must have at least 4 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 4, i is 3.**

In this output state, the first element of the list remains 0. The second element is less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and the value of the second element. The third element is less than its original value by twice the value of the second element and twice the value of the first element. The fourth element is less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element. The length of the list and the value of n remain unchanged. The value of i remains 3.
