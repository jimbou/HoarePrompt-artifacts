Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the value of the first element and the value of the third element, and list must have at least 4 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 4, i is 3.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers where the first three elements are 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value by the sum of the first and third elements, and the list has at least 4 elements. The value of n remains the same as the length of the list, which is at least 4. The value of i remains 3.
