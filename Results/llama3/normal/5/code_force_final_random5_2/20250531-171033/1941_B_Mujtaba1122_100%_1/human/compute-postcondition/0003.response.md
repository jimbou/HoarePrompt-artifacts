According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `list[i]` is greater than 1 and is reduced by 3 times the original first element, `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0 and is reduced by the original first element, and `list[i + 1]` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, and `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0.

Since `i` is 1, `list[i]` is the second element of the list, `list[i - 1]` is the first element of the list, and `list[i + 1]` is the third element of the list.

The first element of the list is 0, so `list[i - 1]` is 0. This does not meet the condition that `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0.

The second element of the list is greater than 1 and is reduced by 3 times the original first element. Since the first element is 0, the second element is still greater than 1.

The third element of the list is greater than 0 and is reduced by the original first element. Since the first element is 0, the third element is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

* `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0
* `list[i]` must be greater than 1
* `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0

State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is reduced by 3 times the original first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is reduced by the original first element, and list must have at least 3 elements, n is an integer such that n is the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1**
