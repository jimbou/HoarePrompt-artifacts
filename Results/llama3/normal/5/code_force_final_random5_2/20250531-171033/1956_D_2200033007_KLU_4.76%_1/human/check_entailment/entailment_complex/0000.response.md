Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases: when the length of the input list `c` is 2, and when it's not. However, the problem statement requires the program to handle arrays of integers of length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 18`, and each integer in the array is between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive).

The program does not provide a general solution to the problem. It only provides hardcoded solutions for two specific cases, and it does not attempt to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` as required by the problem statement.

Furthermore, the program does not use the input array `a` at all. It only uses the length of the array `c` (which is not even defined in the program) to determine what to print.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
