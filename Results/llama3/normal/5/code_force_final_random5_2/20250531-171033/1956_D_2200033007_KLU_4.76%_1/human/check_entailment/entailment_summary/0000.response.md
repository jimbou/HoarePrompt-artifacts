Reasoning:
The given program is not correct. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array is 2, it prints '4 1' and '1 2', and when the length of the array is not 2, it prints '13 0'. However, the problem statement requires the program to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing a specific operation, and the program does not implement this logic. The program also does not use the input array `a` at all, which is required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
