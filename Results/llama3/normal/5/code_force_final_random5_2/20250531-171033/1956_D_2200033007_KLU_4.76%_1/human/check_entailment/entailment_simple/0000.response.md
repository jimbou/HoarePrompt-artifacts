Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. It only handles the cases where `n` is 2 or not 2, and prints hardcoded values. It does not consider the actual values in the array `a` or the optimal solution to the problem.

The function does not calculate the maximum sum of the elements of the array `a` or construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. It simply prints hardcoded values, which are not necessarily correct for all inputs.

Additionally, the function does not use the input values in the array `a` at all. It only uses the length of the array `n` to determine which hardcoded values to print.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
