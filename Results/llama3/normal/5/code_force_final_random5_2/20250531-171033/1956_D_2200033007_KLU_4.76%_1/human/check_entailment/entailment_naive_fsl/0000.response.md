Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the array is 2 or 3, and it does not provide a general solution for arrays of any length. For example, if the input is an array of length 4, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the program will not produce the correct output.

The program also does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the elements of the array. It simply prints a fixed output for the cases it handles, without actually performing the necessary operations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to iterate over all possible subarrays of the input array, compute the MEX of each subarray, and update the array accordingly. It would also need to keep track of the maximum sum achieved and the sequence of operations that achieved it.

In summary, the program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for arrays of any length and does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the elements of the array.
