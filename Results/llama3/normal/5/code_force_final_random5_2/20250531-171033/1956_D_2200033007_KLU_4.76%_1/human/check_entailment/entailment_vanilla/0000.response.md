Reasoning:

The given program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input and stores it in the list `a`, but it does not use this input to calculate the maximum sum or generate the sequence of operations.

2. The function `func_1` is called with the length of the input list `a`, but it only handles two specific cases: when the length is 2 and when the length is not 2 (in which case it prints a fixed output for a length of 3). It does not handle any other cases.

3. The function `func_1` does not calculate the maximum sum or generate the sequence of operations. It simply prints a fixed output for the two handled cases.

4. The program does not use the input values in the list `a` to calculate the maximum sum or generate the sequence of operations.

5. The program does not follow the problem's requirements, which is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` and generate a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

Correctness: **False**
