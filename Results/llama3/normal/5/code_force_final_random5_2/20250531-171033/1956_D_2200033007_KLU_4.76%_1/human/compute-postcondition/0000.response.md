Output State: **`c` is a list of integers of length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 18, and each integer in `c` is between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive), `m` is 0**

In this output state, the list `c` remains unchanged with the same length `n` and integer values between 0 and 10^7. A new variable `m` is introduced and assigned the value 0.
