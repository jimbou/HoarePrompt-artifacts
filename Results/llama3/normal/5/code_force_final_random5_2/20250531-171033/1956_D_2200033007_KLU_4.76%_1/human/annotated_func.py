#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of integers of length n, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and each integer in c is between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive).
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: *`c` is a list of integers of length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 18, and each integer in `c` is between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive), `m` is 0. If `c` is equal to 2, '1 2' is printed. Otherwise, '13 0' is printed.
    return
    #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of 'm' is still 0. The list 'c' remains unchanged with 'n' integers between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers `c` as input and prints specific values based on the value of `c`. If `c` is equal to 2, it prints '4 1' and '1 2'. If `c` is not equal to 2, it prints '13 0'. The function does not modify the input list `c` and does not return any value.
