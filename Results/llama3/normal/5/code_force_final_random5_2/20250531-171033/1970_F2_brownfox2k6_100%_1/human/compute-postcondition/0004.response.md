Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary with at least 1 key, `blud` is a list of two integers, `p` is the first key in the dictionary. If the value of `player[p]` is equal to `blud`, then `out` is a list containing the first key of the dictionary and the value of `player[p]` is [-1, -1]. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
