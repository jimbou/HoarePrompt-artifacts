Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes the game state by reading the field dimensions, player positions, goal positions, and Bludger position.
2. The `func_1` function correctly updates the coordinates of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the given direction.
3. The `func_2` function correctly identifies and eliminates players whose positions match the Bludger's position, updating their positions and printing elimination messages.
4. The main game loop correctly iterates through the actions, updating the game state accordingly. It checks for scoring events, updates the score, and prints the final score at the end of the game.
5. The program correctly handles the Quaffle's movement and scoring events, including the case where a player scores in their own goal.
6. The program correctly handles player elimination events, printing the elimination messages in alphabetical order.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game logic and produces the expected output based on the problem description and execution summaries.
