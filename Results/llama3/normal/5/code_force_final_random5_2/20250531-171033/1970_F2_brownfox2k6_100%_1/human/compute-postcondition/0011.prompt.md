Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a player and each value is a list of two integers representing the position of the player on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary with at least 1 key, `blud` is a list of two integers, `p` is the first key in the dictionary. If the value of `player[p]` is equal to `blud`, then `out` is a list containing the first key of the dictionary and the value of `player[p]` is [-1, -1]. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `blud` is a list of two integers, `p` is the second key in the dictionary. If the value of `player[p]` is equal to `blud`, then `out` is a list containing the second key in the dictionary and `player[p]` is a list containing two -1 values. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, blud is a list of two integers, p is the third key in the dictionary. If the value of player[p] is equal to blud, then out is a list with p appended to it and player[p] is a list containing two -1 values. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
