Moves an entity on a field by updating its coordinates based on a given direction. The function takes a list of two integers representing the entity's current coordinates and a string representing the direction of movement (U, D, L, or R). It then updates the coordinates accordingly: moving up decreases the x-coordinate, moving down increases the x-coordinate, moving left decreases the y-coordinate, and moving right increases the y-coordinate. The function returns the updated coordinates.
