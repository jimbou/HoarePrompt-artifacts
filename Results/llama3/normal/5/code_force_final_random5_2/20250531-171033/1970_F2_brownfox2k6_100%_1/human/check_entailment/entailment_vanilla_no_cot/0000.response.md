Correctness: **False** 

The provided program is incomplete and does not fully address the problem description. It lacks the main logic to simulate the game, handle the Quaffle and goals, and print the final score. The functions provided only seem to handle player movement and elimination by the Bludger, but do not account for the Quaffle's movement, catching, and throwing, as well as scoring and printing the final score.
