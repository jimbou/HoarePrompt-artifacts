Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `blud` is a list of two integers, `p` is the second key in the dictionary. If the value of `player[p]` is equal to `blud`, then `out` is a list containing the second key in the dictionary and `player[p]` is a list containing two -1 values. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
