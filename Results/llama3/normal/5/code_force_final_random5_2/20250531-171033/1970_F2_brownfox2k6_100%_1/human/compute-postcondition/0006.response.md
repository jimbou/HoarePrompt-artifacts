Output State: **t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, blud is a list of two integers, p is the second key in the dictionary, out is a list containing the second key in the dictionary, player[p] is a list containing two -1 values**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer. The `player` dictionary still has at least 2 keys, but the value associated with the key `p` has been updated to `[-1, -1]`. The `blud` list remains unchanged as a list of two integers. The value of `p` is still the second key in the dictionary. Additionally, the `out` list now contains the second key in the dictionary, which is `p`.
