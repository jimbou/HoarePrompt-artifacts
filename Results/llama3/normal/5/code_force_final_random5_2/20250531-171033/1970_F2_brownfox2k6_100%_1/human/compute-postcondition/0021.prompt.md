Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a player and each value is a list of two integers representing the position of the player on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing all players whose positions were equal to the Bludger's position. The positions of these players in the `player` dictionary are updated to [-1, -1].
Code of the loop:
for p in sorted(out):
    print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a player and each value is a list of two integers representing the position of the player on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is a list containing at least 1 player whose positions were equal to the Bludger's position, `p` is the first player in the sorted list `out`, and this is printed: the time `t`, the first eliminated player `p` and the string 'ELIMINATED'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a player and each value is a list of two integers representing the position of the player on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is a list containing at least 1 player whose positions were equal to the Bludger's position, `p` is the second player in the sorted list `out`, and this is printed: the time `t`, the second player `p` in the sorted list `out`, and the string 'ELIMINATED'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a player and each value is a list of two integers representing the position of the player on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is a list containing at least 2 players whose positions were equal to the Bludger's position, `p` is the third player in the sorted list `out`, and this is printed: the time `t`, the third player `p` in the sorted list `out` and the string 'ELIMINATED'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
