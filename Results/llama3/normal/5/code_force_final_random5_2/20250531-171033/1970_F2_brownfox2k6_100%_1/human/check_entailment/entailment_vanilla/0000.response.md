Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be a simulation of a Quidditch game, where two teams, Gryffindor (R) and Ravenclaw (B), compete to score points by throwing the Quaffle into the opponent's goal. The game also features a Bludger that can eliminate players.

Function 1, `func_1`, seems to update the position of an object (player or ball) based on the direction `d` provided. The function correctly updates the x and y coordinates of the object based on the direction.

Function 2, `func_2`, appears to handle the elimination of players by the Bludger. It checks if any player is at the same position as the Bludger and, if so, adds the player to the `out` list. It then updates the player's position to [-1, -1] to indicate elimination. Finally, it prints the elimination event for each player in the `out` list, sorted alphabetically.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The `player` and `blud` variables are not defined anywhere in the provided code. It is assumed that these variables are defined elsewhere in the program, but without their definitions, the code will not work as intended.
2. The `func_2` function only checks for player elimination by the Bludger, but it does not handle the case where a player scores a goal. The program should also check for goal scoring events and update the score accordingly.
3. The program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle and it lands in the opponent's goal. This event should also be handled and the score updated accordingly.

Considering these issues, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
