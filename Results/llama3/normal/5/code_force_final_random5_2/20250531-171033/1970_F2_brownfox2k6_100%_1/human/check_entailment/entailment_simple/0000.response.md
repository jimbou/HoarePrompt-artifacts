Reasoning:

The given program appears to be a correct implementation of the Quidditch game simulation. It correctly handles the movement of players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger, as well as the scoring and elimination of players.

The program uses a dictionary to store the positions of players, which allows for efficient lookup and updating of player positions. The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction of movement, and the `func_2` function correctly handles the elimination of players who come into contact with the Bludger.

The program also correctly handles the scoring of goals, including the case where a player scores in their own goal, which results in the opposing team scoring a point.

The output of the program matches the expected output for the given examples, which suggests that the program is working correctly.

However, there are a few potential issues with the program. For example, the program assumes that the input is valid and does not include any error checking. Additionally, the program uses a simple dictionary to store the positions of players, which may not be efficient for large numbers of players.

Overall, based on the provided code and examples, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
