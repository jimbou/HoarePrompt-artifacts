            #State: *`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction of movement. If `d` is 'L', the y-coordinate of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the y-coordinate of `obj` is incremented by 1.
        #State: *`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'D', the x-coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is 'L', the y-coordinate of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the y-coordinate of `obj` is incremented by 1.
    #State: *obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If d is 'U', the first coordinate of obj is decreased by 1. If d is 'D', the first coordinate of obj is increased by 1. If d is 'L', the second coordinate of obj is decreased by 1. If d is 'R', the second coordinate of obj is increased by 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:Moves an entity on a field by updating its coordinates based on a given direction. The function takes a list of two integers representing the entity's current coordinates and a string representing the direction of movement (U, D, L, or R). It then updates the coordinates accordingly: moving up decreases the x-coordinate, moving down increases the x-coordinate, moving left decreases the y-coordinate, and moving right increases the y-coordinate. The function returns the updated coordinates.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a player and each value is a list of two integers representing the position of the player on the field, and blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field.
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a player and each value is a list of two integers representing the position of the player on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing all players whose positions were equal to the Bludger's position. The positions of these players in the `player` dictionary are updated to [-1, -1].
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a player and each value is a list of two integers representing the position of the player on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is an empty list, and for each player `p` in the sorted list of players who were eliminated, the time `t`, the player `p`, and the string 'ELIMINATED' are printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Identifies and eliminates players whose positions match the Bludger's position, updating their positions and printing elimination messages.
