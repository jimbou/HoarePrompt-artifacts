The code `frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1` updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the first integer `num` in the list `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `arr` and the value is 1, `num` is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the `frequency_table` dictionary now contains an entry for the first integer `num` in the list `arr`, with a count of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
