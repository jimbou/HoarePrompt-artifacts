Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `arr` and the value is `k`, `num` is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated to `k`, which is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains at least one integer, and all elements in `arr` are still between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The value of `num` is still the first integer in the list `arr`.
