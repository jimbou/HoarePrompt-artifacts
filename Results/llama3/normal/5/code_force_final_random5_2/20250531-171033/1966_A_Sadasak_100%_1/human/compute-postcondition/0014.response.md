Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `frequency_table` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the `arr` list as keys, and their corresponding values will be the frequency of each integer in `arr`, but capped at the value of `k`. This means that if an integer appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its frequency in `frequency_table` will be set to `k`, rather than its actual frequency. The `arr` list and the `k` integer remain unchanged.
