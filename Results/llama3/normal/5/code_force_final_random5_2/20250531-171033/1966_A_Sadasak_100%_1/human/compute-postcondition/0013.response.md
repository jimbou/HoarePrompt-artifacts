Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in `arr`, 1 <= x <= 100, `num` is the next integer in `arr`. If the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is greater than `k`, then the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the state of `frequency_table` remains unchanged.***
