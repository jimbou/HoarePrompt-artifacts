The code `frequency_table[num] = k` assigns the value of `k` to the key `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary. The value of `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the value of `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`. The previous value of `frequency_table[num]` was the count of the next integer in `arr` incremented by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in `arr`, 1 <= x <= 100, `num` is the next integer in `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the next integer in `arr` and the value is `k`.**
