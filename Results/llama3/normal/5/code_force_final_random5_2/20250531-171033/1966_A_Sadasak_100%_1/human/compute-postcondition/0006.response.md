State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100. If the frequency of the first integer in `arr` is greater than `k`, then the frequency_table is updated to have the first integer in `arr` as key and `k` as value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the frequency_table, num is the second integer in `arr`.**
