Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code creates a new empty dictionary called `frequency_table`. The constraints on the values of `arr` and `k` are still valid, as the code does not affect them.
