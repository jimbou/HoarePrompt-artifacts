The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, arr is a list of integers, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100, frequency_table is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, num is the first integer in the list**
