This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, where the frequency of each integer is capped at a specified maximum value. It takes a list of integers and an integer as input, and returns a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer, limited to the specified maximum value. The function ensures that the frequency of each integer does not exceed the specified maximum value, which is between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and that all integers in the input list are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
