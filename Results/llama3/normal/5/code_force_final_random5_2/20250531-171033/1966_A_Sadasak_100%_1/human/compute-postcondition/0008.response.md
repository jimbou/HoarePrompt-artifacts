Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100, `frequency_table` has the first integer in `arr` as key and `k` as value, and the second integer in `arr` as key and its frequency increased by 1.**

In this output state, the frequency_table has been updated to have the first integer in `arr` as key and `k` as value, regardless of its original frequency. Additionally, the frequency of the second integer in `arr` has been increased by 1 in the frequency_table. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged.
