The code updates the frequency_table dictionary with the next integer in `arr`. The frequency_table is updated with the count of the next integer in `arr`. The value of the next integer in `arr` is incremented by 1 in the frequency_table. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in `arr`, 1 <= x <= 100, `num` is the next integer in `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the key is the next integer in `arr` and the value is the count of the next integer in `arr` incremented by 1.**
