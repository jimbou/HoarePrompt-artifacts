Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, for all elements x in arr, 1 <= x <= 100. If the frequency of the first integer in `arr` is greater than `k`, then the frequency_table is updated to have the first integer in `arr` as key and `k` as value. Otherwise, no changes are made to the frequency_table, the frequency_table is updated to have the second integer in `arr` as key and its frequency increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` still contains at least 2 integers, and the value of `k` is still between 2 and 100. All elements in `arr` are still between 1 and 100. The frequency_table is updated to include the second integer in `arr` with its frequency increased by 1. If the frequency of the first integer in `arr` is greater than `k`, the frequency_table still has the first integer in `arr` as key and `k` as value. Otherwise, the frequency_table remains unchanged for the first integer in `arr`.
