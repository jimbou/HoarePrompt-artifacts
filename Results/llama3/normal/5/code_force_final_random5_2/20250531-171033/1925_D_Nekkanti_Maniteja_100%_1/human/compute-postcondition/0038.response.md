Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer that must be at least k + 1, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k, stdin contains no more test cases.**

The code snippet first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k, respectively. Then, it sets M to 10^9 + 7. The value of c is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M. The variables s and a are initialized to 0. The values of u, v, f, and i remain unchanged. Since stdin is empty after reading the three integers, it contains no more test cases.
