Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is 2 * `c * a + c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 1, stdin contains no more test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the additional terms `c * i * c * m` and `c * a`, which are added to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The modular multiplicative inverse `c` is still equal to the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f`, and `i` are unchanged, and there are no more test cases in the stdin.
