To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer that must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `k` remains the same, but we can refine its lower bound to be at least 3, since `i` is now 2.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is 2 * `c * a + c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 2, stdin contains no more test cases**
