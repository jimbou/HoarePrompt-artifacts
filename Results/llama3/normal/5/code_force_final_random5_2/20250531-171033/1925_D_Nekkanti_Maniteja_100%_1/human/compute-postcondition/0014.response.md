Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `3 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m * f`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - m, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to include an additional term `c * i * c * m + c * a`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now a more complex expression involving the original value of `a`, the modular multiplicative inverse `c`, and the values of `i`, `m`, and `f`. The input stream still contains multiple test cases, and the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `u`, and `v` are unchanged.
