This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of multiple lines. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, m, k) and then m lines of three integers each. It calculates a value 's' based on these inputs and prints the result modulo M (10^9 + 7). The function repeats this process for all test cases and outputs the sum of all results modulo M.
