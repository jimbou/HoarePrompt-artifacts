Output: **n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is k * c * a + (k - 1) * c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m, a is the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k - 1, stdin contains no more test cases, and this is printed: the value of s modulo M, where s is k * c * a + (k - 1) * c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, a is the sum of all f values, i is k - 1, and M is 1000000007**
