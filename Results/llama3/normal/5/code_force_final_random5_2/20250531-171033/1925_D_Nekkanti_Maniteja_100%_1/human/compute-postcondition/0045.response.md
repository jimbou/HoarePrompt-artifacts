Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer that must be at least k + 1, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is f + f + ... + f (m times), u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is m, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable 'a' will hold the sum of 'm' number of 'f' values, and the loop counter 'i' will be equal to 'm'. All other variables remain unchanged.
