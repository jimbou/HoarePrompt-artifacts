Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is k * c * a + (k - 1) * c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m, a is the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k - 1, stdin contains no more test cases**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following conditions:

- `n` remains an integer.
- `m` is still greater than or equal to 0.
- `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times.
- `M` remains 1000000007.
- `c` is still the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo `M`.
- `s` has accumulated the sum of `c * a` and `c * m * c * i` for `k` iterations, with the last iteration adding `c * i * c * m`.
- `a` remains the sum of all `f` values.
- `u`, `v`, and `f` are still integers.
- `i` has reached `k - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times.
- The stdin still contains no more test cases.

In natural language, the loop has executed `k` times, accumulating the sum of `c * a` and `c * m * c * i` for each iteration, and the value of `i` has reached `k - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
