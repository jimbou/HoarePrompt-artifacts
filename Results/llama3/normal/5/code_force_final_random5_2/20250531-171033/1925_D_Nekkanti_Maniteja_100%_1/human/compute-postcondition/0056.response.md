Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is the sum of all the output states after each iteration, modulo M.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the sum of all the output states after each iteration, modulo M. This means that the loop has finished executing, and the final output state is the result of all the iterations combined, taken modulo M.
