Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the first line of the input, which is split into three integers. The value of `M` is set to 1000000007, which is a large prime number often used in modular arithmetic. The value of `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, which is a value that, when multiplied by `n * (n - 1) // 2`, gives a result of 1 modulo `M`. The values of `s` and `a` are both set to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. Finally, the state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one test case has been consumed, leaving multiple test cases remaining.
