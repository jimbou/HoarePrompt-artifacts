Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is `k` * `c` * `m` * (`c` * `m` + `f` * `m`) + `k` * (`k` - 1`) * `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` + `k` * `c` * `a`, `a` is `f` + `f` + ... + `f` (`m` times), `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k` - 1, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed**
