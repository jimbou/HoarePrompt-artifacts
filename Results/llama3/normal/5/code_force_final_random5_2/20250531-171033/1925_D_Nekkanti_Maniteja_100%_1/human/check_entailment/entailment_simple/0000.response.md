Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
2.  It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) modulo `M` (`10 ** 9 + 7`) and stores it in `c`. This is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.
3.  It initializes a variable `s` to store the expected sum of friendship values and another variable `a` to store the sum of initial friendship values.
4.  It reads the `m` pairs of friends and their friendship values, adding the friendship values to `a`.
5.  It calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each excursion by iterating `k` times. In each iteration, it adds the product of the current excursion number `i`, the probability of choosing a pair of friends `c`, and the sum of initial friendship values `a` to `s`. It also adds the product of the probability of choosing a pair of friends `c`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the probability of choosing a pair of friends `c` to `s`. This correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each excursion.
6.  Finally, it prints the expected sum of friendship values modulo `M` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
