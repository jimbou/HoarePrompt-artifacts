Output: **the value of s modulo M (where s is the cumulative sum of the terms c * m * (c * m + f * m) and c * i * c * m + c * a for all iterations of the loop, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, m is greater than or equal to 0, f is an integer, i is k - 1, a is f + f + ... + f (m times), k is an integer that must be at least k, and M is 1000000007)**
