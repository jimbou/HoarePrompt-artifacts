Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is `c` * `m` * (`c` * `m` + `f` * `m`) + `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a`, `a` is `f` + `f` + ... + `f` (`m` times), `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 1**

The value of `s` has been updated by adding the product of `c`, `i`, `c`, and `m`, as well as the product of `c` and `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
