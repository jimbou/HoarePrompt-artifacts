Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is `c` * `m` * (`c` * `m` + `f` * `m`), `a` is `f` + `f` + ... + `f` (`m` times), `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the product of `c`, `m`, and the sum of `c` * `m` and `f` * `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
