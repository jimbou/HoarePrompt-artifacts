Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is f + f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - m - 3**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, M, c, s, and i remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of a is updated to be the sum of its original value f and the new value f, resulting in a being equal to 2f. The values of u and v are updated to be integers from the input, and f is also updated to be an integer from the input. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, from m - 2 to m - 3.
