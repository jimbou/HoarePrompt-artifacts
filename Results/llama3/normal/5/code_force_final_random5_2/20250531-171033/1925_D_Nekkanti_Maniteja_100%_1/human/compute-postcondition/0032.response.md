Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is 3 * `c * a + 2 * c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 2, stdin contains no more test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include additional terms involving `c`, `a`, `m`, and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now a more complex expression involving the modular multiplicative inverse `c` and the other variables.
