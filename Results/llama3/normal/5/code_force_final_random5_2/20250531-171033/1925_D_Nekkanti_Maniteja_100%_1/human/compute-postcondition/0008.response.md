Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is the original value of a plus m * f, i is m - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - m, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for n, k, M, and c as in the initial state. The value of m will be greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least m times. The value of s will remain 0. The value of a will be the original value of a plus m times the value of f, indicating that the loop has added the value of f to a, m times. The value of i will be m - 1, indicating that the loop has executed m times. The value of stdin will be multiple test cases - m, indicating that the loop has consumed m test cases from the input. The values of u, v, and f will be integers, indicating that the loop has processed m sets of integers.
