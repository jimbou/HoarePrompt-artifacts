Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m * f`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - m, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the product of `c`, `i`, `c`, and `m`, as well as the product of `c` and `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still 0, so the term `c * i * c * m` is also 0, simplifying the expression for `s` to just `c * a`.
