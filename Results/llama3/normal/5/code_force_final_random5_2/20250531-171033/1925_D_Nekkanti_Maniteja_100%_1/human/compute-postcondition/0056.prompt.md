Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains multiple lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k. The next m lines contain three integers each.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is k * c * i * c * m + (k - 1) * c * a, a is the original value of a plus m * f, i is k - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - m, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, and the remainder of s divided by M is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is k * c * a + (k - 1) * c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m, a is the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is k - 1, stdin contains no more test cases, and this is printed: the value of s modulo M, where s is k * c * a + (k - 1) * c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, a is the sum of all f values, i is k - 1, and M is 1000000007

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is `k` * `c` * `m` * (`c` * `m` + `f` * `m`) + `k` * (`k` - 1`) * `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` + `k` * `c` * `a`, `a` is `f` + `f` + ... + `f` (`m` times), `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k` - 1, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
