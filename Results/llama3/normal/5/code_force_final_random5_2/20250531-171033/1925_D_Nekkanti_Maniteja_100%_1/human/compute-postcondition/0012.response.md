Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`, `a` is the original value of `a` plus `m * f`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - m, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `s` is updated to be twice the original value of `c * i * c * m + c * a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - m.
