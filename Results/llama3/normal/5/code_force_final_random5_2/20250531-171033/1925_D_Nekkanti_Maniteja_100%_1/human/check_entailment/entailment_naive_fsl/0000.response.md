Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the line where the sum `s` is calculated. The correct formula for the expected value should be `s = c * (a + m * (k - 1) / 2) * k`, where `c` is the probability of choosing a pair of friends, `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values, `m` is the number of pairs of friends, and `k` is the number of excursions.

The program incorrectly calculates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m` and `c * a` in each iteration of the loop, which does not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

A correct implementation would be:

```
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = c * (a + m * (k - 1) // 2) * k % M
        print(s)
```

This corrected implementation accurately calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
