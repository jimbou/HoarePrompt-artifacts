Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * m * c * i`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains no more test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `c * a + c * m * c * i`, which is the result of the expression `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still 0, so the term `c * m * c * i` is 0, and the value of `s` is simply `c * a`.
