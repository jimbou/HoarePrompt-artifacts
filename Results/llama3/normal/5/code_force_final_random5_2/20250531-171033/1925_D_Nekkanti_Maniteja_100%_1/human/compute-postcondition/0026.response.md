Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is m - 1, stdin contains no more test cases.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is still 0. The value of `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input test cases. The values of `u` and `v` are still integers, and `f` is still an integer. The loop counter `i` has reached `m - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `m` times. Finally, there are no more test cases in the standard input.
