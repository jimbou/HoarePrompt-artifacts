Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least k + 1, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is f + f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains no more test cases.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of three integers from stdin to u, v, and f, respectively. Since stdin contains no more test cases, this line does not affect the state of stdin. The second line increments a by the value of f. Since a was initially equal to f, a becomes f + f. No other variables are affected by the code block.
