Output State: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is `k * c * a + (k - 1) * c * m * c * i`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k - 1`, stdin contains no more test cases.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `s` has accumulated the sum of `k` iterations of the loop, where each iteration adds `c * a` and `c * m * c * i` to `s`. The variable `i` has been incremented `k` times, and the other variables remain unchanged.
