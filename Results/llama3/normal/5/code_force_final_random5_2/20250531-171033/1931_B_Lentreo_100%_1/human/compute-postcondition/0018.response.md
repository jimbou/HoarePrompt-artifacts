Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums and must be greater than 0, total is the sum of the integers in nums, mean is the sum of the integers in nums divided by the length of nums, i is n, and curr is the sum of nums[i] - mean for all i in range(n)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of non-negative integers `nums` and the length of `nums` `n` remain unchanged. The sum of the integers in `nums` `total` and the mean of the integers in `nums` `mean` also remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` is now equal to the length of `nums` `n`. The variable `curr` is now the sum of the differences between each integer in `nums` and the mean of `nums`, which is calculated by iterating over all integers in `nums`.
