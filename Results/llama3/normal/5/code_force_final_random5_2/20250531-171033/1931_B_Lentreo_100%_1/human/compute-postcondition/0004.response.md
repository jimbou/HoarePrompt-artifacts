Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of the integers in nums, mean is the sum of the integers in nums divided by the length of nums, and curr is 0**

The code assigns the value of `total // n` to `mean`, which is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`. Since the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, the remainder of the division is 0, and `mean` becomes the exact average of the integers in `nums`. The second line assigns 0 to `curr`, which does not affect any other variables. The values of `nums`, `n`, and `total` remain unchanged.
