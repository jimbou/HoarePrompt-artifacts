To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than 0, it must also be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`nums`, `total`, `mean`, and `curr`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`, and `i` is 2**
