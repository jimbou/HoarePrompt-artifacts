Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, the program returns 'NO' because it is impossible to distribute the water evenly.

If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have. It then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current container's amount and the mean. If at any point this cumulative difference is negative, the program returns 'NO' because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to distribute to the current container.

If the program iterates through all containers without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES' because it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge case where the number of containers is 1. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
