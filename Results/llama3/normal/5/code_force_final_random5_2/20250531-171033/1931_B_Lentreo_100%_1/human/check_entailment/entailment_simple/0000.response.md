Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. If the total sum is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the containers from left to right, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the mean. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the mean level, so the program returns 'NO'.

4. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from previous containers to later containers, so the program returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
