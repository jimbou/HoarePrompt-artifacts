Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether a list of non-negative integers can be rearranged to form a sequence where each element is equal to the mean of the list.

The program first checks if the sum of the integers in the list is divisible by the length of the list. If it's not, the program returns 'NO' because it's impossible to make all elements equal.

If the sum is divisible by the length, the program calculates the mean of the list. Then, it iterates over the list, keeping track of the cumulative difference between each element and the mean. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, the program returns 'NO' because it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container equal to the mean.

If the program finishes iterating over the list without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to make all elements equal to the mean, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
