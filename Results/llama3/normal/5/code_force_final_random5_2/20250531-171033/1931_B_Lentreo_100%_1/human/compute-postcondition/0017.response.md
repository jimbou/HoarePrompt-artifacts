Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`, `i` is 2. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `curr` which is increased by `nums[2] - mean`.***
