Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using a specific operation. The operation allows pouring any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers (n) and the amounts of water in each container (nums).

3. The function func_1 is called with the list of water amounts (nums) as an argument.

4. Inside func_1, the total amount of water is calculated by summing up all the elements in nums. If the total amount is not divisible by the number of containers (n), the function immediately returns 'NO', because it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

5. If the total amount is divisible by n, the mean amount of water per container is calculated by dividing the total amount by n.

6. The function then iterates over the list of water amounts. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount and the mean amount (curr += nums[i] - mean). If at any point the cumulative difference (curr) becomes negative, the function returns 'NO', because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container's amount equal to the mean.

7. If the function iterates over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
