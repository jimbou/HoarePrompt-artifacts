Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total sum of the numbers is divisible by the count of numbers. If not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

2. It then calculates the mean of the numbers by dividing the total sum by the count of numbers.

3. The program then iterates over the numbers, keeping a running total of the difference between each number and the mean. If this running total ever becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to pour into the current container to make it equal to the mean, so it returns 'NO'.

4. If the program finishes iterating over the numbers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make all the containers equal to the mean by pouring water from previous containers into later containers, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
