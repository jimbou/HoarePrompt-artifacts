Postcondition: ***nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums and must be greater than 0, total is the sum of the integers in nums, mean is the sum of the integers in nums divided by the length of nums, and i is 1. If curr (2 * nums[1] - 2 * (total / n)) is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, no change is made.***
