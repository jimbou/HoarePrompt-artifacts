Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of the integers in nums, and the sum of the integers in nums is divisible by the length of nums.**

The code assigns the length of the list `nums` to the variable `n` and the sum of the integers in `nums` to the variable `total`. Since the sum of the integers in `nums` is initially divisible by the length of `nums`, this property remains true after the code execution. The list `nums` itself remains unchanged.
