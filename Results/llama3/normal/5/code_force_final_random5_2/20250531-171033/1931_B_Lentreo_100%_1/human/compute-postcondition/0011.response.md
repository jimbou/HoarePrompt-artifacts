Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `curr` is updated by adding `nums[i] - mean` to its current value.
2. Since `i` is 1, `nums[i]` is `nums[1]`.
3. `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`, which is `total / n`.

Now, let's calculate the new value of `curr`:

`curr` = `curr` + `nums[1]` - `mean`
= `nums[1] - mean` + `nums[1]` - `mean` (since `curr` is initially `nums[1] - mean`)
= 2 * `nums[1]` - 2 * `mean`

Since `mean` is `total / n`, we can substitute this expression:

`curr` = 2 * `nums[1]` - 2 * (`total / n`)

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`, `curr` is 2 * `nums[1]` - 2 * (`total / n`), and `i` is 1.**

Note that we've updated the value of `curr` to its new expression, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
