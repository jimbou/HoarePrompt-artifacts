Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. It first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

2. It then calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have.

3. It iterates through the containers, keeping a running total of the difference between the current container's amount and the mean. If this running total ever becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container's amount equal to the mean, so it returns 'NO'.

4. If it finishes iterating through all the containers without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'YES'.

This logic is sound, and the program correctly implements it. Therefore, the program is correct.
