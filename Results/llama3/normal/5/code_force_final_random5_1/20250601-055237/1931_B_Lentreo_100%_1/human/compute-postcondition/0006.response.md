The code `curr += nums[i] - mean` increments the value of `curr` by the difference between the first element of `nums` and the mean of `nums`. Since `i` is 0, `nums[i]` refers to the first element of `nums`. The mean of `nums` is the sum of its elements divided by its length.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`, and `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`.**
