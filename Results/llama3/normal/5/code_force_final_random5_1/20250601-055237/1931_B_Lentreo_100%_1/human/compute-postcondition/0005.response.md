To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `n` is the length of `nums`, which is a list of non-negative integers. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, which means `nums` must have at least one element. Additionally, `i` is the loop variable, which starts from 0.

The other variables, `total`, `mean`, and `curr`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`, and `curr` is 0**
