Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`. The current value of `curr` is less than 0, which is the result of subtracting the mean from the first element of `nums`***
