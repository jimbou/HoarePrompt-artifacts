Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`, `curr` is increased by the value of the third element in `nums` minus the mean of the integers in `nums`.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated by adding the difference between the third element in `nums` and the mean of the integers in `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
