Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, it immediately returns 'NO' because it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Then, it calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have. It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.

The program then iterates over the containers from left to right. For each container, it adds the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean to `curr`. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container's water amount equal to the mean, so it returns 'NO'.

If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
