Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of the integers in nums, mean is the sum of the integers in nums divided by the length of nums, i is n, and curr is the sum of the differences between each integer in nums and the mean of the integers in nums.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `nums`, and the variable `curr` has accumulated the sum of the differences between each integer in `nums` and the mean of the integers in `nums`. The loop has not returned 'NO', indicating that `curr` was never less than 0 during the iterations. The other variables, `nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
