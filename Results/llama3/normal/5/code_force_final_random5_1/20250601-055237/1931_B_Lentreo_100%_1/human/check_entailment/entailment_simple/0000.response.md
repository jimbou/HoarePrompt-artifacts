Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first checks if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, the program returns 'NO'. This is because if the sum is not divisible by the number of containers, it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

If the sum is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the mean amount of water in each container. It then iterates over the containers, calculating the cumulative difference between the amount of water in each container and the mean. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is because if the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the amount of water in the current container equal to the mean.

If the program iterates over all containers without the cumulative difference becoming negative, it returns 'YES'. This is because it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the previous containers to the current container.

Correctness: **True**
