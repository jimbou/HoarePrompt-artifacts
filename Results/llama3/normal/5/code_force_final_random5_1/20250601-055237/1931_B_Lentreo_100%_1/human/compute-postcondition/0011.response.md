The code `curr += nums[i] - mean` updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between the `i-th` element of `nums` and the `mean` to its current value. Since `i` is 1, we are adding the difference between the second element of `nums` and the `mean` to `curr`. The value of `curr` was initially `nums[0] - mean`, so now it becomes `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean`, which simplifies to `nums[0] + nums[1] - 2 * mean`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`, and `curr` is `nums[0] + nums[1] - 2 * mean`, which is greater than or equal to 0.**
