Postcondition: ***nums is a list of non-negative integers with at least 1 element, n is greater than 2, i is 2, total is the sum of the integers in nums, mean is the sum of the integers in nums divided by the length of nums, curr is increased by the value of the third element in nums minus the mean of the integers in nums. If curr is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
