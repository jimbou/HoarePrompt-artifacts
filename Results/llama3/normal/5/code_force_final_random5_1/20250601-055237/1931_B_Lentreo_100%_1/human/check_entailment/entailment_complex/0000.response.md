Reasoning:

The function `func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `nums` as input and determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The function first checks if the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`. If it is not, the function returns 'NO'. This is correct because if the sum is not divisible by the length, it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

If the sum is divisible by the length, the function calculates the mean of the integers in `nums` by dividing the sum by the length. It then initializes a variable `curr` to 0 and iterates over the integers in `nums`. For each integer, it adds the difference between the integer and the mean to `curr`. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, the function returns 'NO'. This is correct because if `curr` becomes negative, it means that the amount of water in some container is less than the mean, and it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.

If the function completes the iteration over `nums` without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES'. This is correct because if the function has not returned 'NO' by this point, it means that the amount of water in all containers can be made the same by pouring water from one container to another.

Therefore, the function is correct and will return the correct result for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
