Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `mean` is the sum of the integers in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `nums`, `n`, `i`, `total`, `mean`, and `curr`.***
