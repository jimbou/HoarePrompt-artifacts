Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of the integers in nums, mean is the sum of the integers in nums divided by the length of nums, and curr is 0**

The code calculates the mean of the integers in the list `nums` by dividing the total sum of the integers by the length of the list `n`, and assigns this value to the variable `mean`. The variable `curr` is initialized to 0. The values of `nums`, `n`, and `total` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
