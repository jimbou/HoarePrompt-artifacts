Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.

3. The program then calls the function `func_1` with `nums` as the argument.

4. Inside `func_1`, it calculates the total amount of water `total` and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO' because it is impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

5. If `total` is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water `mean` that each container should have.

6. It then initializes a variable `curr` to 0 and iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it adds the difference between the current amount and the mean to `curr`.

7. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container have the mean amount, so it returns 'NO'.

8. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without `curr` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
