Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than i + 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, i is i + 1, idx1 is i, p1 is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1` and sets `p1` to 1. No other variables are affected. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but this change is not reflected in the output state as it is not explicitly mentioned in the code. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1` is not executed as there is no `p2` defined in the code.
