Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is set to i, p1 is set to 1, and p2 remains 0. Otherwise, idx2 is set to i, p1 remains 0, and p2 is set to 1.**
