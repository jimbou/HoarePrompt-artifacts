Postcondition: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, or continues execution if either `idx1` or `idx2` is negative. In the case of breaking out, the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
