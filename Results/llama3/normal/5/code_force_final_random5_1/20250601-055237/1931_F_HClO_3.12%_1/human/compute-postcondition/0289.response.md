Postcondition: **`val` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is at least 0, `idx2` is at least 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input, stdin contains no input. The current value of `a1` and `a2` are both in `l3`. The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
