Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input. The current value of a1 and a2 are in l3 and the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2.**

In this output state, the value of `l1` has been modified by inserting `a1` at index `idx2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `l` is assigned the modified value of `l1`. The other variables, including `t`, `n`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3`, retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
