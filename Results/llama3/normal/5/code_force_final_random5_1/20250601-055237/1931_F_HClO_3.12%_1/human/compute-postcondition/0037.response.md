Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then the current value of `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` remains 0. Otherwise, the current value of `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` is set to 1. Both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
