Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: val is updated with m-2 new tuples containing the integer a3 and the list l3, which are obtained from the input. The input is consumed, and stdin is now empty. m is equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`val` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`, `m` is 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`val` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `m` is 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`val` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `m` is 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
