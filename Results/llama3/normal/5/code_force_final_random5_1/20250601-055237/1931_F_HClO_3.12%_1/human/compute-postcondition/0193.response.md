To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than `m - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `m` remains the same, but since `_` has increased, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `idx2` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers, `val` is a list of tuples containing `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `'no'` is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `i` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1**
