Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code assigns the values of `n` and `m` to the integers obtained from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
