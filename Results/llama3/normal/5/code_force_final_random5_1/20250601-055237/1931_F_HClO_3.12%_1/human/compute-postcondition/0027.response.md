Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and stdin is empty. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The current value of l1[i + p1] is not equal to the current value of l2[i + p2].**
