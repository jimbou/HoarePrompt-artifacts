Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is 2 and `idx2` is 2. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
