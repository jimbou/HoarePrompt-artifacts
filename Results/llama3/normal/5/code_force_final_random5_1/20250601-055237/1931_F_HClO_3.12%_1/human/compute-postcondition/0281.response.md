Output State: **val is an empty list, l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2, a3 is an integer, t is greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers equal to l with a1 inserted at index idx2, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is at least 0 and greater than idx2, idx2 is at least 0, p1 is 1, p2 is 1, i is n - 1.**

In this output state, the list `l` is updated to be equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. The list `l1` is also updated to be equal to `l` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
