Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`, `m` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'no' is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement. Additionally, the statement 'no' is being printed, which was already being printed in the initial state.
