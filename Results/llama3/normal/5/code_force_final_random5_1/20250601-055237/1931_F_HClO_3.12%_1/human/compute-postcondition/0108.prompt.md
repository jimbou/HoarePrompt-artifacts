Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and all the newly appended tuples (a3, l3), m is 2, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, and stdin is empty except for the consumed input.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is 2, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `stdin` is empty except for the consumed input, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and all the newly appended tuples (a3, l3) that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple. If the current value of `l3` is equal to the list of integers `l` excluding `a3`, then the program continues to execute. Otherwise, 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is 2, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `stdin` is empty except for the consumed input, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and all the newly appended tuples (a3, l3) that must have at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple. If the current value of `l3` is equal to the list of integers `l` excluding `a3`, then the program continues to execute. Otherwise, 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is 2, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `stdin` is empty except for the consumed input, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and all the newly appended tuples (a3, l3) that must have at least 3 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
