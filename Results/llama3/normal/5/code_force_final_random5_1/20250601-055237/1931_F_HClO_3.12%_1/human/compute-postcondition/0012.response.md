Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `stdin` is not empty, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 0**

The code `input()` accepts a line of input from the user, but does not assign it to any variable. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, but the stdin is no longer empty as it now contains the input provided by the user.
