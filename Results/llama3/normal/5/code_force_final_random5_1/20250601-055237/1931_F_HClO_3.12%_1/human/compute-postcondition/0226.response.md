Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is at least 4, stdin is empty**

The code `input()` reads a line from the standard input and discards it, effectively consuming the input. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains one input, after executing the code, stdin becomes empty. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
