Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
