Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` strings if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in `l2`. Either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`**

The code modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The value of `idx2` is now `i`, and the value of `p2` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
