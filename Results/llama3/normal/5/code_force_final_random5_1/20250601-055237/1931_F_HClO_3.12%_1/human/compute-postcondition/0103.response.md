To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `val`. If `val` has at least one more tuple, the loop executes again.

At the end of the last iteration, `val` has at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple, and `l3` is the second element of the second tuple.

For the loop to execute again, `val` must have at least 3 tuples. The new values of `a3` and `l3` will be the first and second elements of the third tuple, respectively.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is 2, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `stdin` is empty except for the consumed input, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and all the newly appended tuples (a3, l3) that must have at least 3 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple.**
