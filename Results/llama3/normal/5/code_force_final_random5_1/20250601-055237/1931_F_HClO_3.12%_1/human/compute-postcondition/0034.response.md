Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is -1, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, and p2 is 1, and stdin is empty.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, and the second line sets `p2` to 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state's conditions and values for `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, and `p1` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
