Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or the value of i where l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, idx2 is either -1 or the value of i where l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is n - 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1, and l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then m is decreased by 1, and if m is equal to 1, then 'yes' is being printed and i is n. In this case, the index of a1 in l3 is either less than or not less than the index of a2 in l3. If the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. If the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or the value of i where l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, idx2 is either -1 or the value of i where l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is greater than or equal to 3, l is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is n - 1, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or the value of i where l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, idx2 is either -1 or the value of i where l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is greater than or equal to 4, l is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is n - 1, _ is 1, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or the value of i where l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, idx2 is either -1 or the value of i where l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is greater than or equal to 4, l is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is n - 1, _ is 2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, val now contains a new tuple (a3, l3) where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
