Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, val is an empty list, a3 is the first element of the last tuple, l3 is the second element of the last tuple, n is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

The code reads two lines of input from stdin, each containing a list of integers. The first line assigns the first integer to `a1` and the remaining integers to `l1`. The second line assigns the first integer to `a2` and the remaining integers to `l2`. The code then creates two new lists, `l11` and `l22`, by excluding `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `m`, `l`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and `n` remain unchanged. The code does not print anything or modify the values of any variables other than `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22`.
