Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is at least 0, `idx2` is at least 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except for `a3` and `l3`. `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l3` is assigned the list of remaining integers from the input. The stdin is now empty.
