Output State: **i is increased by 1, idx1 is equal to the original value of i, p1 is 1, and the values of p2, idx2, l1, a2, and n remain unchanged.**

In this output state, we have considered the impact of both lines of code on the program. The first line assigns the current value of `i` to `idx1`, effectively capturing the value of `i` at this point in the execution. The second line assigns the value 1 to `p1`. Since `i` is increased by 1, its new value is one more than its original value. The values of `p2`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` are not affected by the code and remain unchanged.
