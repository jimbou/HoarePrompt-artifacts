Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers. n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers. The constraints on `n` and `k` remain the same, i.e., 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5.
