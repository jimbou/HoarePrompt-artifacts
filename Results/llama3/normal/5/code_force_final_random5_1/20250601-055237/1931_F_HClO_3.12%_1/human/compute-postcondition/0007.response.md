The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected. The stdin still contains one input: a string. The 'yes' is still being printed. The loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is 1, stdin contains one input: a string, 'yes' is being printed, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
