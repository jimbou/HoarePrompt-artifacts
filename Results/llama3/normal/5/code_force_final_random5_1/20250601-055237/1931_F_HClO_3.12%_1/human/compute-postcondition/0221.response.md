Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers. If `m` is equal to 1, stdin contains one input: a string, 'yes' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
