The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, and `stdin` is empty.**
