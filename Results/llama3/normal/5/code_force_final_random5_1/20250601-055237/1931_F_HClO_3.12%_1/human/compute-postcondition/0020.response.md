Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `stdin` contains `m-2` inputs: strings, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to `m`, `_` is `m-2`, and 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables retain their original values, and the conditions `l11` is not equal to `l22` and `m` is greater than or equal to `m` are still valid. The `stdin` still contains `m-2` inputs: strings, and 'no' is still printed.
