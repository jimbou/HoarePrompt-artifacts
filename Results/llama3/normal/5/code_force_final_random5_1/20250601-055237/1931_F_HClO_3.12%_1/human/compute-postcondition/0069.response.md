Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2.**

The code first inserts `a1` at index `idx2` in `l1`, modifying `l1`. Then, it assigns the modified `l1` to a new variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
