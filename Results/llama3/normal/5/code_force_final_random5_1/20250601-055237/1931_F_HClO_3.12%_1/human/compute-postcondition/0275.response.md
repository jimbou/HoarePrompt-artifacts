Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is at least 0, `idx2` is at least 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `val`, `l`, `a3`, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `n - 1` times, and in each iteration, it checks if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. If they are not equal, it checks if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`. If both conditions are true, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, it sets `idx1` to `i` and `p1` to 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, it sets `idx2` to `i` and `p2` to 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made. After the loop finishes, `i` is `n - 1`, and `idx1` and `idx2` are at least 0.
