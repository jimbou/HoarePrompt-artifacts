Output State: **The loop finishes executing, and the program prints 'yes' if all tuples in `val` have a list `l3` equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, otherwise it prints 'no' and breaks out of the loop.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop will continue to execute until it has processed all the test cases in the input. For each test case, it will check if the lists of integers in the tuples in `val` are equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding the first element of the tuple. If all tuples pass this check, the program will print 'yes'. If any tuple fails this check, the program will print 'no' and break out of the loop. After processing all test cases, the loop will finish executing.
