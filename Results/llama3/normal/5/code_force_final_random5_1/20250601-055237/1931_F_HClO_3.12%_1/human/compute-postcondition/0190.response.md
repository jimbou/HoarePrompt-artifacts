Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or the value of i where l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, idx2 is either -1 or the value of i where l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is n - 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1, and l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then m is decreased by 1, and if m is equal to 1, then 'yes' is being printed and i is n. In this case, the index of a1 in l3 is either less than or not less than the index of a2 in l3. If the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. If the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1.***
