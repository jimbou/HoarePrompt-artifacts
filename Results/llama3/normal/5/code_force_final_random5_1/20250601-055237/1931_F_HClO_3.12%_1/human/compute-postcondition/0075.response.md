Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list. If `m` is 2, the program skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the rest of the code in the current iteration.***
