Output State: **val is a list of tuples, l is a list of integers, a3 is an integer, t is greater than 0, n is at least 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, i is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `val`, `l`, `a3`, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx2`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are that `idx1` is now equal to `i` (which is 0), and `p1` is now equal to 1.
