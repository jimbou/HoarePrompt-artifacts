The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `stdin` is not empty, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 1**
