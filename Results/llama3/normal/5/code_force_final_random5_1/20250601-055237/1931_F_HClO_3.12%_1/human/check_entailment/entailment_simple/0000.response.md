Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly handles the case when there is only one screenshot (m == 1) and prints 'yes'. It also correctly handles the case when there are two screenshots (m == 2) and checks if the lists l1 and l2 are equal after inserting a1 or a2 at the correct position. If they are not equal, it prints 'no'. If they are equal, it prints 'yes'. For more than two screenshots (m > 2), it correctly checks if the lists l3 are equal to the list l excluding a3 for all tuples in val. If any of them are not equal, it prints 'no' and breaks out of the loop. If all of them are equal, it prints 'yes'. 

Correctness: **True**
