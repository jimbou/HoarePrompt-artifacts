Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` remains 0. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `idx2` is set to `i`, `p2` is set to 1, and `p1` remains 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still increased by 1. The conditions for setting `idx1`, `p1`, and `p2` are still the same. However, we now break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
