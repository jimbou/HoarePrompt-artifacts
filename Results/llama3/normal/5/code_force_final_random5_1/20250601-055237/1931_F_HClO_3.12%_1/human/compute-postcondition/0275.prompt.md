Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `m` is at least `m`, stdin contains `m - 2` inputs: strings, and 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `m - 2` inputs: strings, and we are out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if both `idx1` and `idx2` are at least 0, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1. In both cases, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `idx1` or `idx2` is less than 0, then no changes are made. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is set to 1, `idx2` is set to 1, `p1` is set to 0, and `p2` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` is set to 0. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to 1, `p1` is set to 0, and `p2` is set to 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is 2 and `idx2` is 2. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
