Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `m` is 2, 'no' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the `break` statement. The `break` statement only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside. The fact that 'no' has been printed is still valid, as the `break` statement does not undo any previous output.
