Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than i + 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, i is i + 1, idx2 is i, p2 is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2` and sets `p2` to 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state's conditions, such as `t` being a positive integer greater than 0, `n` being an integer greater than `i + 2`, and the definitions of `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22`, remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1 as per the initial state's condition.
