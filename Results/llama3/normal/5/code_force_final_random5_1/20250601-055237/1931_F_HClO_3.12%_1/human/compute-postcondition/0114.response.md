Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple, `n` is an integer, and 'yes' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that we are now skipping to the next iteration of the loop.
