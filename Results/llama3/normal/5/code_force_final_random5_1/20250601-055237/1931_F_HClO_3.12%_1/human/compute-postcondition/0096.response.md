Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is 2, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `stdin` is empty except for the consumed input, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and all the newly appended tuples (a3, l3) that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple. The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of integers `l` excluding `a3`, and 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty except for the consumed input. The list `val` still contains tuples with `a3` and `l3`, and the current value of `l3` is still not equal to the list of integers `l` excluding `a3`. Additionally, 'no' is printed.
