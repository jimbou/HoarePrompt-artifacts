Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `m` is 2, 'no' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not affect the values of the variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. The values of `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain unchanged, and 'no' is still being printed.
