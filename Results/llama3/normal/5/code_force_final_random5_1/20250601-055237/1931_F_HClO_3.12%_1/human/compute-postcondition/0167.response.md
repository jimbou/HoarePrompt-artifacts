Postcondition: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remaining unchanged, or continues execution with `i` increased by 1 and `n` greater than `i`. If the program continues execution, either `idx1` is equal to the original value of `i`, `p1` is 1, and the values of `p2`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remain unchanged, or `idx2` is assigned the value of `i` and `p2` is set to 1. If `idx1` is less than 0 or `idx2` is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remaining unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`.**
