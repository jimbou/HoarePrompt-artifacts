Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is at least 0, `idx2` is at least 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is 2, and 'yes' is being printed. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes to the variables in the given code snippet, all the variables retain their initial values. The only effect of the `continue` statement is that the loop moves on to the next iteration.
