Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and stdin is empty. If l1[i + p1] equals l2[i + p2], no changes are made. If l1[i + p1] does not equal l2[i + p2], then if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, idx1 is set to i, idx2 is set to i, p1 is set to 0, and p2 is set to 0. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 but l2[i + p2] does not equal a1, then idx1 is set to i, p1 is set to 1, and p2 remains 0. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx2 is set to i, p1 remains 0, and p2 is set to 1. If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, no changes occur. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` remains 0. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx2` is set to `i`, `p2` is set to 1, and `p1` remains 0. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative or if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, then no action is taken. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
