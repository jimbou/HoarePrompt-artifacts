Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, stdin is empty. If l11 is not equal to l22, stdin contains m-2 inputs: strings, m is greater than or equal to m, _ is m-2, and 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.***
