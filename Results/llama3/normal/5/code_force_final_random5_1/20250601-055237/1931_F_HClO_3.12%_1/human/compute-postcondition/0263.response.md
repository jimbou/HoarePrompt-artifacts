Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is set to 1, `idx2` is set to 1, `p1` is set to 0, and `p2` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` is set to 0. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to 1, `p1` is set to 0, and `p2` is set to 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` remains 1.***
