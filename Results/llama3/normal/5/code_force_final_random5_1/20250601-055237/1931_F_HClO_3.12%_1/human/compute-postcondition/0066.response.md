Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1, and stdin is empty.**

The code inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`, effectively modifying `l2`. The second line assigns the modified `l2` to a new variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
