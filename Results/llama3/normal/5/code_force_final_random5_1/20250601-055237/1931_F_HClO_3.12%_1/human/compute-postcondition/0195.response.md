To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration variable, and `m`, which is used to determine the range of the loop.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 4.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `_` by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `m` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is still greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `idx2` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers, `val` is a list of tuples containing `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `'no'` is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `i` is `n - 1`, `_` is 2, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers**
