Postcondition: ***`val` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is at least 0, `idx2` is at least 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input, stdin contains no input. If `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l` is equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.***
