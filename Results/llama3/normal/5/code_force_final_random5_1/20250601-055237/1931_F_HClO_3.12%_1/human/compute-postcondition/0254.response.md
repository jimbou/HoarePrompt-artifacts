Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
