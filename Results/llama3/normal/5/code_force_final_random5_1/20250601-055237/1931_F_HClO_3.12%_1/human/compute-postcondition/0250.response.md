Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are at least 0, then the current value of `idx1` is `i` and the current value of `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise the current value of `idx2` is `i` and the current value of `p2` is 1. In both cases, the current value of `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `idx1` or `idx2` is less than 0, then no changes are made.***
