To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is at least 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3.


State: **`val`, `l`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `t` are as initially described, `m` must be at least 3**
