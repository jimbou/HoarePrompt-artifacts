Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. The current value of `idx1` is at least 0 and the current value of `idx2` is at least 0. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then the current value of `idx1` is `i` and the current value of `p1` is 1. Otherwise, the current value of `idx2` is `i` and the current value of `p2` is 1. In both cases, the current value of `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of breaking out of the loop or if statement.
