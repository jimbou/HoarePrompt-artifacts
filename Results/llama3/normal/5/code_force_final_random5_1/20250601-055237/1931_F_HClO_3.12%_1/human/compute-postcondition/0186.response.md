Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or the value of i where l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, idx2 is either -1 or the value of i where l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is n - 1, and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2. If m is equal to 2, then 'yes' is being printed and i is n. The index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3.**

The code inserts `a2` at index `idx1` in `l2` and assigns the modified `l2` to `l`. This changes the state of `l2` and `l`, while all other variables remain unaffected. The index of `a1` in `l3` is still not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, and all other conditions and values remain the same.
