Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `m` is 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
