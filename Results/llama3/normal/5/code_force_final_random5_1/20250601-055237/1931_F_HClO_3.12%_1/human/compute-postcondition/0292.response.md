Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `l` is `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is at least 0, `idx2` is at least 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input, stdin contains no input. `l3.index(a1)` is not less than `l3.index(a2)`**

The code modifies the list `l2` by inserting `a2` at index `idx1` and then assigns the modified `l2` to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
