Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is 2, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `stdin` is empty except for the consumed input, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple. If `l3` is equal to the list `l` excluding `a3`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be such that the list `val` will be empty, and the variables `a3` and `l3` will hold the values of the last tuple processed in the loop. If the last processed tuple's second element `l3` is equal to the list `l` excluding the first element `a3`, then the program will print 'yes'. Otherwise, it will print 'no' and break out of the loop. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
