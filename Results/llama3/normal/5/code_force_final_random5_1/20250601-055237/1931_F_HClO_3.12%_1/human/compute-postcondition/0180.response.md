Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `idx2` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is 2, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `i` is `n`, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and 'yes' is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop, without changing any variable values. The loop counter `i` is incremented to `n`, and the conditions for printing 'no' and skipping the iteration, and printing 'yes' are still valid.
