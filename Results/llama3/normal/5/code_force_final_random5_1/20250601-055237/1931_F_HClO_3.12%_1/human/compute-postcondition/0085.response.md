According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is an integer less than its original value by 1 if `idx1` <= `idx2`, otherwise `m` is an integer. This does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing `(a3, l3)` if `idx1` <= `idx2`, otherwise `val` is an empty list, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, and `stdin` is empty.**
