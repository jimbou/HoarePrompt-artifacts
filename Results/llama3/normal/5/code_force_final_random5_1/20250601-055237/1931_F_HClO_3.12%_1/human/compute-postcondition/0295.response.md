Postcondition: ***`val`, `l`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `t` are as initially described. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `val` is a list containing a tuple of `a3` and `l3`, `m` is one less than its original value, and if `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l` is equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.***
