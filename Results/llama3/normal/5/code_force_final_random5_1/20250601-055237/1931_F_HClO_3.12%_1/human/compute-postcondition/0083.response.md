Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) if idx1 <= idx2, otherwise val is an empty list, m is an integer less than its original value by 1 if idx1 <= idx2, otherwise m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 < idx2, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 >= idx2.***
