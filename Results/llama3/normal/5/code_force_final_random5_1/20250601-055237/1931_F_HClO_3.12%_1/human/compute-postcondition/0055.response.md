Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than i + 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, i is i + 1, idx1 is i, idx2 is i.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, or `l22`. The only changes are to `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `idx1` and `idx2` are assigned the new value of `i`.
