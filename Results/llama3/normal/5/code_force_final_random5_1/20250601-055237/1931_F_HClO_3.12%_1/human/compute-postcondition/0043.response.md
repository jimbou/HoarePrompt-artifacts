Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is increased by 1. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
