Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, stdin contains no input. The current value of `a1` and `a2` are in `l3` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`***
