Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `m` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the code in the current iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we continue to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the code in the current iteration. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
