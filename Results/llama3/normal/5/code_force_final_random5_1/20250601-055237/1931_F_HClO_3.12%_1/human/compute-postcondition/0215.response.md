The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop finishes executing, so `t` must be 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0**
