Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers. n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m == 1:
        input()
        print('yes')
        continue
    a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())
    a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())
    l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]
    l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]
    if l11 != l22:
        for _ in range(m - 2):
            input()
        print('no')
        continue
    idx1 = idx2 = -1
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
            break
        if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
                idx1 = idx2 = i
                break
            else:
                if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                    idx1 = i
                    p1 = 1
                else:
                    idx2 = i
                    p2 = 1
                if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                    break
    val = []
    if idx1 < idx2:
        l2.insert(idx1, a2)
        l = l2
    elif idx1 > idx2:
        l1.insert(idx2, a1)
        l = l1
    else:
        if m == 2:
            print('yes')
            continue
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):
            l1.insert(idx2, a1)
            l = l1
        else:
            l2.insert(idx1, a2)
            l = l2
        val.append((a3, l3))
        m -= 1
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        val.append((a3, l3))
    for a3, l3 in val:
        if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
            print('no')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is 2, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `stdin` is empty except for the consumed input, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple. If `l3` is equal to the list `l` excluding `a3`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop finishes executing, and the program prints 'yes' if all tuples in `val` have a list `l3` equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, otherwise it prints 'no' and breaks out of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is an empty list, `a3` and `l3` are not defined, `m` is 2, and 'yes' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
