Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) if idx1 <= idx2, otherwise val is an empty list, m is an integer less than its original value by 1 if idx1 <= idx2, otherwise m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and the newly appended tuple (a3, l3), m is an integer and is at least 3, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, and stdin is empty except for the consumed input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and the newly appended tuple (a3, l3), m is an integer and is at least 4, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, and stdin is empty except for the consumed input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) and the newly appended tuple (a3, l3), m is an integer and is at least 3, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, and stdin is empty except for the consumed input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
