Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, idx1 is either -1 or the value of i where l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, idx2 is either -1 or the value of i where l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1, val is an empty list, a3 is the first element of the last tuple, l3 is the second element of the last tuple, n is an integer, i is n - 1, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2.**

The code modifies the list l2 by inserting the value a2 at the position idx1. This change affects the list l2 and the list l, which is assigned the value of l2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
