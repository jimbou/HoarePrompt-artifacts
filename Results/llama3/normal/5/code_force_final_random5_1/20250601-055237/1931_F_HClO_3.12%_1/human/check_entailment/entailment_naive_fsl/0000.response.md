Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the number of screenshots (m) is greater than 2 and the order of participants in the screenshots is not consistent. 

For example, consider the input:

5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 1
3 4 5 1 2

In this case, the program will incorrectly print "yes" because it only checks the order of the first two screenshots and assumes that the order is consistent for all screenshots. However, the order of the third screenshot is different from the first two, which means that there is no consistent order that all screenshots correspond to.

The program should check the order of all screenshots, not just the first two, to ensure that there is a consistent order that all screenshots correspond to.
