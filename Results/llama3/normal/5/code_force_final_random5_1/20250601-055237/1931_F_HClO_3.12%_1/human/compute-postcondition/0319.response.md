Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `m` is 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
