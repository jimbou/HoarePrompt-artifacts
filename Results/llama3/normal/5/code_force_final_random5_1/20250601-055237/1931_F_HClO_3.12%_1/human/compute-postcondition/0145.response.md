Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either -1 or i, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, val is a list containing m - 2 strings if l11 is not equal to l22, otherwise val is an empty list, a3 is the first element of the last tuple, l3 is the second element of the last tuple, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is 0. The current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n minus 1. If idx1 and idx2 are both greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either the element at index i + p1 in l1 is equal to a2 and the element at index i + p2 in l2 is equal to a1, or either the element at index i + p1 in l1 is equal to a2 or the element at index i + p1 in l1 is not equal to a2 and the element at index i + p2 in l2 is not equal to a1.***
