Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `stdin` contains one input: a string, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `_` is 2**

The code `input()` accepts a string input from the user, which is not assigned to any variable. The values of all variables remain the same, but the stdin now contains one input: a string.
