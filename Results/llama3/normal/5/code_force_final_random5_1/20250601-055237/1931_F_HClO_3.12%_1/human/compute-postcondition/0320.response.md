Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` and `l3` are not defined, `m` is 2, and 'yes' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `val` is empty because all its tuples have been processed. The variables `a3` and `l3` are no longer defined because they were only defined within the scope of the loop. The variable `m` remains unchanged with a value of 2. Finally, since the loop completed all its iterations without finding any tuple where `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, the program prints 'yes'.
