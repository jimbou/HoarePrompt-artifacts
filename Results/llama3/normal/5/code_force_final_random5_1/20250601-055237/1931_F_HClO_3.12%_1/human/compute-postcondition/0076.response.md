Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and the variable `l3` is assigned the rest of the integers from the input as a list. The stdin is now empty, meaning it contains no input.
