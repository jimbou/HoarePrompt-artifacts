Postcondition: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, or continues execution if this condition is not met. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to the current value of `i` and `p1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to the current value of `i` and `p2` is set to 1.**
