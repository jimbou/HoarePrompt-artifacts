Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `val`, `l`, `a3`, and `t` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `n` and `m` from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
