Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` remains 0. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx2` is set to `i`, `p2` is set to 1, and `p1` remains 0. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative or if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
