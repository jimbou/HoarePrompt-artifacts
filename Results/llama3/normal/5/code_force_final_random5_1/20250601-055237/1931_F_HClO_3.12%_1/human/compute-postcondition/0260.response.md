Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` is set to 0. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to 1, `p1` is set to 0, and `p2` is set to 1. `i` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but the values of the variables remain unchanged.
