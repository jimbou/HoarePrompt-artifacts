Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input. If the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1. l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list.***
