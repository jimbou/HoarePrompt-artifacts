Postcondition: ***The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, or continues execution if `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is not equal to `n` minus 1. In the case of breaking out, the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remain unchanged. If the program continues execution, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`.***
