To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for _ in range(m - 2):`

The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 4.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2.

The value of `m` does not change, but since `_` has been incremented, the condition `m - 2` needs to be re-evaluated. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5 (since `_` is now 2).

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `stdin` is empty, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `_` is 2**
