Output State: **val is a list containing a tuple of a3 and l3, m is one less than its original value, l is a list of integers, a3 is an integer, t is greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is at least 0, idx2 is at least 0, p1 is 1, p2 is 1, i is n - 1, stdin contains no input. If l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2), then l is equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l is equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

In this output state, the value of `val` has been modified to include a tuple containing the value of `a3` and the list `l3`. The value of `m` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
