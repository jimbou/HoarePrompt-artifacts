Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, idx2 is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than n, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input, l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

The code inserts `a2` at index `idx1` in `l2`, modifying `l2`. It then assigns the modified `l2` to a new variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
