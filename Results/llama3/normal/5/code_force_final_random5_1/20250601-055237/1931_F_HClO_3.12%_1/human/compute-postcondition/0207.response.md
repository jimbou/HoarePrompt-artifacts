Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `idx2` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `val` is a list of tuples containing at least 2 tuples (a3, l3) where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers, `n` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The program will continue executing from the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
