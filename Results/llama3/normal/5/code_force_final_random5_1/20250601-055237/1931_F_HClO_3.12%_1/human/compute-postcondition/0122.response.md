Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `idx2` is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than `n`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 5, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if `idx1` < `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` > `idx2`, `val` is a list containing one string, `a3` is the first element of the last tuple, `l3` is the second element of the last tuple, `n` is an integer, a string has been read from stdin and returned.**

The code `input()` reads a string from stdin and returns it. Since a string has already been read from stdin and returned, the state of the variables remains the same, but the stdin is now empty.
