Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
