Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, val is a list containing m - 2 strings if l11 is not equal to l22, otherwise val is an empty list, a3 is the first element of the last tuple, l3 is the second element of the last tuple, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, and 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22.**

The code snippet resets the values of `idx1` and `idx2` to -1, and sets `p1` and `p2` to 0. This means that the indices and flags are reset to their initial states. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
