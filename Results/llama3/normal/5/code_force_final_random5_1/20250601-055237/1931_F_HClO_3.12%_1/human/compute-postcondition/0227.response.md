To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `m`. The loop will execute as long as the range `m - 2` has not been exhausted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 5, because the range `m - 2` must have at least one more element.

State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is at least 5, stdin is empty**
