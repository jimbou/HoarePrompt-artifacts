Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is i, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and stdin is empty.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, updating their values from `-1` to `i`. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and stdin remains empty.
