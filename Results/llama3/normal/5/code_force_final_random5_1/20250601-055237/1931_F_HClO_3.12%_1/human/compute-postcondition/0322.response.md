Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers. It then checks if the input data satisfies a specific condition, which is that all lines of integers are identical except for one element, and that element is present in the same position in all lines. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
