Output State: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, or continues execution if this condition is not met, idx1 is equal to the current value of `i`, and p1 is 1.**

In this output state, the program's control flow is determined by the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. If this condition is true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, it continues execution. Additionally, the value of `idx1` is set to the current value of `i`, and the value of `p1` is set to 1.
