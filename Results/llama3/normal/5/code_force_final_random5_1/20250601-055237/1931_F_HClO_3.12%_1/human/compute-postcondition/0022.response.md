Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, stdin is empty.**

The code initializes four new variables: `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` are set to -1, indicating that no index has been found yet. The values of `p1` and `p2` are set to 0, indicating that no progress has been made yet. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
