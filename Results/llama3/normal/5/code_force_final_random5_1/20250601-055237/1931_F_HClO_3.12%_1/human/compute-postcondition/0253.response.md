The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1**
