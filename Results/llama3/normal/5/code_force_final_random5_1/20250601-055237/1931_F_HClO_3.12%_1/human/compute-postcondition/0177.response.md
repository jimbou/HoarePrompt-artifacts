Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either -1 or the value of i where l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, idx2 is either -1 or the value of i where l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is 2, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, val is an empty list, a3 is the first element of the last tuple, l3 is the second element of the last tuple, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is n - 1, and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2***
