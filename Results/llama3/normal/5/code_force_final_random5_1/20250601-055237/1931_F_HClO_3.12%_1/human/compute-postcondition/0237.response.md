Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `m` is at least `m`, stdin contains `m - 2` inputs: strings, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the current loop or if statement.
