Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, val is a list containing m - 2 strings if l11 is not equal to l22, otherwise val is an empty list, a3 is the first element of the last tuple, l3 is the second element of the last tuple, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, and 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either -1 or i, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, m is an integer, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1 if idx1 < idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if idx1 > idx2, val is a list containing m - 2 strings if l11 is not equal to l22, otherwise val is an empty list, a3 is the first element of the last tuple, l3 is the second element of the last tuple, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input, 'no' is being printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop if l11 is not equal to l22, i is 0. The current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n minus 1. If idx1 and idx2 are both greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either the element at index i + p1 in l1 is equal to a2 and the element at index i + p2 in l2 is equal to a1, or either the element at index i + p1 in l1 is equal to a2 or the element at index i + p1 in l1 is not equal to a2 and the element at index i + p2 in l2 is not equal to a1. If l1[i + p1] is equal to l2[i + p2], then idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and the current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, or if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, in which case `idx1` is equal to `i` and `idx2` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, or continues execution if either `idx1` or `idx2` is negative. In the case of breaking out, the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remaining unchanged, or continues execution with `i` increased by 1 and `n` greater than `i`. If the program continues execution, either `idx1` is equal to the original value of `i`, `p1` is 1, and the values of `p2`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remain unchanged, or `idx2` is assigned the value of `i` and `p2` is set to 1. If `idx1` is less than 0 or `idx2` is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remaining unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the program continues execution with the updated values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` as described above.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
