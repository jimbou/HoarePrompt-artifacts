Output State: **The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, idx1 is equal to i, idx2 is equal to i.**

The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, and the second line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. The third line breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition that determines whether the program breaks out of the loop or if statement is not affected by the code snippet, so it remains the same as in the initial state.
