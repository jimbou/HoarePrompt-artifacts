Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2` from `l1`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1` from `l2`, `idx1` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `idx2` is either -1 or the value of `i` where `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `m` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `val` is a list of tuples containing at least 3 tuples (a3, l3) where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers, `n` is an integer, 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
