Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `m - 2` inputs: strings, and we are out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if both `idx1` and `idx2` are at least 0, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1. In both cases, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `idx1` or `idx2` is less than 0, then no changes are made. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, then no changes are made.***
