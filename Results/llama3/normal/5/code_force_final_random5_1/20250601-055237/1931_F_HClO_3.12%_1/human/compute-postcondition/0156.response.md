Postcondition: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, or if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, in which case `idx1` is equal to `i` and `idx2` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, or continues execution if either `idx1` or `idx2` is negative. In the case of breaking out, the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `a2`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
