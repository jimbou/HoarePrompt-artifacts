Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, and stdin is empty.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx1` and sets `p1` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1` is not met, so no changes are made to `idx2` or `p2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `stdin` are not affected by the code.
