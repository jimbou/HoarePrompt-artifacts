Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2 from l1, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1 from l2, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, and stdin is empty. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is set to i, idx2 is set to i, p1 is set to 0, and p2 is set to 0. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 but l2[i + p2] does not equal a1, then idx1 is set to i, p1 is set to 1, and p2 remains 0. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx2 is set to i, p1 remains 0, and p2 is set to 1. If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The current value of l1[i + p1] is not equal to the current value of l2[i + p2].***
