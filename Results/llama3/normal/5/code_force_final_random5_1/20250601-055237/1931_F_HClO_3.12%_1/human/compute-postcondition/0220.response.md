Output State: **`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains one input: a string, 'yes' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `val`, `l`, `a3`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains one input: a string. The 'yes' is still being printed.
