Postcondition: ***`val` is a list of tuples, `l` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `m` is at least `m`, stdin contains `m - 2` inputs: strings, and 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
