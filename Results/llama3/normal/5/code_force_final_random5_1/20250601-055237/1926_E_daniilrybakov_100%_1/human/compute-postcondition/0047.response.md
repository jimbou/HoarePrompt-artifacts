Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 2, k is an integer, m is 1, s is 0, t is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to the original value of n divided by 2, _ is any value plus 1**

The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `x`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `x` becomes a positive integer equal to the original value of `n` divided by 2. The second line divides `n` by 2, making `n` equal to its original value divided by 2. No other variables are affected.
