The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer equal to half of its original value, so for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0 and n's original value must be greater than 0.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to half of its original value which is greater than 0, k is an integer, m is 4, t is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to half of the original value of n plus 1 divided by 2, _ is any value plus 1, s is a value equal to its original value plus the original value of x plus x**
