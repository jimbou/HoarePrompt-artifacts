The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is any value, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` is still a positive integer.
State: **`_` is any value plus 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer and `k` <= `n*2^m`, `s` is less than `k` + `x` and `s` is equal to its original value plus `x`, `m` is a power of 2**
