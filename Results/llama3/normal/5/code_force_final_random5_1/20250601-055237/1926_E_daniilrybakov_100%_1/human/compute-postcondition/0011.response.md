Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0 and n is (n original value)//2, k is a positive integer and k <= n, s is less than k + x, m is 2, x is a positive integer equal to (n+1)//2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables maintain their original values and properties, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
