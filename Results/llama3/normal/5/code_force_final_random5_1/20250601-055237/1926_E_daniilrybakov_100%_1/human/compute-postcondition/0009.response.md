The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer and n is even, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0, k is a positive integer and k <= n, s is less than k + x, m is 2, x is a positive integer equal to (n+1)//2**
