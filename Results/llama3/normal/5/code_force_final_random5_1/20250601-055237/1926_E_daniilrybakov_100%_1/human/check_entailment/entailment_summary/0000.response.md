Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the position `k` of the card to be found.
3.  The program uses a while loop to find the correct category of cards (i.e., odd numbers, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) that the `k`-th card belongs to. This is done by calculating the number of cards in each category and checking if `k` falls within that range.
4.  Once the correct category is found, the program calculates the `k`-th card in that category using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, where `s` is the sum of cards in the previous categories and `m` is the multiplier for the current category (i.e., 1 for odd numbers, 2 for twice an odd number, etc.).
5.  The program prints the calculated `k`-th card for each test case.

The execution summary also confirms that the program reads input in batches, processes each batch correctly, and prints the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
