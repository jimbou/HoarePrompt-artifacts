The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t, then t pairs of integers n and k. Since the first input is an integer t, it is assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs in stdin are t pairs of integers n and k.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k, where n and k are positive integers and k <= n.**
