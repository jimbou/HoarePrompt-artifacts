Output State: **_ is any value plus 1, t is a positive integer, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 2, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, x is an integer equal to the original value of n plus 1 divided by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged as any value plus 1. The value of `t` also remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `n` is updated to be its original value divided by 2, and it is still a non-zero integer. The value of `k` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `s` remains unchanged as 0. The value of `m` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `x` is calculated as the original value of `n` plus 1 divided by 2.
