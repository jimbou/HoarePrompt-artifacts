The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer greater than 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **_ is any value plus 1, t is a positive integer, n is greater than 0, k is an integer, m is 4, x is an integer equal to the original value of n plus 1 divided by 2, s is an integer equal to the original value of x plus x**
