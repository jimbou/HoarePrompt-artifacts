Output State: **n is 0, k is an integer, m is a power of 2, t is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, _ is any value plus 1, s is a value equal to the sum of the original value of x and all the values of x from the previous iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n becomes 0, k remains an integer, m becomes a power of 2 (specifically, 2 to the power of the number of iterations), t remains a positive integer, x becomes a positive integer (specifically, the original value of n divided by 2 to the power of the number of iterations), _ remains any value plus 1, and s becomes the sum of the original value of x and all the values of x from the previous iterations.
