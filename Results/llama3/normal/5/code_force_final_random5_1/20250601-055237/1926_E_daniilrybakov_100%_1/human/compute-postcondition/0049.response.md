Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 2, `k` is an integer, `m` is 1, `s` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the original value of `n` divided by 2, `_` is any value plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `s` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `s` and `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `t`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the conditions `s` < `k` and `k` <= `s` + `x` still hold.
