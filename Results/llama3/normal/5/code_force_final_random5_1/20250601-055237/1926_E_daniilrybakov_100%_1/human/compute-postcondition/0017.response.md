Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0 and n is (n original value)//4 and n original value is greater than 1, k is a positive integer and k <= n*2, s is less than k + x, m is 4, x is a positive integer equal to (n*2+1)//4. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s + x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
