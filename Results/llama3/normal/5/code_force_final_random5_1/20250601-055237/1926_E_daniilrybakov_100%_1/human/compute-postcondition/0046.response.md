According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer. An integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is not zero.

State: **`n` is not zero, `k` is an integer, `m` is 1, `s` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer equal to the original value of `n` plus 1 divided by 2, `_` is any value plus 1**
