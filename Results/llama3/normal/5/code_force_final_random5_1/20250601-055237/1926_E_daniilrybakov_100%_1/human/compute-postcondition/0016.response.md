Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is any value, `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than 0 and `n` is (`n` original value)//4 and `n` original value is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer and `k` <= `n*2`, `s` is less than `k` + `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is a positive integer equal to (`n*2+1`)//4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
