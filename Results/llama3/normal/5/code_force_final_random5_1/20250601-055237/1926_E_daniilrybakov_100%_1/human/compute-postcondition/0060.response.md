Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0 and equal to a quarter of its original value which is greater than 0, k is an integer, m is 4, t is a positive integer, x is a positive integer equal to a quarter of the original value of n plus 1 divided by 2, _ is any value plus 1, s is a value equal to its original value plus the original value of x plus the new value of x. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
