Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0 and n is (n original value)//2, k is a positive integer and k <= n, s is less than k + x, m is 2, x is a positive integer equal to (n+1)//2. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s + x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
