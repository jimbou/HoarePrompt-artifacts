Output State: **_ is any value plus 1, t is a positive integer, n is greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 2, k is an integer, m is 8, x is an integer equal to the original value of n plus 1 divided by 2, s is an integer equal to the original value of x plus x plus x. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
