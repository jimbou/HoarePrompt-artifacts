According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of n needed to have been greater than 2 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **_ is any value plus 1, t is a positive integer, n is a non-zero integer greater than 0, k is an integer, m is 2, x is an integer equal to the original value of n plus 1 divided by 2, s is an integer equal to the original value of x**
