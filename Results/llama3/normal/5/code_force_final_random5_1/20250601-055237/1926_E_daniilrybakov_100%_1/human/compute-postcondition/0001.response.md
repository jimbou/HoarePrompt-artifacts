According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, the variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so it can be adjusted to be any value. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is any value, stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k, where n and k are positive integers and k <= n**
