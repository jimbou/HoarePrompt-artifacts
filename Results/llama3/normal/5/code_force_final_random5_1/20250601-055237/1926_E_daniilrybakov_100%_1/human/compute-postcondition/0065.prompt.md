Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k, where n and k are positive integers and k <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is 0, k is a positive integer and k <= n*2^m, s is less than k + x and s is equal to its original value plus x, m is a power of 2, and this is printed: (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is any value plus 1, t is a positive integer, n is 0, k is an integer, m is a power of 2, x is an integer equal to the original value of n plus 1 divided by 2, s is an integer equal to the sum of all x values from previous iterations, and the value of the expression (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m is being printed, where k is an integer, s is the sum of all x values from previous iterations, and m is a power of 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is 0, k is an integer, m is a power of 2, t is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, _ is any value plus 1, s is a value equal to the sum of the original value of x and all the values of x from the previous iterations, and the value of the expression (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
