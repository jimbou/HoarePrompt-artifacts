Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, _ is any value, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k, where n and k are positive integers and k <= n, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer and k <= n, s is 0, m is 1
Code of the loop:
while n:
    x = (n + 1) // 2
    n //= 2
    if s < k and k <= s + x:
        break
    s += x
    m *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is a positive integer and n is even, k is a positive integer and k <= n, s is less than k + x, m is 2, x is a positive integer equal to (n+1)//2. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s + x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0 and n is (n original value)//2, k is a positive integer and k <= n, s is less than k + x, m is 4, x is a positive integer equal to (n+1)//2. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s + x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0 and n is (n original value)//4 and n original value is greater than 1, k is a positive integer and k <= n*2, s is less than k + x and s is equal to its original value plus x, m is 8, x is a positive integer equal to (n*2+1)//4. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s + x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
