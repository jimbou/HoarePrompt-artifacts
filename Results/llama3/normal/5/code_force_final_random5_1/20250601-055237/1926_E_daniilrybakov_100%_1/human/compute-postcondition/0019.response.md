Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is 0, k is a positive integer and k <= n*2^m, s is less than k + x and s is equal to its original value plus x, m is a power of 2.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 0, `k` will be less than or equal to `n*2^m`, `s` will be less than `k + x` and will be equal to its original value plus `x`, and `m` will be a power of 2. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
