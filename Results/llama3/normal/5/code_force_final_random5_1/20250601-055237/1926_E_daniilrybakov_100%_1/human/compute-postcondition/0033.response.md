Postcondition: ***_ is any value plus 1, t is a positive integer, n is a non-zero integer greater than 0, k is an integer, m is 2, x is an integer equal to the original value of n plus 1 divided by 2, s is an integer equal to the original value of x. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
