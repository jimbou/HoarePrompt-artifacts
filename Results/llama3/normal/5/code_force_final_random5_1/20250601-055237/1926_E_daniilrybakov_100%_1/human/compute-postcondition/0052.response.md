According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 2. This means that the original value of `n` must have been even and greater than 2, so that `n` is still a positive integer after being divided by 2. Therefore, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `m` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to the original value of `n` divided by 2, `_` is any value plus 1, `s` is a value equal to its original value plus `x`**
