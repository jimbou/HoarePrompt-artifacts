According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0 and n is (n original value)//2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of n needed to have been greater than 1 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is a positive integer, _ is any value, n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0 and n is (n original value)//2 and n original value is greater than 1, k is a positive integer and k <= n, s is less than k + x, m is 4, x is a positive integer equal to (n+1)//2**
