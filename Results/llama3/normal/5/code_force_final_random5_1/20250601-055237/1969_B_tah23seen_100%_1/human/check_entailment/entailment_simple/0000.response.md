Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost.

The function `func_1` iterates through the input string `s` and maintains a count of the number of '1's encountered so far (`one`). Whenever it encounters a '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it increments the cost by `one + 1`. This is because a '0' following one or more '1's requires a cyclic shift of the substring starting from the first '1' to the current '0', which has a cost equal to the length of the substring.

The program returns the total cost, which is the sum of all the '1's in the string plus the number of '0's that follow one or more '1's.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the minimum cost to sort the string is achieved by performing cyclic shifts on the substrings that contain '1's followed by '0's. By counting the number of '1's and the number of '0's that follow them, the program calculates the minimum cost required to sort the string.

Correctness: **True**
