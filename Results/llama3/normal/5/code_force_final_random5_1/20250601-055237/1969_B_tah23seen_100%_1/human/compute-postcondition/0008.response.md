Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5. If the first character `i` is '1', then `one` is set to 1. If the first character `i` is '0' and the count of '1's `one` is greater than 0, then `cost` is set to `one` + 1. Otherwise, the values of `cost`, `one`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
