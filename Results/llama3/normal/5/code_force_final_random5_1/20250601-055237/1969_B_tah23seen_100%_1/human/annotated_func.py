#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: s is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and its length is at least 0 and at most 2 * 10^5, cost is the sum of all the '1's in s plus the number of '0's that follow one or more '1's, one is the number of '1's in s.
    return cost
    #The program returns the sum of all the '1's in string 's' plus the number of '0's that follow one or more '1's in string 's'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total cost of a binary string, where the cost is the sum of all '1's in the string plus the number of '0's that follow one or more '1's, and returns this total cost.
