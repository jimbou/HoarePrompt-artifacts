Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `cost` is `one` + 1, `one` is greater than 0, `i` is '0'**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been updated to be `one` + 1, where `one` is greater than 0. The values of the other variables remain the same. The string `s` still consists of only '0's and '1's, and its length is still at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5. The value of `one` is still greater than 0, and the value of `i` is still '0'.
