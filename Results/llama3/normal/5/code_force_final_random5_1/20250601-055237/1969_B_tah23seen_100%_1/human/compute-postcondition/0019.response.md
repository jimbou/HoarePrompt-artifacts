Output State: **s is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and its length is at least 0 and at most 2 * 10^5, cost is the sum of all the '1's in s plus the number of '0's that follow one or more '1's, one is the number of '1's in s.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the string `s` will be empty (since the loop iterates over each character in `s`), the variable `cost` will be the sum of all the '1's in the original string `s` plus the number of '0's that follow one or more '1's, and the variable `one` will be the total number of '1's in the original string `s`.
