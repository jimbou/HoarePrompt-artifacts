Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum total cost. The function iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered so far (`one`). Whenever it encounters a '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it increments the cost by `one + 1`. This is because a cyclic shift operation is needed to move the '1's to the left of the '0'.

However, there is a flaw in the program. The cost calculation is incorrect. The correct cost should be the minimum number of operations required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's. The current program calculates the cost as the sum of the lengths of all substrings that need to be shifted, which is not the minimum cost.

For example, consider the input string "101011". The program calculates the cost as 5 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1), but the minimum cost is actually 3 (shift the first '1' to the left, then shift the second '1' to the left, and finally shift the third '1' to the left).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
