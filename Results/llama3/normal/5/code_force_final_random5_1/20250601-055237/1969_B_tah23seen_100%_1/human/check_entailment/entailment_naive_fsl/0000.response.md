Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "101", the program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The program is not correctly calculating the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

The issue with the program is that it is not considering the case where a substring can be cyclically shifted to the left. The program is only considering the case where a substring can be cyclically shifted to the right. This is why it is not correctly calculating the minimum total cost.

For example, in the case of the input string "101", the program is not considering the possibility of cyclically shifting the substring "10" to the left, which would result in the string "01" and a cost of 1. Instead, the program is only considering the possibility of cyclically shifting the substring "10" to the right, which would result in the string "01" and a cost of 2.
