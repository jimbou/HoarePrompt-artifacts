Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The function `func_1` iterates over the string, keeping track of the number of '1's encountered so far. Whenever it encounters a '0' after one or more '1's, it increments the cost by the number of '1's plus one. This is because the '1's need to be shifted to the right of the '0's, and the cost is equal to the length of the substring being shifted. The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted, as the cost will be zero in this case.

Correctness: **True**
