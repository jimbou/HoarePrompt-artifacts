Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If a contains exactly one element, the maximum of the absolute difference between the only element in list a and the maximum element in list c, and the absolute difference between the only element in list a and the minimum element in list c has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
