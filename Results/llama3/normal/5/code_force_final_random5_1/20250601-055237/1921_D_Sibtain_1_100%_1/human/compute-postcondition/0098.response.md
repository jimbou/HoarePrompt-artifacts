The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the length of the list `a`. If `k` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range of the length of `a` plus 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1 and it must be less than the length of `a`. So `k` is within the range of the length of `a` plus 2 and it is less than the length of `a`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is within the range of the length of `a` plus 2 and it is less than the length of `a`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `i`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**
