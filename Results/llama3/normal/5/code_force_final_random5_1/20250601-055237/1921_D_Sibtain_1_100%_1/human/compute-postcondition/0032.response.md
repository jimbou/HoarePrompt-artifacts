Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, k is 2, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, ans is increased by the maximum of the previous t1 and t2, i is either 0 or 1 if t2 > t1, otherwise i is either 1 or 2, j is either 3 or 4 if t2 > t1, otherwise j is either 2 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.***
