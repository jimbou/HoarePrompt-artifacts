The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, the number of test cases is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again the number of test cases must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop which is equal to ans is being printed**
