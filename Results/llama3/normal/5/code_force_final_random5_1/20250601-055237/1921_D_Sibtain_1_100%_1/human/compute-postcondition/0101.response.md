Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is within the range of the length of `a` plus 2 and it is less than the length of `a`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i-th` element of the sorted list `a` and the `i-th` element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)-th` element of the sorted list `a` and the `(len(c) - j)-th` element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is increased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
