Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `i`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `m` remain integers, `a` and `c` remain sorted lists of integers in ascending and descending order respectively, and `_` remains 2. The loop counter `k` is now equal to the length of `a`. The variable `ans` has accumulated the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`. The variables `t1` and `t2` hold the absolute differences between the `i`-th element of `a` and the `i`-th element of `c` and the `(len(a) - j)`-th element of `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`-th element of `c` respectively. The value of `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2` in each iteration. The indices `i` and `j` are updated based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is incremented by 1, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
