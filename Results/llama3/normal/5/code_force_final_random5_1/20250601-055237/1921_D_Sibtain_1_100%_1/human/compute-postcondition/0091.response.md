Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is within the range of the length of `a`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, if the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c` is greater than the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
