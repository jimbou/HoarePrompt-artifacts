This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements in the sorted lists a and c (in reverse order), with the exception of the case where all elements in both lists are equal, in which case it prints 0. The function prints the calculated sum for each test case.
