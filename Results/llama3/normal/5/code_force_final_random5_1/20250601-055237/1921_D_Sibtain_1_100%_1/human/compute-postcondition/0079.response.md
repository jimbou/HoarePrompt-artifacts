The code prints the maximum of the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the maximum element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order, and the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the minimum element of the sorted list `c` in reverse order.
Output: **max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))) (where a[0] is the first element of the sorted list a, max(c) is the maximum element of the sorted list c in reverse order, and min(c) is the minimum element of the sorted list c in reverse order)**
