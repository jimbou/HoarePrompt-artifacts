Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 1, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, ans is increased by the maximum of t1 and t2, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of c plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs. If the lists a and c contain the same single integer, the value 0 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next line.***
