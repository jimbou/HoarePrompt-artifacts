Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `a` contains exactly one element, the maximum of the absolute difference between the only element in list `a` and the maximum element in list `c`, and the absolute difference between the only element in list `a` and the minimum element in list `c` has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of the previous `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of the previous `t1` and `t2`, `i` is either 0 or 1 if `t2` > `t1`, otherwise `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 3 or 4 if `t2` > `t1`, otherwise `j` is either 2 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
