Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with exactly one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum of the absolute difference between the only element in list `a` and the maximum element in list `c`, and the absolute difference between the only element in list `a` and the minimum element in list `c` has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged. The program has printed the maximum absolute difference between the only element in `a` and the maximum or minimum element in `c`. The program has skipped to the next iteration of the loop, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
