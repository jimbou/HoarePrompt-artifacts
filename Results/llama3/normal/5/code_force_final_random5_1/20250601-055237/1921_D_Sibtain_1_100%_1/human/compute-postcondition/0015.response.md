Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, i is 0, j is 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the first elements and the last elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c`, and assigns these values to `t1` and `t2`, respectively. The values of `t1` and `t2` are determined by the specific elements at the corresponding positions in `a` and `c`. No other variables are affected by the code.
