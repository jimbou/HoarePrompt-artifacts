Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 1, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, ans is increased by the maximum of t1 and t2, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of c plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, and the value 0 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, and the value 0 is still being printed.
