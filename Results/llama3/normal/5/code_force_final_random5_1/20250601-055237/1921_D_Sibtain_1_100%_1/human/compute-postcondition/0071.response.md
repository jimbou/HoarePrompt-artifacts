The code prints the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, where `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`.
Output: ** `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, and the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop which is equal to ans is being printed**
