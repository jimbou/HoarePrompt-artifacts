Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is within the range of the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the (i+1)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (i+1)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `k`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The value of `t1` is updated to be the absolute difference between the (i+1)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (i+1)-th element of the sorted list `c`. The value of `t2` remains the same, and it is still less than or equal to `t1`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
