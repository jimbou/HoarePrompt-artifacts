You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())

            else:
                i += 1

Return Postconditions: `_` is equal to the number of test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `i`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1, stdin is empty, and the calculated answer is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
