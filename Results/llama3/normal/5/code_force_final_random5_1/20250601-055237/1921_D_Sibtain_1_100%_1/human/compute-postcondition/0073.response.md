Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 2, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, ans is the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for each iteration of the loop, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of a plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for each iteration of the loop which is equal to ans is being printed**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Then, it reads two lists of integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `c`. The lists `a` and `c` are sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively. The variable `k` is set to the length of `a`. The variables `t1` and `t2` are set to the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`. The variable `ans` is set to the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop. The variables `i` and `j` are set to the length of `a` and the length of `a` plus 1, respectively. The input stream `stdin` now contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. The sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, which is equal to `ans`, is being printed.
