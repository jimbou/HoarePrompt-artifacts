The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 1, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs**
