Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin, each containing multiple integers. The first line assigns the values of the first two integers to `n` and `m`, respectively. The second line assigns the remaining integers from the first line to `a`, and the third line assigns the integers from the second line to `c`. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 0. After executing the code, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
