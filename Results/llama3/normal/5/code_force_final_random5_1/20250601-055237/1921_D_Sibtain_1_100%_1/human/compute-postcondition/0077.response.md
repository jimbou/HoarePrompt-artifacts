Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 2, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, ans is the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for each iteration of the loop, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of a plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If all elements in both lists a and c are the same, then 0 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for each iteration of the loop which is equal to ans is being printed.***
