The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop. 

`ans` is calculated by iterating through the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in reverse order. For each iteration, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of `a` and the i-th element of `c`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of `c`. The maximum of `t1` and `t2` is added to `ans`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `c` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of a and c)**
