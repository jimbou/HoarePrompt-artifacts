Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 3, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, k is at least 3, t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, ans is the maximum of t1, t2, and the sum of the previous maximum of t1 and t2 and the current maximum of t1 and t2, if t2 is greater than t1, then either i is 0 and j is 5 or i is 1 and j is 4, otherwise i is either 1 or 2 and j is either 2 or 4, or i is either 2 or 3 and j is either 1 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.***
