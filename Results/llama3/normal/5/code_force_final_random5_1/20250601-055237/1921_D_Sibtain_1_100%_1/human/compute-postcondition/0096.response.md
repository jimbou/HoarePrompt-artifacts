Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 2, k is within the range of the length of a plus 1, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and c at indices i and j and the absolute differences between the elements of a and c at indices len(a) - j and len(c) - j, t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If t2 > t1, then j is increased by 1. Otherwise, i is increased by 1.**
