Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If all elements of a and c are the same and equal to each other, then 0 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
