To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, so we need to adjust `k` to be within the range of the length of `a`. We also need to adjust `a` to have at least 1 element.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is within the range of the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**
