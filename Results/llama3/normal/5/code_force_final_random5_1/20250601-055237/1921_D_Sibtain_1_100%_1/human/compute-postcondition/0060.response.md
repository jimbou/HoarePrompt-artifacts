Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 2, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether `t2` is greater than `t1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is now 2 and `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is now 1 and `j` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
