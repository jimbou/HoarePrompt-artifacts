Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 1, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**
