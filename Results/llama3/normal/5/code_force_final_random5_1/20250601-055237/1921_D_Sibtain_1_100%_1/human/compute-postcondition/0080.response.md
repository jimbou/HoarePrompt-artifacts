Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 2, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, ans is the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for each iteration of the loop, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of a plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and the maximum absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the maximum element of the sorted list c or the first element of the sorted list a and the minimum element of the sorted list c is printed**
