Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 2, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, k is at least 2, t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, ans is the maximum of t1 and t2, i is 0 and j is 3 if t2 is greater than t1, otherwise i is 1 and j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.**

The code updates the values of `t1` and `t2` based on the values of `i` and `j`, which are determined by the comparison of `t2` and `t1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is also unchanged as it is not updated in the code. The stdin remains the same as it is not used in the code.
