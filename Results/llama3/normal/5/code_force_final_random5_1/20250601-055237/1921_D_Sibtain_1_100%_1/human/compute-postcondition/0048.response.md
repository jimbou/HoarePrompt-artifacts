Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs. If the length of the sorted list `a` is 1, the maximum of the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the maximum element of the sorted list `c`, and the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the minimum element of the sorted list `c` is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `i`, `j`, and `ans` are updated to 0, 1, and 0, respectively. The condition regarding the length of `a` and the printing of the maximum absolute difference is still applicable.
