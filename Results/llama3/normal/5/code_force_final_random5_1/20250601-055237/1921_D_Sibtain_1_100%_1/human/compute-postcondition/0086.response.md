Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 2, k is within the range of the length of a, i is 0, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, ans is 0. The current value of t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c. The current value of t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c. The current value of t2 is greater than the current value of t1***
