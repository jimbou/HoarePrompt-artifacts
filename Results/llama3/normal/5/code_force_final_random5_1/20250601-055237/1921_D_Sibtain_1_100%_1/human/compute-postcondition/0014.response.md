To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, if it has at least one element, the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `k` is 0**
