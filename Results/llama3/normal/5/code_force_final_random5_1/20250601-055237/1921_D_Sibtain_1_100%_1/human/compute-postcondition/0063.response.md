To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for k in range(len(a)):`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `k` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `k` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 2 and `a` has a length of at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have a length of at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 3, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 3, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the maximum of `t1`, `t2`, and the sum of the previous maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the current maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 4, otherwise `i` is either 1 or 2 and `j` is either 1 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.**
