The only variable in the loop head is variable  k and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and list a. If k is less than the length of list a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is 0 and a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time the k is 1 and a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**
