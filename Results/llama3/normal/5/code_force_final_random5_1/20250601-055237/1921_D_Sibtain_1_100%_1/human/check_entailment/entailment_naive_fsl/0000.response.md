Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from the array a_i.

The program first checks if all elements in both arrays are the same, in which case the maximum difference is 0. It then sorts the arrays a and c in ascending and descending order, respectively. If the length of array a is 1, it calculates the maximum difference by comparing the single element in a with the maximum and minimum elements in c.

For the general case, the program uses a two-pointer approach to iterate through the sorted arrays. It maintains two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning and end of the arrays, respectively. At each step, it calculates the absolute difference between the current elements in a and c, and adds the maximum of these differences to the total difference ans. The pointers are then moved accordingly to ensure that the maximum difference is always considered.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the arrays have different lengths, when all elements in one or both arrays are the same, and when the arrays have distinct elements. The use of the two-pointer approach ensures that the program has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting, and a space complexity of O(n) for storing the input arrays.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
