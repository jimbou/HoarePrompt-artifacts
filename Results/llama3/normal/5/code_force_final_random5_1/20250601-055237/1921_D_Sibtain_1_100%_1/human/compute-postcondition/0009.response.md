The code prints the maximum absolute difference between the only element in list `a` and the maximum element in list `c`, or the only element in list `a` and the minimum element in list `c`.
Output: **max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))) (where a[0] is the only element in the sorted list a, max(c) is the maximum element in the sorted list c, and min(c) is the minimum element in the sorted list c)**
