Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 2, k is within the range of the length of a plus 2 and it is less than the length of a, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and c at indices i and j and the absolute differences between the elements of a and c at indices len(a) - j and len(c) - j, t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, ans is increased by the maximum of t1 and t2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between elements of two sorted lists `a` and `c` at specific indices, and updates the variable `ans` with the sum of the maximum of these differences. The variables `t1` and `t2` are used to store the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j`, and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, respectively. The value of `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
