To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `k` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 2.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of the previous `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
