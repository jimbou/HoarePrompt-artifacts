Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The relationship between `i` and `j` based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2` is maintained. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
