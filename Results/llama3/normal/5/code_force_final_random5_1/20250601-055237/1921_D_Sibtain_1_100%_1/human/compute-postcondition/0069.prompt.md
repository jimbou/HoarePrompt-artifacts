Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs. If the length of the sorted list `a` is 1, the maximum of the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the maximum element of the sorted list `c`, and the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the minimum element of the sorted list `c` is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 1, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 2, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the maximum of `t1`, `t2`, and the sum of the previous maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the current maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 4, otherwise `i` is either 1 or 2 and `j` is either 1 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 3, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 3, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the sum of the previous maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the current maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then either `i` is 0 and `j` is 5 or `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, otherwise `i` is either 1 or 2 and `j` is either 2 or 4, or `i` is either 2 or 3 and `j` is either 1 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
