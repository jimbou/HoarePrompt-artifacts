Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, _ is 1, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, ans is increased by the maximum of t1 and t2, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of c plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to the first and second inputs, respectively. The lists `a` and `c` are updated to the lists of integers from the input. The values of `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` are updated based on the lengths and elements of `a` and `c`. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains one less input.
