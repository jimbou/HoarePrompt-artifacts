Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If the length of `a` is 1, the maximum absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the maximum element of the sorted list `c` or the first element of the sorted list `a` and the minimum element of the sorted list `c` is printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged. The variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` are reassigned to 0, 1, and 0, respectively. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. The condition for printing the maximum absolute difference and skipping the current iteration of the loop when the length of `a` is 1 remains the same.
