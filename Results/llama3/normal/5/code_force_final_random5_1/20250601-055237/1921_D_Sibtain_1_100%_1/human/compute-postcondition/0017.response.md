Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `k` is 0, the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` is `t1`, the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c` is `t2`, and the current value of `t2` is greater than the current value of `t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
