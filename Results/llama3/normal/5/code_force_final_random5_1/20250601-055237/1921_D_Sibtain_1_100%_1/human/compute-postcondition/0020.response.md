Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c. If t2 is greater than t1, then i is 0 and j is 2. Otherwise, i is 1 and j is 1.***
