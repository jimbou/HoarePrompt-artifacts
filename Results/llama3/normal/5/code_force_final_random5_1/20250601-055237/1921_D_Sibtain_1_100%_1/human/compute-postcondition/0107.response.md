Output State: **`_` is equal to the number of test cases, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `i`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1, stdin is empty, and the calculated answer is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all test cases, and the variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `_` is equal to the number of test cases, and the input lists `a` and `c` have been sorted and processed. The answer `ans` has been calculated and printed, and the input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
