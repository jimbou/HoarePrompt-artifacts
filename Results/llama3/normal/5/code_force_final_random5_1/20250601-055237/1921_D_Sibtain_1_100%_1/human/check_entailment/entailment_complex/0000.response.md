Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of list c in a way that maximizes the sum of absolute differences with the corresponding elements of list a. The program handles the edge case where all elements in both lists are equal, and it also handles the case where the length of list a is 1. The use of two pointers, i and j, to traverse the lists a and c from both ends is a clever approach to find the maximum total difference.

Correctness: **True**
