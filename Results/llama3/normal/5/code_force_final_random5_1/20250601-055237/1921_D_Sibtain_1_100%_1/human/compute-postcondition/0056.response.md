Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 1, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The values of `i` and `j` are determined based on the comparison between `t1` and `t2`. The input state remains the same with one less test case.
