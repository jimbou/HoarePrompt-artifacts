Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 2, k is within the range of the length of a, i is 0, j is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, ans is 0. The current value of t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c. The current value of t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c. The current value of t2 is greater than the current value of t1**

In this output state, the value of j has been incremented by 1, resulting in j being 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of t1 remains the same, as it depends on the value of i, which is still 0. The current value of t2 has changed, as it now depends on the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, where j is now 2. The relationship between t1 and t2 remains the same, with t2 being greater than t1.
