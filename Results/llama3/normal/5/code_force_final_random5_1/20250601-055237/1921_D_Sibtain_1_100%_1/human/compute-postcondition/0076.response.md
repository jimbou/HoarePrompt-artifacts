Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `a` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop which is equal to `ans` is being printed, and 0 is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. No variables have changed values, and the program continues to the next iteration.
