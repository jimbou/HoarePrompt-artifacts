Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, k is equal to the length of a, t1 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c, ans is increased by the maximum of t1 and t2, i is equal to the length of a, j is equal to the length of c plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.**

The code sorts the list `a` in ascending order and the list `c` in descending order. This changes the order of elements in both lists. The values of `t1` and `t2` are updated based on the new order of elements in `a` and `c`. The value of `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
