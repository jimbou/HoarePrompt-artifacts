Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 2, k is within the range of the length of a plus 1, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and c at indices i and j and the absolute differences between the elements of a and c at indices len(a) - j and len(c) - j, t1 is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list a and the i-th element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list a and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list c, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is not explicitly modified in the code, but its description is updated to reflect the calculation of the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `c` at specific indices. The new variables `t1` and `t2` are introduced, representing the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j`, and `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, respectively. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that three inputs have been consumed.
