Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t1` is greater than or equal to `t2`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the lists `a` and `c`, as well as the relationship between `t1` and `t2`, are still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
