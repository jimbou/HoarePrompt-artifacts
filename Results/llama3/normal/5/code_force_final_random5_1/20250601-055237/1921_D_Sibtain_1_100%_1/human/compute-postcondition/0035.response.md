The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the last elements of `a` and `c` and the first elements of `a` and `c`.

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the last element of `a` is the maximum element in `a` and the first element of `c` is the maximum element in `c`. Similarly, the first element of `a` is the minimum element in `a` and the last element of `c` is the minimum element in `c`.

Therefore, `t1` is the absolute difference between the maximum element of `a` and the minimum element of `c`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between the minimum element of `a` and the maximum element of `c`.

The value of `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, which is the maximum absolute difference between the maximum element of `a` and the minimum element of `c` or the minimum element of `a` and the maximum element of `c`.

Output: **the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the maximum element of a and the minimum element of c or the minimum element of a and the maximum element of c**
