Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 2, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the maximum of `t1`, `t2`, and the sum of the previous maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the current maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 4, otherwise `i` is either 1 or 2 and `j` is either 1 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, and `k` remain the same. The values of `t1` and `t2` are still the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `c`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `t1`, `t2`, and the sum of the previous maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the current maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The values of `i` and `j` are still dependent on the comparison of `t1` and `t2`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.
