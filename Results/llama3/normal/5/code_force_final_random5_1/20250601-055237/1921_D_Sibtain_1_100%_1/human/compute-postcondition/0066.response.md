Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 3, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 3, `t1` is the absolute difference between the i-th element of the sorted list `a` and the i-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)-th element of the sorted list `a` and the (len(c) - j)-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is the maximum of `t1`, `t2`, and the sum of the previous maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the current maximum of `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, otherwise `i` is either 2 or 3 and `j` is either 1 or 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, and `k` remain the same. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` becomes 1, otherwise `i` becomes either 2 or 3. The values of `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, and `j` remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.
