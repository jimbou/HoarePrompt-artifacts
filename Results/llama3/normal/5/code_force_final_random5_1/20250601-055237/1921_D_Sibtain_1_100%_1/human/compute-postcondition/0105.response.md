The code prints the calculated answer which is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, where `a` is a sorted list of integers and `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order.
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and c at indices i and j and the absolute differences between the elements of a and c at indices len(a) - j and len(c) - j)**
