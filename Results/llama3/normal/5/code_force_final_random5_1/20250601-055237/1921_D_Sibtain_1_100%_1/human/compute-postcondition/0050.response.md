Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 1, c is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, _ is 1, k is at least 1, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list a and the first element of the sorted list c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list a and the last element of the sorted list c, ans is 0, i is 0, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `_`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only changes are in the values of `t1` and `t2`, which are now the absolute differences between the first and last elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c`, respectively. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs.
