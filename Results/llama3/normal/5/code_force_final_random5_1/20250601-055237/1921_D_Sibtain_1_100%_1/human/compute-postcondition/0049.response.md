To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a`. If the length of `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the length of `a` is `k`, so we need to adjust `k` to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 1, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs**
