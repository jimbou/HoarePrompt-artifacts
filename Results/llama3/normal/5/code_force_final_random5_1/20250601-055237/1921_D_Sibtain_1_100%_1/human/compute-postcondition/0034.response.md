Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final state. The value of `k` is now equal to the length of the list `a`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `a`. The values of `t1` and `t2` are the absolute differences between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, and the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, respectively. The value of `ans` has been increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The values of `i` and `j` are now equal to the length of `a` and the length of `c` plus 1, respectively, indicating that the loop has moved through all elements in both lists. The other variables, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, and `_`, remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
