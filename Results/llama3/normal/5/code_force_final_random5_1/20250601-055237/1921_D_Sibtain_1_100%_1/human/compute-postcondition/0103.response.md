Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 2, `k` is within the range of the length of `a` plus 2 and it is less than the length of `a`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `i` and `j` and the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `i`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`-th element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `ans` has been updated to include the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, and either `i` or `j` has been incremented depending on the comparison between `t1` and `t2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
