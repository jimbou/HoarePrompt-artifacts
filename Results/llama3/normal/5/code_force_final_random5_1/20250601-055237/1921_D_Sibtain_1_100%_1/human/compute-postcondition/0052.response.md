The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 1, so the new value of `j` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of t2 is still greater than the current value of t1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of at least 1, `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `_` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of the sorted list `a` and the last element of the sorted list `c`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, and the current value of `t2` is greater than the current value of `t1`.**
