The code prints the maximum of the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the maximum element of the sorted list `c`, and the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the minimum element of the sorted list `c`.

Since `c` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `max(c)` is the first element of `c` and `min(c)` is the last element of `c`. 

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - c[k-1]), abs(a[0] - c[0])) (where a[0] is the first element of the sorted list a, c[k-1] is the last element of the sorted list c, and c[0] is the first element of the sorted list c)**
