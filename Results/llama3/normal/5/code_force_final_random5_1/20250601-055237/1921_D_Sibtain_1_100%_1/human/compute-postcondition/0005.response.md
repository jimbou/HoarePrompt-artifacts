Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with all elements being the same, `c` is a list of integers with all elements being the same, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, and 0 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop, without changing any variable values or the state of the input.
