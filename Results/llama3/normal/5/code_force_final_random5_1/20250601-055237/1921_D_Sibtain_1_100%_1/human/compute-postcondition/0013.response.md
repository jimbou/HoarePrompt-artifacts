Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `a` contains exactly one element, the maximum of the absolute difference between the only element in list `a` and the maximum element in list `c`, and the absolute difference between the only element in list `a` and the minimum element in list `c` has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged. The new variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` are introduced with values 0, 1, and 0, respectively. The state of the stdin and the condition regarding the printing of the absolute difference for list `a` with one element also remain unchanged.
