Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `_` is 0, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of the previous `t1` and `t2`, if `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of the previous `t1` and `t2` added to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
