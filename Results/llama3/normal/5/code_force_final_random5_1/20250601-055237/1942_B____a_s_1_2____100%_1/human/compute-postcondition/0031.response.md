Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum of its original value and all mex - a[i], i is -1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the variable i is now -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of the other variables, such as t, _, n, a, p, and mex, remain unchanged.
