Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum of its original value and all mex - a[i], i is n - 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases**

The code snippet modifies the values of `p[i]` and `mex`. The first line updates the value of `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]`, using the current values of `mex` and `a[i]`. The second line updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its original value and the new value of `p[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, these updates only affect the last element of the lists `a` and `p`. The other variables, including `t`, `_`, `n`, and the remaining elements of `a` and `p`, remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations are performed in the code snippet.
