Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where all values are mex - a[i], mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], i is -1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable t remains at least 1, the variable _ remains 0, and the stdin contains t - 1 test cases. The variable n remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and the variable a remains a list of n integers. The variable p is now a list of n -1 values where all values are mex - a[i], indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of the list a. The variable mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], indicating that the loop has updated mex to be the minimum value between the original mex and the values of mex - a[i] for all i. The variable i is now -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
