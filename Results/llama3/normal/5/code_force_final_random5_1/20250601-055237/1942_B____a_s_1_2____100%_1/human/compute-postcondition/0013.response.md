The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the standard input, followed by a list of `n` integers, which are stored in the list `a`. It then initializes a list `p` with `n` elements, all set to -1, and sets the variable `mex` to `n`.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, which is the value read from the standard input.
* `a` is a list of `n` integers, which are the values read from the standard input after `n`.
* `p` is a list of `n` elements, all set to -1.
* `mex` is an integer equal to `n`, which is the initial value assigned to it.

The variable `t` is not affected by the code, so its value remains at least 2. The variable `_` is also not affected, so its value remains 1. The variable `i` is not affected, so its value remains -1.

The standard input is modified by the code, as it reads `n` and the list of integers from it. After the code executes, the standard input contains `t - 2` test cases.

In summary, the code reads input from the standard input, initializes some variables, and sets up lists to store values. The output state reflects the changes made to the variables and the standard input.

Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are -1, mex is n, i is -1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases**
