The code prints the elements of the list `p`, which contains the values calculated as `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` in the list `a`. Here, `mex` is the minimum of its original value and all `mex - a[i]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `mex` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `p`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values of `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` in the list `a`.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum of its original value and all mex - a[i], and a[i] are the elements of the list a)**
