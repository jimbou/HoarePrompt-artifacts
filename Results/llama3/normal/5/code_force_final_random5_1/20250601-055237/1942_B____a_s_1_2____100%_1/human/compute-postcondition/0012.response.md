The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1, so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where all values are mex - a[i], mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], i is -1**
