Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum of its original value and all mex - a[i], i is 0, stdin contains t - 3 test cases.**

The code reads the value of `n` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to the variable `a`. The list `p` is initialized with `-1` values, and the variable `mex` is set to `n`. The value of `t` is not affected by the code, so it remains at least 1. The value of `_` is also not affected and remains 2. The variable `i` is not modified by the code and remains 0. The stdin now contains `t - 3` test cases.
