To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n -1` values all equal to -1, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n - 1`**
