Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values all equal to -1, mex is equal to n.**

The code executes the following operations: 

1. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `t` is at least 1, there are `t - 1` test cases left in stdin.

2. The second line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`.

3. The third line creates a list `p` of `n` values, all initialized to -1.

4. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to `mex`.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows: `t` remains at least 1, `_` remains 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` values all equal to -1, and `mex` is equal to `n`.
