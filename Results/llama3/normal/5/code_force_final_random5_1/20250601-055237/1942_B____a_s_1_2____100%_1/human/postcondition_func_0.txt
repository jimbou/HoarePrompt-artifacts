The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then calculates a new list of values p, where each value at index i is the minimum of the original value and the difference between the current minimum and the corresponding value in the input list. Finally, it prints the list of values p for each test case.
