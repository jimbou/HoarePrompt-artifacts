Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input: it reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. The program initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` values and the `mex` variable with `n`. This is correct because the `mex` variable is supposed to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation, and initially, all integers from `0` to `n-1` are non-negative integers that do not appear in the permutation.

3. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` in the permutation as `mex - a[i]`. This is correct because the problem statement defines `a[i]` as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, so `p_i` is `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

4. After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates the `mex` variable to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This is correct because `mex` is supposed to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation, and `p[i]` is a new element that has been added to the permutation.

5. Finally, the program prints the permutation `p`. This is correct because the problem statement asks to print any valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
