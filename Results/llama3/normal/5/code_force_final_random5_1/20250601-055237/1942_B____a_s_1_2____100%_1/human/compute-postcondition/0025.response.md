To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1.

The loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is mex - `a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum of its original value and all mex - `a[i]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases**
