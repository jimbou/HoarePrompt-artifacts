The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is n - 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is n - 2 and for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than -1. This means that `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last value is mex - a[i] and the rest are -1, mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], i is n - 2**
