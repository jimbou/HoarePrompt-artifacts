Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses the fact that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, where `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an array `p` of size `n` with all elements set to `-1`. This array will store the constructed permutation.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which will keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
5. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`). For each element `a_i`, it calculates the corresponding element `p_i` in the permutation using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`.
6. After calculating `p_i`, it updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
7. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct because it uses the given formula to calculate each element of the permutation, and it updates the `mex` value accordingly. The use of the `min` function to update `mex` ensures that it always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
