Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It successfully constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program initializes an array `p` of size `n` with all elements set to `-1`. This is done to represent the permutation `p` that needs to be constructed.

2. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`). For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` in the permutation `p` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p` constructed so far.

3. The program updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p` constructed so far.

4. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct because it iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, which allows it to construct the permutation `p` in a way that satisfies the given array `a`. The use of the `mex` variable to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p` constructed so far is also correct.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
