Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last three values are mex - a[i], mex - a[i], and mex - a[i], mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], i is n - 3**

The code modifies the value of `p[i]` by assigning it the value of `mex - a[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, this means the third last value in the list `p` is updated. The value of `mex` is then updated to be the minimum between its current value and the new value of `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[i]`. This means `mex` will be the minimum of its original value and the difference between its original value and the value of `a[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
