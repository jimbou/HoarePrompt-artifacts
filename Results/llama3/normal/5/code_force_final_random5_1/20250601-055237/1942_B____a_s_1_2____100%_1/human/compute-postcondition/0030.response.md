Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum of its original value and all mex - a[i], i is n - 3, stdin contains t - 3 test cases**

The code modifies the value of `p[i]` and `mex`. The first line assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`. The second line updates `mex` to be the minimum of its original value and the new value of `p[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, this means that the code only modifies the value of `p` at index `n - 3` and updates `mex` accordingly. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
