Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last value is mex - a[i] and the rest are -1, mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], i is n - 1**

The code modifies the values of `p`, `mex`, and does not change the values of `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, and `i`. The first line assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to the last element of `p`. The second line updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[i]`.
