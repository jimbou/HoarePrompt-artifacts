The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - 3` and `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is mex - `a[i]` and all other values are -1, `mex` is the minimum of its original value and mex - `a[i]`, `i` is `n - 3`, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases**
