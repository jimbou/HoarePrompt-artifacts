Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input: It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the list of integers `a`.
2.  The program correctly initializes the permutation `p` and the minimum non-negative integer `mex`: It initializes `p` as a list of `-1`s and `mex` as `n`, which is the maximum possible value for `mex`.
3.  The program correctly calculates the permutation `p`: It iterates over the list `a` in reverse order, calculates the value of `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, and updates `mex` as the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This is correct because `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p` up to index `i`, and `a[i]` is the difference between `mex` and `p[i]`.
4.  The program correctly prints the permutation `p`: It prints the list of values `p` for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given list `a`, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
