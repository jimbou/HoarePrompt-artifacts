To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 3`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of other variables, such as `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `a`, `p`, and `mex`, are not affected by the loop head and remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n -1` values where the last two values are `mex - a[i]` and the rest are -1, `mex` is the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - a[i]`, `i` is `n - 3`**
