Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last two values are mex - a[i] and the rest are -1, mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], i is n - 2**

The code modifies the list `p` and the variable `mex`. The first line assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`, where `i` is `n - 2`. This means the last two values of `p` are now `mex - a[i]`. The second line updates `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[i]`. This means `mex` is now the minimum value between its original value and the difference between its original value and `a[i]`. No other variables are affected.
