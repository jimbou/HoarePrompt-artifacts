Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum of its original value and all mex - a[i], i is n - 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases**

The code snippet modifies the values of `p[i]` and `mex`. The first line assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`, effectively updating the value at index `i` in the list `p`. The second line updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its original value and the newly assigned value of `p[i]`. This means that `mex` will be updated to be the smallest value between its original value and the difference between `mex` and `a[i]`.

Since `i` is `n - 2`, the code only updates the value of `p` at index `n - 2` and updates the value of `mex` accordingly. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and the remaining elements of `p` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` also remains unchanged.

In summary, the code updates the value of `p` at index `n - 2` to be `mex - a[i]` and updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its original value and the newly assigned value of `p[i]`.
