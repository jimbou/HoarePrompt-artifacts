According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `i`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and `i` is -1, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 1 and `i` is `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` values where all values are -1, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases**
