Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p based on the given array a. The program iterates over the array a in reverse order and calculates the value of p[i] as mex - a[i], where mex is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array p up to index i. The program then updates the value of mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p[i]. This ensures that the constructed permutation p satisfies the condition a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the input array a contains negative values or when the length of the array a is 1.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
