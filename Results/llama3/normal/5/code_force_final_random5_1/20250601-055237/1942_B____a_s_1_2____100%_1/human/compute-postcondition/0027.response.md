The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is n - 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be n - 2.
State: **t is at least 1, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where the value at index i is mex - a[i], mex is the minimum of its original value and all mex - a[i], i is n - 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases**
