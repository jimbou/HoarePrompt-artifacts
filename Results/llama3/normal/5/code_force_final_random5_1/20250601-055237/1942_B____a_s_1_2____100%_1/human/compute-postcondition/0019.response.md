Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is at least 2, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where the value at index i is mex - a[i] and all other values are -1, mex is the minimum of its original value and mex - a[i], i is n - 3, stdin contains t - 2 test cases**

The code snippet modifies the value of `p` at index `i` to be `mex - a[i]`, and then updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its original value and the new value of `p[i]`. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, which means that the modification to `p` and `mex` only affects the element at index `n - 3`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and the remaining elements of `p` are not affected. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains unchanged.
