To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head according to the loop statement. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order. Therefore, `i` should be `n - 2`.

The other variables in the loop head are `n`, which is not changed by the loop iteration.

The state of other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `p`, `mex`, and `stdin`) is not affected by the loop head, so they remain the same.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex` - `a[i]` and all other values are -1, `mex` is the minimum of its original value and `mex` - `a[i]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases**
