Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is at least 1, a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where the value at index i is mex - a[i] and all other values are -1, mex is the minimum of its original value and mex - a[i], i is n - 1, stdin contains t - 2 test cases**

The code modifies the values of `p`, `mex`, and does not affect the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `stdin`. The first line assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`, modifying the value of `p` at index `i`. The second line updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its original value and the new value of `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[i]`.
