The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).**
