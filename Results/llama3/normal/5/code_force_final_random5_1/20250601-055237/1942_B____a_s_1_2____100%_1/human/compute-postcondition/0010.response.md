The code prints the elements of the list `p`. The list `p` contains `n - 1` values, where each value is the difference between `mex` and `a[i]`. Since `mex` is the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - a[i]`, it means that `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between its current value and each element `a[i]` in the list `a`.

Since `i` is `-1`, it means that the list `p` contains the differences between `mex` and each element `a[i]` for all indices `i` in the list `a`, except for the last index.

Therefore, the output will be the list of differences between `mex` and each element `a[i]` for all indices `i` in the list `a`, except for the last index.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-2]] (where mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i] for all i in the list a)**
