Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the elements of the list `p`. The list `p` is defined as a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - a[i]`. Here, `mex` is the minimum of its original value and all `mex - a[i]`.

Since `mex` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe its value using the given information. `mex` is the minimum of its original value and all `mex - a[i]`, which means it is the smallest value that is not present in the list `a`.

The list `a` contains `n` integers, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The exact values of the integers in `a` are not provided, so we can't determine the exact value of `mex`.

The print statement will print the elements of the list `p`, which are the differences between `mex` and each element in the list `a`. Since we can't determine the exact value of `mex`, we can't determine the exact values of the elements in `p`.

However, we can describe the output as the list of differences between the minimum value not present in the list `a` and each element in the list `a`.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum value not present in the list a)**
