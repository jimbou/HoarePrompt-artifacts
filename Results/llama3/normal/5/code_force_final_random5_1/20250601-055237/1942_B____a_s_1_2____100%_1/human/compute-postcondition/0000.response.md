Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-n <= a_i <= n).
