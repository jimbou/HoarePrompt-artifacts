Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least two unique characters, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the first character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is the character that is `len(b) - 0 - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and the key is the second character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet**

In this output state, the value of `char_map` has been updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is the second character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet. The values of the other variables remain the same.
