Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least three unique characters, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is the first character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is the character that is `len(b) - 0 - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, the key is the second character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is the character that is `len(b) - 1 - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and the key is the third character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is the character that is `len(b) - 2 - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and the value of the third key-value pair is updated to the character that is `len(b) - 2 - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.**

In this output state, the value of `char_map[c]` is updated to the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, which is equivalent to `len(b) - 2 - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, since `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
