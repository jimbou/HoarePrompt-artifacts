Reasoning: 

The provided program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string `s`. It first creates a character map by iterating over the sorted set of unique characters in `b` and mapping each character to its symmetric character. Then, it iterates over the characters in `b` and replaces each character with its corresponding character in the map.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string contains duplicate characters, as it only considers unique characters when creating the character map. It also correctly handles the case where the input string contains characters that are not in the alphabet, as it only considers lowercase Latin letters.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the example inputs and outputs demonstrate that the program produces the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
