Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least n unique characters, `i` is n-1, `c` is the nth character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `s` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the variable `s` has been assigned an empty string, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `b` still contains at least n unique characters, `i` is still n-1, `c` is still the nth character in the sorted set of `b`, and `char_map` still contains n key-value pairs with the same properties as before.
