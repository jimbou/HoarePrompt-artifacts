Output State: **b is a string of lowercase Latin letters, char_map is an empty dictionary.**

The code defines a function to decode a given string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. The function takes `b` as an argument and returns the decoded string `s`. The function also initializes an empty dictionary `char_map`. The initial state of `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and the code does not modify it. The `char_map` dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary and remains unchanged throughout the code execution.
