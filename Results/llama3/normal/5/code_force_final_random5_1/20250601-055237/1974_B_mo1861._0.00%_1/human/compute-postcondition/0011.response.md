To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for c in b:`. The objects involved are `c` and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`, which means we have already processed `n-1` characters in the string `b`. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next character in the string `b`.

Since `c` is the first character in the string `b` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to move to the next character in the string `b` for the next iteration. Therefore, `c` should be the second character in the string `b`.

The string `b` has at least `n` unique characters and at least 1 character, so it must have at least 2 characters. Therefore, `b` still has at least `n` unique characters and at least 2 characters.

The dictionary `char_map` has `n` key-value pairs, where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet. Since `i` is `n-1`, `len(b) - i - 1` is 0, which means the value for each key in `char_map` is 'a'. This does not change for the next iteration.

The string `s` contains the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet. Since `i` is `n-1`, `len(b) - i - 1` is 0, which means `s` contains 'a'. This does not change for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least `n` unique characters and at least 2 characters, `i` is `n`, `c` is the second character in the string `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is 'a', `s` is a string that contains 'a'**
