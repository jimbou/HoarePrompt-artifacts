To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `c`, and the set of `b` after sorting.

Since `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, we can assume it has at least one character. The `sorted(set(b))` expression will remove duplicates and sort the characters in ascending order.

For the loop to execute, the set of `b` must have at least one unique character. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `b` to have at least one unique character.

The variable `i` will take on the index of each character in the sorted set, starting from 0. So, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 0.

The variable `c` will take on the value of each character in the sorted set. Since `b` has at least one unique character, we can adjust the state of `c` to be the first character in the sorted set.

The state of `char_map` is not affected by the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `i` is 0, `c` is the first character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is an empty dictionary**
