Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. The decoding process involves creating a character mapping `char_map` where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character that is determined by its position in the sorted set.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It first creates a character mapping `char_map` where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet. Then, it uses this mapping to replace each character in the string `b` with its corresponding decoded character.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The function `func_1` correctly decodes the input string `b` and returns the original string `s`.

Correctness: **True**
