Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least n unique characters, `i` is n-1, `c` is the nth character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `s` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for c in b:
    s += char_map[c]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least n unique characters and at least 1 character, `i` is n-1, `c` is the first character in the string `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `s` is a string that contains the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least `n` unique characters and at least 2 characters, `i` is `n`, `c` is the second character in the string `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is 'a', `s` is a string that contains 'a' and 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least `n` unique characters and at least 3 characters, `i` is `n`, `c` is the third character in the string `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is 'a', `s` is a string that contains 'a', 'a', and 'a'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
