Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The `func_1` function takes the encoded string `b` as input and creates a character map `char_map` that maps each unique character in `b` to its corresponding decoded character. The mapping is done by iterating over the sorted set of characters in `b` and assigning each character to its symmetric character in the alphabet (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second-to-last, and so on).

2. The function then iterates over the encoded string `b` and uses the `char_map` to replace each character with its decoded counterpart. The decoded characters are appended to the string `s`, which is returned as the decoded string.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters: The `char_map` is created using the sorted set of characters in `b`, which ensures that each character is mapped to its correct decoded character, even if it appears multiple times in the input string.
* Strings with characters that are not in the alphabet: The program does not attempt to decode characters that are not in the alphabet, which is correct according to the problem statement.
* Empty strings: The program correctly handles empty strings by returning an empty string.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all possible inputs correctly.
