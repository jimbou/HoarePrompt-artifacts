This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a decoded string where each unique character in the input string is replaced by a character that is determined by its position in the sorted set of unique characters. The replacement character is 'a' plus the difference between the length of the input string and the position of the character in the sorted set. The function effectively maps each unique character in the input string to a specific character in the alphabet, based on the length of the input string and the number of unique characters it contains.
