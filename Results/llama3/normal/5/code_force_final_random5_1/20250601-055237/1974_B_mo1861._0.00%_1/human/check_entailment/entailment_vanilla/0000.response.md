Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to decode a given string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. The decoding process involves replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.

2. The provided program defines a function `func_1(b)` that takes the encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string `s`.

3. Inside `func_1(b)`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to store the mapping between each character in `b` and its corresponding symmetric character in `r`. The dictionary is populated by iterating over the sorted set of characters in `b` and assigning each character its symmetric character based on its position in the sorted set.

4. After creating the `char_map`, the program iterates over each character `c` in `b` and appends its corresponding symmetric character from `char_map` to the decoded string `s`.

5. Finally, the program returns the decoded string `s`.

6. The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself. It then calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string and prints the result.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
