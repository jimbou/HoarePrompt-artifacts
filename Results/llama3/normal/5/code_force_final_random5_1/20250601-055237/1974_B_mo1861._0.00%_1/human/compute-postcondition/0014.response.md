Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least `n` unique characters and at least 3 characters, `i` is `n`, `c` is the third character in the string `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is 'a', `s` is a string that contains 'a', 'a', and 'a'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending the value of `char_map[c]`, which is 'a', to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
