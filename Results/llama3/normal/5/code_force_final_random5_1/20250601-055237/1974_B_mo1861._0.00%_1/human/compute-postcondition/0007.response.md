Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least n unique characters, `i` is n-1, `c` is the nth character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the string `b` has at least n unique characters, the index `i` is n-1, the character `c` is the nth character in the sorted set of `b`, and the dictionary `char_map` has n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in the sorted set of `b` and its corresponding value is the character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.
