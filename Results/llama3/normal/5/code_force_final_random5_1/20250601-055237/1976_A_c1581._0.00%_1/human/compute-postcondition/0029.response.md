Postcondition: **The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits with at least 2 characters. If the second character is a digit, the last digit index is updated to 1, and the digits and letters lists remain unchanged. If the second character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
