Postcondition: ***The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits with at least 3 characters. If the third character is a digit, the last digit index is updated to i. If the third character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
