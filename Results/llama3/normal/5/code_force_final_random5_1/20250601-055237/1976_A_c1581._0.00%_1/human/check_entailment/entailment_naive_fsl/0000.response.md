Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if there are no digits after letters, if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, and if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program uses two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to separate the password into digits and letters. It then checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing them with their sorted versions. It also checks if there are any digits after letters by iterating through the password and checking if a digit appears after a letter.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with a mix of letters and digits. It also correctly handles cases where the password does not meet the conditions, such as a password with a digit after a letter, or a password with unsorted digits or letters.

Overall, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.
