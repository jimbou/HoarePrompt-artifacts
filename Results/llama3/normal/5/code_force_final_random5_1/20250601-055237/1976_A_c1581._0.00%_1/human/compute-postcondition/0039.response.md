Postcondition: **The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the last character in the password is a digit, the last digit index is updated to the index of the last digit in the password. If the last character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. The digits in the password are in ascending order. The letters in the password are not in sorted order.**
