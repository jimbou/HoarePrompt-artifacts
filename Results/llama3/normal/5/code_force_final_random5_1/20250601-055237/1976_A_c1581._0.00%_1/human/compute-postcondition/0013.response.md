Output State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, char is the third character in the password. If char is a digit, digits is a list containing the first two characters of the password, and letters is a list containing the second character and the third character of the password. If char is a letter, digits is a list containing only the first character of the password, and letters is a list containing the second and third character of the password.**

In natural language, the output state is: The password remains the same, and the value of char is still the third character in the password. However, the list of letters has been updated to include the third character of the password, which is char. If char is a digit, the list of digits still contains the first two characters of the password, and the list of letters now contains the second character and the third character (which is a digit). If char is a letter, the list of digits still contains only the first character of the password, and the list of letters now contains the second and third character (both of which are letters).
