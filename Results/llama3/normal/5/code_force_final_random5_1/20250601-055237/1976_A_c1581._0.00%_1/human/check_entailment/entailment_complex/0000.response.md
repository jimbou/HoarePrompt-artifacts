Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly checks if a given password meets the conditions specified in the problem description. It first separates the digits and letters in the password, then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter. If so, it returns 'NO'. 

Next, it checks if the digits and letters in the password are in ascending order. If not, it returns 'NO'. 

If the password passes all these checks, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program handles all possible cases correctly and does not contain any logical errors. 

Correctness: **True**
