You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, char is the last character in the password. If char is a digit, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, and letters is a list containing all the letters in the password. If char is a letter, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, and letters is a list containing all the letters in the password.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the last character in the password is a digit, the last digit index is updated to the index of the last digit in the password. If the last character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the last character in the password is a digit, the last digit index is updated to the index of the last digit in the password. If the last character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. The digits in the password are in ascending order.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: *The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The digits in the password are in ascending order. The letters in the password are in ascending order. If the last character in the password is a digit, the last digit index is updated to the index of the last digit in the password. If the last character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the last character in the password is a digit, the last digit index is updated to the index of the last digit in the password. If the last character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

Case_2: The program returns the string 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns the string 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'YES'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
