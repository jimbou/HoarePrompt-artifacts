To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `char` and `password`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `password` has at least one more character. At the end of the previous iteration, `password` has at least 1 character, and `char` is the first character in the password.

For the loop to execute again, `password` must have at least 2 characters, and `char` must be the second character in the password.

If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the password, and `letters` is an empty list. For the loop to execute again, `digits` must be a list containing the first two characters of the password if the second character is a digit, or `digits` is a list containing only the first character of the password if the second character is a letter. Similarly, `letters` must be an empty list if the second character is a digit, or `letters` is a list containing the second character of the password if the second character is a letter.

State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, char is the second character in the password. If char is a digit, digits is a list containing the first two characters of the password if the second character is a digit, or digits is a list containing only the first character of the password if the second character is a letter, and letters is an empty list if the second character is a digit, or letters is a list containing the second character of the password if the second character is a letter.**
