Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, char is the last character in the password. If char is a digit, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, and letters is a list containing all the letters in the password. If char is a letter, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, and letters is a list containing all the letters in the password. last_digit_index is -1
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(password):
    if char.isdigit():
        last_digit_index = i
    elif last_digit_index != -1:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, char is the first character in the password, index is 0, last_digit_index is 0 if char is a digit, otherwise last_digit_index is -1, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, letters is a list containing all the letters in the password

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits with at least 2 characters. If the second character is a digit, the last digit index is updated to 1, and the digits and letters lists remain unchanged. If the second character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits with at least 3 characters. If the third character is a digit, the last digit index is updated to i. If the third character is not a digit and the last digit index is not -1, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
