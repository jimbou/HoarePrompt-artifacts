Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is an empty list, letters is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for char in password:
    if char.isdigit():
        digits.append(char)
    else:
        letters.append(char)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, char is the first character in the password. If char is a digit, digits is a list containing the first character of the password and letters is an empty list. If char is not a digit, it is a lowercase Latin letter, digits is an empty list and letters is a list containing the first character of the password.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, char is the second character in the password. If char is a digit, digits is a list containing the first two characters of the password, and letters is an empty list. If char is a letter, digits is a list containing only the first character of the password, and letters is a list containing the second character of the password.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, char is the third character in the password. If char is a digit, digits is a list containing the first two characters of the password and the third character of the password, and letters is a list containing the second character of the password. If char is a letter, digits is a list containing the first character of the password, and letters is a list containing the second and third character of the password.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
