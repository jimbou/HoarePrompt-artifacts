Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to verify if a given password is strong based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program correctly checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if there are no digits after letters, if all digits are in non-decreasing order, and if all letters are in non-decreasing order.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly separates the password into digits and letters using the `isdigit()` method.
2.  It checks if there are any digits after letters by iterating through the password and updating the `last_digit_index` variable. If a letter is found after a digit, the program returns 'NO'.
3.  The program checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version. If they are not equal, the program returns 'NO'.
4.  Similarly, the program checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version. If they are not equal, the program returns 'NO'.
5.  If all conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'.

Based on the provided execution states and the problem description, the program correctly implements the required logic to verify strong passwords.

Correctness: **True**
