Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the length of each password, and the password itself.
2.  It defines a function `func_1(password)` that checks if a given password meets the specified conditions.
3.  Inside the function, it separates the password into digits and letters using lists.
4.  It checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and keeping track of the last digit index. If it finds a letter after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.
5.  It checks if the digits are in ascending order by comparing the list of digits with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.
6.  It checks if the letters are in ascending order by comparing the list of letters with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.
7.  If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
