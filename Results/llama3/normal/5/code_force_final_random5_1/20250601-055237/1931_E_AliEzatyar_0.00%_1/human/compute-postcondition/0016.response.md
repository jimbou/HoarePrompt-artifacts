Output State: **The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the integer 'num', which is either 0 or equal to the number of trailing zeros in 'num'.**

In this output state, the program returns the value of the variable 'counter', which is either 0 or equal to the number of trailing zeros in the integer 'num'. Since 'num' is an integer greater than 0 and between 1 and 10^4, the number of trailing zeros in 'num' can be any value between 0 and 4. Therefore, the program returns either 0 or a value between 1 and 4, representing the number of trailing zeros in 'num'.
