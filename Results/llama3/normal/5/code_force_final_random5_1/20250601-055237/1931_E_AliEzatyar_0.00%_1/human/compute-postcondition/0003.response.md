Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `counter` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and the current value of `num[i]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `counter` being equal to 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged, with `num` still being an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, and `i` still being equal to the last index of `num`. Additionally, the current value of `num[i]` is still '0'.
