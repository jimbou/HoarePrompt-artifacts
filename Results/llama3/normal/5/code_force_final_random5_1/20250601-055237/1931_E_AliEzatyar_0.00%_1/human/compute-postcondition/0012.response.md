Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `counter` is either 1 or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `num` and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` can be either 2 or 3. If `num[i]` is not '0', then `counter` can be either 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
