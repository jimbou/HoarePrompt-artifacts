Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `i` is -1, `counter` is either 0 or equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `num` remains unchanged, `i` has reached -1 (indicating the loop has finished), and `counter` has counted the number of trailing zeros in `num`. If `num` has no trailing zeros, `counter` remains 0.
