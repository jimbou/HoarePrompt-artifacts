Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and the last digit of `num` is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the last digit of `num` is still not '0'.
