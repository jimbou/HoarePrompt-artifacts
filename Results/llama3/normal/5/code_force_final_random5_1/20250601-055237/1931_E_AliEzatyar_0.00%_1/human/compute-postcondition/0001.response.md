The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and `counter` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `num` is greater than 0 and `i` is now `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1**
