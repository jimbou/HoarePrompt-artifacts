Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `counter` is either 1 or 2**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as `len(num) - 2`. However, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2.
