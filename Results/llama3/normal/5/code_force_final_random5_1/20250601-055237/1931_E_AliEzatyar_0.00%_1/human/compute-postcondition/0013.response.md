Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `counter` is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `counter` depends on the value of `num[i]`. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `counter` is either 0 or 1. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue outside of the current loop or if statement.
