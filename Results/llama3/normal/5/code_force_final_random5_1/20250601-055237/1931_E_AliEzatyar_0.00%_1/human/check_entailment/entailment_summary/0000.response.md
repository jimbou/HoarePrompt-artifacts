Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list, identifies the trailing zeros in each number, and simulates Anna's moves by subtracting the trailing zeros from the total digits. The program then compares the result with the given parameter 'm' to determine the winner. The execution summary also confirms that the function 'func_1' correctly counts the trailing zeros in a given integer.

Correctness: **True**
