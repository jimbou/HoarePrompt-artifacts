The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`num` is an integer (1 <= num <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `counter` is either 0 or 1**
