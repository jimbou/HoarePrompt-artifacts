Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the input array.
2. It correctly identifies the numbers with trailing zeros and stores them in the `zeros` list.
3. It sorts the `zeros` list in descending order, which is necessary to maximize the number of digits removed by Anna's moves.
4. It correctly calculates the number of digits that will be removed by Anna's moves by summing up the trailing zeros of every other number in the sorted `zeros` list.
5. It correctly compares the remaining number of digits with the target value `m + 1` to determine the winner.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the game's rules. The use of the `func_1` function to count trailing zeros is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
