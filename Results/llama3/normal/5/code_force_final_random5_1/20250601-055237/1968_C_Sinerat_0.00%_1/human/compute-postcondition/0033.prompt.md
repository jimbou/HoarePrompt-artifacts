Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and then n-1 space-separated integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500). The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, i is n-1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n-1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and the list a is being printed, where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of x

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of `x` starting from the first element, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and the list `a` is being printed, where the first element of `a` is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of `x` starting from the first element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n` - 1, `x` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and the list `a` is printed, where the first element of `a` is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
