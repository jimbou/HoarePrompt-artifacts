Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is 500 + x[0], stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, this means that `a[1]` is now equal to `a[0] + x[0]`, which is 500 + x[0]. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
