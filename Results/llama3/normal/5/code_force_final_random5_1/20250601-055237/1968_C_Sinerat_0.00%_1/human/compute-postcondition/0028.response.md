The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is 500 + x[0] and the third element is 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[1], stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**
