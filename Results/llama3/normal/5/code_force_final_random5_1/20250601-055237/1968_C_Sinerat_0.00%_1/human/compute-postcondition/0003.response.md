The value of `a[i]` is assigned the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. The value of `a[i - 1]` is 500 since `i` is 1 and the first element of `a` is 500. The value of `x[i - 1]` is the first element of `x` since `i` is 1. Therefore, the value of `a[i]` is 500 plus the first element of `x`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is 500 plus the first element of `x` and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**
