Reasoning:

The program is correct because it satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. 

1.  The program generates a list of integers `a` such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. This is ensured by initializing `a[0]` to 500 and then calculating the rest of the elements as the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of the input list `x`. Since the maximum value of `x_i` is 500, the maximum value of `a_i` will be `500 + 500 * (n - 1)`, which is less than `10^9` for the given constraints on `n`.

2.  The program ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. This is achieved by calculating `a[i]` as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. This implies that `a[i] mod a[i - 1] = x[i - 1]`, which satisfies the required condition.

Therefore, the program correctly generates a list of integers `a` that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
