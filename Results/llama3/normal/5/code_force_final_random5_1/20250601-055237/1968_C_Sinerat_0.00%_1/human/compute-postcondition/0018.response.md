Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, the fourth element is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the fourth element, which is the sum of the first three elements and `x[2]`. The value of `i` has been incremented to 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
