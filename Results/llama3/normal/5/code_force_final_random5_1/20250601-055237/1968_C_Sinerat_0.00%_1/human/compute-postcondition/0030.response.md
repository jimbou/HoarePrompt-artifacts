Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n` - 1, `x` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that `n` is at least 4, `i` is equal to `n` - 1, `x` remains unchanged as a list of integers equal to the input list, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`. Additionally, the stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
