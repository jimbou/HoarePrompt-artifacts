Output State: **n is an integer, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are not defined, i is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was input from stdin. The list `x` contains a list of integers that were also input from stdin. The list `a` has `n` elements, with the first element being 500, but the rest of the elements are not defined because the code only initializes the first element. The variable `i` is not defined because it was previously set to `n`, but `n` has been reassigned to a new value. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, because two inputs were consumed by the code.
