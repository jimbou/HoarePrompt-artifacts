Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is 500 + x[0] and the third element is 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[1] and the fourth element is 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[1] + x[2], stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, which means the fourth element of list `a` is now equal to the third element of list `a` plus the second element of list `x`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
