Output: **`n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of `x` starting from the first element, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and the list `a` is being printed, where the first element of `a` is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of `x` starting from the first element.**
