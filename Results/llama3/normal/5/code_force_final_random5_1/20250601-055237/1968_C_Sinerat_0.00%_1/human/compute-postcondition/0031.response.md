The code prints the elements of the list `a`, which contains `n` integers. The first element of `a` is 500, and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`. Since `x` is a list of integers equal to the input list, the elements of `a` will be the cumulative sum of 500 and the input integers.

Output: **500, (500 + x[0]), (500 + x[0] + x[1]), ..., (500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]) (where x[i] is the ith element of the input list)**
