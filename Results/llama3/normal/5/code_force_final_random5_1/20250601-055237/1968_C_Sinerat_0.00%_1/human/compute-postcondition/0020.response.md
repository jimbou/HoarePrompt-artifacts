The code prints the elements of the list `a` which contains `n` integers. The first element of `a` is 500, and the rest are the cumulative sum of `x` starting from the first element.

Since `n` is an integer and `x` is a list of integers, the cumulative sum of `x` will be a list of integers where each element is the sum of all elements in `x` up to that index.

For example, if `x` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the cumulative sum of `x` will be [1, 3, 6, 10, 15].

So, the list `a` will be [500, 501, 503, 506, 510, 515] if `x` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and `n` is 6.

Output: **[500, cumulative sum of x starting from the first element]**
