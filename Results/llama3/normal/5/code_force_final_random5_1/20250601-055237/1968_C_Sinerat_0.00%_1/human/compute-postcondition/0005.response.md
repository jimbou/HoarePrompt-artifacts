Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 500, the second element is 500 plus the first element of `x`, the third element is 500 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x`, and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, this means that the third element of `a` has been updated to be the sum of the second element of `a` (which is 500 plus the first element of `x`) and the second element of `x`. The rest of the elements in `a` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` are not affected by the code. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
