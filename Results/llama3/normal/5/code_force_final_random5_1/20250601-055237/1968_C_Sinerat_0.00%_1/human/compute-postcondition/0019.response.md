Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of `x` starting from the first element, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged, the list `x` also remains unchanged, the list `a` now contains the cumulative sum of the elements in `x`, starting from the first element, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`. The state of the input stream (`stdin`) remains the same as it was not affected by the loop.
