Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is 500 + x[0] and the third element is 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[1], stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still 2, `x` is still a list of integers equal to the input list, but the third element of `a` has been updated to be the sum of the first three elements of `x` plus 500, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
