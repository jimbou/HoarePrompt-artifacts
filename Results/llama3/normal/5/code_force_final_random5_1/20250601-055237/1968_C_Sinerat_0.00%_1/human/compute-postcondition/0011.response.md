The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n-1`, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be `n`, and `n` must be greater than `n`, which means there must be at least one more test case.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current value, `i` is `n`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and the list `a` is being printed, where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`**
