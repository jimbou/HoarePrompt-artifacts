Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`.
* The program initializes the first element of the output list `a` to 500, which satisfies the condition `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
* The program then iterates over the input list `x` and calculates the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
* The program prints the generated list `a`, which satisfies the conditions of the problem.

The key insight here is that the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x` ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. This is because the cumulative sum is always greater than or equal to the previous element, which ensures that the remainder of the division of `a_i` by `a_{i-1}` is equal to `x_i`.

Therefore, the program correctly generates a list `a` that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
