Output: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n` - 1, `x` is a list of integers equal to the input list, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and the list `a` is printed, where the first element of `a` is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`.**
