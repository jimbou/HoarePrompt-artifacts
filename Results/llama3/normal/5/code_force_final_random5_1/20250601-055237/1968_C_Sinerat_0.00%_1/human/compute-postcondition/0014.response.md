The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding the value of `x[i - 1]` to the value of `a[i - 1]`. 

Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]` which is 500, and `x[i - 1]` is `x[0]`. 

So, `a[1]` is assigned the value `500 + x[0]`. 

The values of the other variables are not affected. 

The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is `500 + x[0]`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**
