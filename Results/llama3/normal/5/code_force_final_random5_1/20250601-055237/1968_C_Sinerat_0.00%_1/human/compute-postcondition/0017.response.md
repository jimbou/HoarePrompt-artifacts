To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `x` and `a` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

The state of `stdin` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, and the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**
