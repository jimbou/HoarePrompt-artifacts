To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is `500 + x[0]`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**
