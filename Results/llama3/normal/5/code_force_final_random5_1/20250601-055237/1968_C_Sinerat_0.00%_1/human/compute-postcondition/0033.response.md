Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and the list `a` is being printed, where the first element of `a` is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the final state is that `n` is a positive integer, `i` has reached its maximum value `n`, `x` is still a list of integers, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` inputs, and the list `a` is being printed, showing the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`.
