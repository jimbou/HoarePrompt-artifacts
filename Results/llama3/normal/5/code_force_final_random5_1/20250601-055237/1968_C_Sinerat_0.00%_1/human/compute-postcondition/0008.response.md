Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is n-1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n-1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`. The list `a` will contain the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x`, starting from the first element of `x` and adding each subsequent element to the previous sum. The other variables, `n` and `x`, remain unchanged, and the stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` inputs.
