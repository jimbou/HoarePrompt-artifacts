Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 500, the second element is 500 plus the first element of `x`, the third element is 500 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x`, the fourth element is 500 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x` plus the third element of `x`, and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the current element `x[i - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
