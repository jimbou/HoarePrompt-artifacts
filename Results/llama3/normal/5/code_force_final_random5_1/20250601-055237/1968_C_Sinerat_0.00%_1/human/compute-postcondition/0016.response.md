Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, and the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the current element `x[i - 1]`. The value of `i` remains the same, and the values of `n` and `x` are unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
