Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input integer, x is a list of integers equal to the input list, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are not defined, i is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns the list of integers from the input to `x`. The third line creates a list `a` of `n` zeros. The fourth line assigns 500 to the first element of `a`. The value of `i` is not defined in the given code snippet, so it is not included in the output state. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
