To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop variable `_` is not used anywhere in the loop body, so we don't need to worry about its value.
2. The `range` function is used with `int(input())` as its argument. This means that the loop will iterate `int(input())` times.
3. Since we're at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `int(input())` has already been consumed once. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, there must be another input available in `stdin`.
4. The state of `n`, `x`, `a`, and `i` is not directly affected by the loop head. However, since we're considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we can assume that the previous iteration has completed, and the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, and `i` are not relevant to the loop head.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the availability of input in `stdin`. Specifically, for the loop to execute again, there must be another input available in `stdin`, which is one less than the number of test cases.

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of `x` starting from the first element, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**
