The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are not defined, `i` is not defined, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 2 and `i` must be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the rest are not defined, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**
