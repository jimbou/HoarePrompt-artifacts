To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the range object created by `range(4)`.

According to the code, the loop will execute 4 times, regardless of the values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `stdin`. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

The state of `n` is already specified as an integer between 1 and 100, which does not affect the execution of the loop. The state of `coord` is an empty list, which also does not affect the execution of the loop. The state of `res` is 0, which is not relevant to the loop execution. The state of `stdin` is empty, which is also not relevant to the loop execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
