Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers sorted in ascending order, res is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, i is 3, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `coord` list is sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple. The `res` variable is calculated as the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points in the sorted `coord` list. The `i` variable remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` remains empty as no input is read from it.
