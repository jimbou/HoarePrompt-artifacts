Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, coord is an empty list, res is 0, stdin is empty**

The code initializes two variables, `coord` and `res`, to an empty list and 0, respectively. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as it is empty and no input operations are performed.
