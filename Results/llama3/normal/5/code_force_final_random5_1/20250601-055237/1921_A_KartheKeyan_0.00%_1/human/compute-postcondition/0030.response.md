Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 98, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers, res is 0, i is 0, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `res`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `coord` list now contains a tuple of two integers, which are the values of `x` and `y` read from the input. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers read from the input.
