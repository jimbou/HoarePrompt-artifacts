Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, coord is a list containing three tuples of two integers, res is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 2**

The code block modifies the `coord` list by appending a new tuple containing two integers, `x` and `y`, which are read from the input. The input is expected to contain a space-separated list of integers, and `stdin` is updated to reflect that it now contains one input. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.
