Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 99, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, i is 4, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The `coord` list is sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, and then by the second element if the first elements are equal. The `res` variable is calculated as the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points in the sorted `coord` list. The values of `i`, `stdin`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
