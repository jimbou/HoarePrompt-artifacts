The code snippet provided attempts to read two integers from the standard input (stdin) and assign them to the variables `x` and `y`, respectively. However, the initial state specifies that stdin is empty, which means there are no inputs to read.

As a result, the `input().split()` expression will raise an EOFError (End Of File Error) because it is trying to read from an empty input stream. This error will prevent the execution of the code, and the state of the variables will not be modified.

Therefore, the final output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 99, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuple (x, y), res is 0, i is at least 2 and less than 4, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer**
