Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, and prints this value. The function repeats this process t times, until all test cases have been processed.**
