According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. The other variables in the loop head are `n`, `coord`, `res`, `stdin`, `x`, and `y`, but they are not relevant to the loop condition. Therefore, only the state of `i` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 98, `coord` is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuple (x, y), `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer**
