The value of `n` is decremented by 1, and the previous value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. So the value of `n` is now an integer between 0 and 99. The values of the other variables are not affected. The absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points is still being printed. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 99, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of two integers sorted in ascending order, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `i` is 3, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points is being printed**
