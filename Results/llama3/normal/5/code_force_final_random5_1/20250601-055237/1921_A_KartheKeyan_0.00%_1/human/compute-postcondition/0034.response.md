Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 98, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuples (x, y) and (x, y), res is 0, i is 2, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer**

The code snippet first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables x and y. Since stdin is empty, this operation does not modify the state of stdin. The second line appends the tuple (x, y) to the list coord. The initial state of coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuple (x, y). After the execution of the code, coord will contain the same initial tuple and the new tuple (x, y). The values of n, res, i, and stdin remain unchanged.
