Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 99, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers, res is 0, i is at least 0 and less than 4, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `coord` list, initially empty, now contains a tuple of two integers, which are the values of `x` and `y` obtained from the input. The `res` variable remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged, still being at least 0 and less than 4. The stdin, initially empty, now contains one input, which is a space-separated list of integers.
