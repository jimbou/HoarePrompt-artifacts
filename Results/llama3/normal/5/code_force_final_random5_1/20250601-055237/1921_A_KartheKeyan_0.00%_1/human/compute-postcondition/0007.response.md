The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `coord` is a list containing two tuples of two integers, `res` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2**
