The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer between 0 and 98, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 98, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `i` is 4, `stdin` is empty, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points is being printed.**
