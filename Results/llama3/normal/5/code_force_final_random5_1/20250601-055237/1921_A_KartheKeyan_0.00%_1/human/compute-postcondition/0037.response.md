The code prints the value of `res`, which is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in the `coord` list.

Since the `coord` list contains tuples (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y) sorted in ascending order, we can assume that the first and second tuples are the same, and the third and fourth tuples are the same.

Let's denote the x and y coordinates of the first tuple as x1 and y1, and the x and y coordinates of the third tuple as x3 and y3.

The sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples is (x1 - x1)^2 + (y1 - y1)^2 = 0.

The sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples is (x3 - x3)^2 + (y3 - y3)^2 = 0.

The product of the square roots of these sums is sqrt(0) * sqrt(0) = 0.

The absolute value of this product is |0| = 0.

Therefore, the value of `res` is 0.

Output: **0**
