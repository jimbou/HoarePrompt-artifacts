Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers, res is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The `coord` list, which was initially empty, now contains a tuple of two integers, `x` and `y`, which were read from the input. The `res` variable remains 0 as it was not affected by the code. The `stdin` is now empty as the input has been read. The value of `i` remains 0 as it was not modified by the code.
