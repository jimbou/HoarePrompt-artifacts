Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 99, coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 4, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 99, the list `coord` now contains four tuples of two integers each, the variable `res` remains 0, the loop counter `i` has reached 4, the standard input `stdin` is empty, and the variables `x` and `y` are integers.
