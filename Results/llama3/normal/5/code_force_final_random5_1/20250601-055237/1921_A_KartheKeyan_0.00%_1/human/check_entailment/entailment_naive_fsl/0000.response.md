Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of increasing x-coordinates. The program assumes that the first two points are adjacent and the last two points are adjacent, which is not necessarily true. 

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 2
1 5
4 5

The program will calculate the distance between (1,2) and (4,2) as the side length, which is incorrect. The correct side length is the distance between (1,2) and (1,5) or (4,2) and (4,5).

The program should find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and the minimum and maximum y-coordinates to correctly calculate the side length of the square.
