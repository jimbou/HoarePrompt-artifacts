Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, stdin is empty, i is 3**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable "n" remains an integer between 1 and 100, the list "coord" now contains four tuples of two integers each, the variable "res" remains 0, the standard input "stdin" is empty, and the loop counter "i" is 3.
