The code snippet consists of two lines: `coord = []` and `res = 0`. 

The first line assigns an empty list to `coord`, overwriting its previous value. The second line assigns 0 to `res`, overwriting its previous value.

The initial state of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `stdin` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 98, coord is an empty list, res is 0, i is 4, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer**
