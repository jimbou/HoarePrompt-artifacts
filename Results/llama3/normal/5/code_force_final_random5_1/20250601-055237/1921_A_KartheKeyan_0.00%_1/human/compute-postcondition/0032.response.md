Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 98, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuple (x, y), res is 0, i is 1, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `y`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not affect `stdin`. The second line appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. 

The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` are not affected by the code block, so they remain the same. The value of `x` and `y` are updated to the integer values of the input. The list `coord` is updated to include the tuple `(x, y)`. The state of `stdin` remains empty.
