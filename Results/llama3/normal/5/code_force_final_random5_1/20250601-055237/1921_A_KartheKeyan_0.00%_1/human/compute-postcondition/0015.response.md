Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 99, coord is an empty list, res is 0, i is 3, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`, effectively clearing its previous value. The second line assigns the value 0 to the variable `res`, overwriting its previous value. The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, as it is empty.
