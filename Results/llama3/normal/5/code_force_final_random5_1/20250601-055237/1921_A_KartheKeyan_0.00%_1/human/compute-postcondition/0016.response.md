The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If i is at least 0 and less than 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 99, coord is an empty list, res is 0, i is 3, stdin is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is at least 0 and less than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than 4, stdin is empty**
