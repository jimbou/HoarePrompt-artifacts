Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 98, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `i` is 4, `stdin` is empty, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 98. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The program is still printing the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points.
