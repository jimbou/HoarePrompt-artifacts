Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 98, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuples (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y), res is 0, i is 3, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the variable "n" remains an integer between 1 and 98, the list "coord" contains four tuples of two integers each, the variable "res" remains 0, the variable "i" is now 3, the standard input "stdin" is empty, and the variables "x" and "y" are integers.
