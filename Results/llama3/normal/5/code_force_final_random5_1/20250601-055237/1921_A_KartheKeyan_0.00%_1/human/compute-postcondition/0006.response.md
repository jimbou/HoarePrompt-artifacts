The code snippet reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns them to the variables x and y. These values are then appended to the coord list as a tuple. The initial state of coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers, so after the execution of the code, coord will contain two tuples of two integers each. The values of n, res, and i remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Stdin is initially empty after the execution of the code.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers, res is 0, stdin is empty, i is 1**
