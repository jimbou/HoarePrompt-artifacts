Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 98, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuples (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y) sorted in ascending order, res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples, i is 3, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer**

The code sorts the list of tuples in ascending order, calculates the squared differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples, takes the square roots of these sums, multiplies them together, and assigns the absolute value of the result to the variable res. The values of n, i, stdin, x, and y remain unchanged.
