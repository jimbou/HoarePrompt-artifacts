The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 98, `coord` is a list containing a tuple of two integers, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer**
