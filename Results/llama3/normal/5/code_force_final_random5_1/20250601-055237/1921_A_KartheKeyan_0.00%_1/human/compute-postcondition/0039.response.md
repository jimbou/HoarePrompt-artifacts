Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 97, `coord` is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuples (x, y), (x, y), and (x, y) sorted in ascending order, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 97. The values of the other variables remain the same, including the list `coord`, the result `res`, the index `i`, the empty standard input `stdin`, and the integers `x` and `y`. The absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples is still being printed.
