Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 99, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and the tuple (x, y), res is 0, i is at least 1 and less than 4, stdin is empty, x is an integer, y is an integer**

The code block reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin, assigning the first integer to x and the second integer to y. Since stdin initially contains one input, it becomes empty after this operation. The code then appends the tuple (x, y) to the list coord. The values of n, res, and i remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
