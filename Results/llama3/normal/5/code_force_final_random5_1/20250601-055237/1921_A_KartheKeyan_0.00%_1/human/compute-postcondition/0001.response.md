According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer between 0 and 100, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is not zero.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `stdin` is empty**
