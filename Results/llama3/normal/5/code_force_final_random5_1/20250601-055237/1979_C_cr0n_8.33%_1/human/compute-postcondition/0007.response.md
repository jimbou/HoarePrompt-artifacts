Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is an empty list, prod is an integer between 2^1 and 20^50 inclusive, r is the last integer in the list vals.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the stdin will still contain multiple test cases minus one test case, N will still be an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals will be an empty list because all its elements have been processed, prod will be an integer between 2^1 and 20^50 inclusive because it has been multiplied by all the integers in vals, and r will be the last integer in the list vals because it is the last value that was processed in the loop.
