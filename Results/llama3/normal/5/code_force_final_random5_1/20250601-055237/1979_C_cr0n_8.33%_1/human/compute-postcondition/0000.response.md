Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod is 1**

The code reads two lines from stdin for a single test case. The first line assigns an integer value to N, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of n integers to vals, where each integer is between 2 and 20 inclusive. The variable prod is initialized to 1. After executing this code, stdin will contain one less test case.
