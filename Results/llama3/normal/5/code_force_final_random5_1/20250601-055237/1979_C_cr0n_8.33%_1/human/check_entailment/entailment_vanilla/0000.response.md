Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, and it outputs the bets for each outcome.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and iterating over each case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (N) and the multipliers for each outcome (vals).

3. It calculates the product of all multipliers (prod) and then calculates the product of all multipliers except each individual multiplier (vprod).

4. It calculates the denominator (den) by subtracting the sum of vprod from prod.

5. If the denominator is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

6. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome, which are the values in vprod.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the product of all multipliers and the product of all multipliers except each individual multiplier. It also correctly checks if the denominator is less than or equal to 0 and prints -1 if so. If the denominator is greater than 0, it correctly prints the bets for each outcome.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program assumes that the bets for each outcome should be the product of all multipliers except the multiplier for that outcome. This is not necessarily true. The correct approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers and then calculate the bets for each outcome based on the LCM.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
