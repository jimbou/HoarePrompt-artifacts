Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then calculates the value for each outcome by dividing the product by the multiplier for that outcome. The denominator is then calculated as the product minus the sum of the values for all outcomes. If the denominator is less than or equal to 0, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program prints -1.

Otherwise, the program prints the values for each outcome, which are the bets on the outcomes. The program ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, as required by the problem description.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
