Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, calculates the product of a list of integers, and then calculates the denominator as the product minus the sum of the products of all possible combinations of the integers. If the denominator is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and returns without a value. Otherwise, it prints the list of products of all possible combinations of the integers, but since the list is empty, it effectively prints an empty string.**
