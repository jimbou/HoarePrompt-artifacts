Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `n` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `prod` is an integer between 8 and 8000 inclusive, `r` is the third integer in the list `vals`.**

In this output state, the value of `prod` has been updated by multiplying it with the value of `r`, which is the third integer in the list `vals`. The range of `prod` has been updated to be between 8 and 8000 inclusive, considering the minimum and maximum possible values of `prod` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.
