Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `n` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `prod` is an integer between 4 and 400 inclusive, `r` is the second integer in the list `vals`.**

The value of `prod` is updated by multiplying it with `r`, which is the second integer in the list `vals`. Since `prod` was initially between 2 and 20 inclusive, and `r` is also between 2 and 20 inclusive, the new value of `prod` will be between 4 and 400 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
