To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `r` and the list `vals`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `vals`. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Since `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `vals` is a list of `n` integers, we can infer that `n` is equal to `N`.

At the start of the loop, `r` should be the first integer in the list `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must have at least 1 integer.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, prod is 1, r is the first integer in the list vals**
