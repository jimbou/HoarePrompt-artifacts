The only variable in the loop head is variable `r` and list `vals`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `vals`. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `vals` has at least 2 integers, `r` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `r` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `n` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `prod` is an integer between 4 and 400 inclusive, `r` is the third integer in the list `vals`.**
