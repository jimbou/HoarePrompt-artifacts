Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, and `i` is 31.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    cur = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if cur >> j & 1:
            suf[j][1] += 1
        else:
            suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element at index `j` is 1 if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, otherwise the first element of the list at index `j` is 1 and the second element is 0, except at index `j=1` where the second element is increased by 1 if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, otherwise the first element of the list at index `j` is 2 and

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
