Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1 ^ 0, v2 ^ v1, ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1), where vi is the ith element in the list, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(32):
    pre[i][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is 1 and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is 2 and the second element is 0 for `i` = 1, and the first element of the list at index `i` is 1 and the second element is 0 for `i` != 1, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is 2 and the second element is 0 for `i` = 1, and the first element of the list at index `i` is 2 and the second element is 0 for `i` = 2, and the first element of the list at index `i` is 1 and the second element is 0 for `i` != 1 and `i` != 2, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, and `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
