Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, `prefix` is a list containing at least four elements: 0, `v1 ^ 0`, `v2 ^ v1`, and `v ^ (v2 ^ v1)`, `v` is the second element in the list**

The code appends a new element to the `prefix` list, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list. The last element of the `prefix` list is `v2 ^ v1`, so the new element is `v ^ (v2 ^ v1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
