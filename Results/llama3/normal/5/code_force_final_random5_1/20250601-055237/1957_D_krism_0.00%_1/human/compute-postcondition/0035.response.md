Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element at index `j` is 1 if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, otherwise the first element of the list at index `j` is 1 and the second element is 0, except at index `j=1` where the second element is increased by 1 if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, otherwise the first element of the list at index `j` is 2 and the second element is 0, except at index `j=2` where the first element is increased by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the value of `prefix` at index `n`, and `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the first element of the list at index 2 in `suf` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
