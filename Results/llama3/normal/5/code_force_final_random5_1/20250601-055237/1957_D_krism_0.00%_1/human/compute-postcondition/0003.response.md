According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, n is an integer, prefix is a list containing a single element 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the variable v is the first element in the list.
State: **stdin contains t-1 lines of input, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, prefix is a list containing a single element 0, v is the first element in the list**
