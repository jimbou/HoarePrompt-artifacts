Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is 0, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, depending on the bit at position j in the binary representation of cur. If the bit at position j in the binary representation of cur is 1, the second element at index j in suf is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n. If the bit at position j in the binary representation of cur is 0, the first element at index j in suf is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n. stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 1, cur is the value of prefix at index 0, j is 31, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is either 0 or 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j is either -1 or 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 1, cur is the value of prefix at index 0, j is at least 0 and at most 31, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1. If the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, the second element at index j in suf is either -1 or 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n. If the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 0, the first element at index j in suf is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, except for the list at index j where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n-1 and the second element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is either 0 or 1, except for the list at index j where the second element is either 1 or 2 or ... or n+1 if the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the first element at index j in pre is one more than its original value. suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j is either -2 or -1 or 0 or 1 or ... or n-1 if the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the first element at index j in suf is one less than its original value. stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 1, cur is the value of prefix at index 0, j is at least 1 and at most 31, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is either 0 or 1, except for the list at index j where the second element is either 1 or 2 or ... or n+1 if the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the first element at index j in pre is one more than its original value. suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j is either -2 or -1 or 0 or 1 or ... or n-1 if the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the first element at index j in suf is one less than its original value. stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 1, cur is the value of prefix at index 0, j is at least 2 and at most 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1. If the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, then the second element of the list at index j in pre is either 2 or 3 or ... or n+2, and the second element at index j in suf is either -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-2. Otherwise, the first element at index j in pre is one more than its original value, and the first element at index j in suf is one less than its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
