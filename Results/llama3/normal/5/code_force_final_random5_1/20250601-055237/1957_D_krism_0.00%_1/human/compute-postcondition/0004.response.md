Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, `prefix` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `v ^ 0`, `v` is the first element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `prefix` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of `prefix` (which is 0). This new element is `v ^ 0`, which is equal to `v` itself. The other variables remain unchanged.
