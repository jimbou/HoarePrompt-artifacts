Output State: **n is greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is either 0 or 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j is either -1 or 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 1, cur is the value of prefix at index 0, j is at least 0 and at most 31, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1.**

The code modifies the values of `pre[j][1]` and `suf[j][1]`. The first line increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1, and the second line decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
