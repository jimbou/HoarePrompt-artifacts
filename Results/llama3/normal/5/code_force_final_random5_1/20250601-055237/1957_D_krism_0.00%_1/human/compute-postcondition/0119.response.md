Output State: **n is greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is either 0 or 1, except for the list at index j+31 where the second element is either 3 or 4 or ... or n+3, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j+31 is either -4 or -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-3, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 3, cur is the value of prefix at index 2, j is at least 0 and less than 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1. The bit at position j+31 in the binary representation of c is 1, the second element of the list at index j+31 in pre is either 3 or 4 or ... or n+3, and the second element at index j+31 in suf is either -4 or -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-3.**
