Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element at index `j` is 1 and 0 at other indices, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the value of `prefix` at index `n`, `j` is 0, and the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][1]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `suf[j][1]` being 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
