To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is the loop variable, it will start from `n` and decrement by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, and `i` is `n`**
