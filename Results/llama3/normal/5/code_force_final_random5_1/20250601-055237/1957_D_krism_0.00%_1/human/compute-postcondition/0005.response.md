To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, and `v` is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `v` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, `prefix` is a list containing at least three elements: 0, `v1 ^ 0`, and `v2 ^ v1`, `v` is the second element in the list**
