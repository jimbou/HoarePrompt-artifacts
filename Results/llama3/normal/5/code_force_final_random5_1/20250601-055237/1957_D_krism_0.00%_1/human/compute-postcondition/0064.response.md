Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the second element at index `j` is either 32 or 0 or 1 or 2, depending on the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur`. If the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, the second element at index `j` is either 32 or increased by 1, otherwise the first element at index `j` is either 1 or increased by 1. `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `i` is `n-2`, `cur` is the value of `prefix` at index `n-2`, and `j` is either 0 or 1 and the range is 32.**
