Output State: **n is greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is either 0 or 1, except for the list at index j where the second element is either 1 or 2 or ... or n+1 if the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the first element at index j in pre is one more than its original value. suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j is either -2 or -1 or 0 or 1 or ... or n-1 if the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the first element at index j in suf is one less than its original value. stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 1, cur is the value of prefix at index 0, j is 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the state of the variables has been updated accordingly. The value of `j` is now 32, indicating that the loop has completed all 32 iterations. The values of `pre` and `suf` have been updated based on the bits of `c`, with the second element of `pre` at index `j` being either 1 or 2 or ... or n+1 if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `c` is 1, and the second element of `suf` at index `j` being either -2 or -1 or 0 or 1 or ... or n-1 if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `c` is 1. The values of `i`, `cur`, `ans`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
