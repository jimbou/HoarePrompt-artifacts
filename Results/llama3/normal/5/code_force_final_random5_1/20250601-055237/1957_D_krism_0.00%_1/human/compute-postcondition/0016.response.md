The value of `pre[i][0]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 1, the first element of the list at index 1 in `pre` is incremented by 1. The first element of the list at index 1 in `pre` was 1, so it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is 2 and the second element is 0 for `i` = 1, and the first element of the list at index `i` is 1 and the second element is 0 for `i` != 1, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is 2 and the second element is 0 for `i` = 1, and the first element of the list at index `i` is 1 and the second element is 0 for `i` != 1, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, and `i` is 1.**
