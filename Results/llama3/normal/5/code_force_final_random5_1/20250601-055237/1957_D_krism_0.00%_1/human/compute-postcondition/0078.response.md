The code prints a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `j` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n` and the second element at index `j` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n`, depending on the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur`. If the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, the second element at index `j` in `suf` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n`. If the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 0, the first element at index `j` in `suf` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n`. 
Output: **a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index j is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, depending on the bit at position j in the binary representation of cur**
