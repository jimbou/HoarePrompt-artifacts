The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either 0 or 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the second element at index `j` is either 32 or 0 or 1 or 2, depending on the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur`. If the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, the second element at index `j` is either 32 or increased by 1, otherwise the first element at index `j` is either 1 or increased by 1. `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `i` is `n-2`, `cur` is the value of `prefix` at index `n-2`, and `j` is either 1 or 2 and the range is 32**
