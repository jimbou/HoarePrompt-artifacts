Output State: **n is greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1, except for the list at index j+1 where the first element is i+2, and the second element is either 0 or 1, except for the list at index j+1 where the second element is either 2 or 3 or ... or n+2 if the bit at position j+1 in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the second element at index j+1 in pre is either 0 or 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, except for the list at index j+1 where the first element is either -1 or 0 or 1 or ... or n-1, and the second element at index j+1 is either -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-2 if the bit at position j+1 in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the second element at index j+1 in suf is either -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-2, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 2, cur is the value of prefix at index 1, j is at least 2 and less than 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1. The bit at position j+1 in the binary representation of c is either 0 or 1. If the bit at position j+1 in the binary representation of c is 1, then the second element of the list at index j+1 in pre is either 2 or 3 or ... or n+2, and the second element at index j+1 in suf is either -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-2. If the bit at position j+1 in the binary representation of c is 0, then the first element at index j+1 in pre is two more than its original value, and the first element at index j+1 in suf is one less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The code modifies the `pre` and `suf` lists. In the `pre` list, the first element at index `j+1` is incremented by 1, and in the `suf` list, the first element at index `j+1` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The `pre` list now has the first element at index `j+1` as `i+2` instead of `i+1`, and the second element at index `j+1` remains either 0 or 1, or 2 or 3 or ... or n+2 if the bit at position `j+1` in the binary representation of `c` is 1. The `suf` list now has the first element at index `j+1` as either -1 or 0 or 1 or ... or n-1 instead of 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, and the second element at index `j+1` remains either -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-2.
