The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at most 31. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is either 0 or 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j is either -1 or 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 1, cur is the value of prefix at index 0, j is at least 1 and at most 31, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1. If the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 1, the second element at index j in suf is either -1 or 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n. If the bit at position j in the binary representation of c is 0, the first element at index j in suf is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n, except for the list at index j where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n-1 and the second element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n.**
