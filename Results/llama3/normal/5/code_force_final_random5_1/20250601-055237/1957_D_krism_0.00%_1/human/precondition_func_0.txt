stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
