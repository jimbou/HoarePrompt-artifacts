Functionality: This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the prefix XOR of the list and initializes two lists, pre and suf, to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s in the binary representation of the prefix XOR at each position. It then iterates over the list in reverse order, updating the suf list and calculates the sum of products of corresponding elements from the pre and suf lists for the indices k that are equal to the bit length of y minus 1, where y is the last element of the arr list. Finally, it prints the calculated sum.
