Output State: **n is greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index i is i+1 and the second element is either 0 or 1, except for the list at index j+31 where the second element is either 2 or 3 or ... or n+2 if the bit at position j+31 in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the first element at index j+31 in pre is two more than its original value, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n and the second element at index j+31 is either -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-2 if the bit at position j+31 in the binary representation of c is 1, otherwise the first element at index j+31 in suf is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, i is 2, cur is the value of prefix at index 1, j is 32, ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k = y.bit_length() - 1 where y is arr[i - 1], c is the value of prefix at index i, y is the value of arr at index i-1, k is the bit length of y minus 1, ans is increased by pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] where k is the bit length of y minus 1. The bit at position j+31 in the binary representation of c is either 0 or 1. If the bit at position j+31 in the binary representation of c is 1, then the second element of the list at index j+31 in pre is either 2 or 3 or ... or n+2, and the second element at index j+31 in suf is either -3 or -2 or -1 or 0 or ... or n-2. If the bit at position j+31 in the binary representation of c is 0, then the first element at index j+31 in pre is two more than its original value, and the first element at index j+31 in suf is one less than its original value.**

This output state describes the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates 32 times, and in each iteration, it updates the elements of the `pre` and `suf` lists based on the bits of the binary representation of `c`. The `j` variable is incremented in each iteration, and the loop ends when `j` reaches 32. The final state of the program reflects the updates made to the `pre` and `suf` lists after all iterations of the loop have completed.
