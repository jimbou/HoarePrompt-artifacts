Output State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, and `i` is 31.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

* The integer `n` and the list `arr` of `n` integers remain unchanged.
* The list `prefix` containing `n+1` elements also remains unchanged.
* The list `pre` of 32 lists, each containing two elements, has its first element at each index `i` incremented to `i+1`, while the second element remains 0.
* The list `suf` of 32 lists, each containing two elements, remains initialized to 0.
* The input `stdin` still contains `t-1` lines of input.
* The loop counter `i` has reached its final value of 31, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
