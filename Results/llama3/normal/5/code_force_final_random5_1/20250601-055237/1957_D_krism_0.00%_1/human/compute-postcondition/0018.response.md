The value of `pre[i][0]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is 2. The first element of the list at index `i` is 1 and the second element is 0 for `i` != 1, so the value of `pre[2][0]` is 1 and it is incremented by 1 to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is 2 and the second element is 0 for `i` = 1, and the first element of the list at index `i` is 2 and the second element is 0 for `i` = 2, and the first element of the list at index `i` is 1 and the second element is 0 for `i` != 1 and `i` != 2, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, and `i` is 2**
