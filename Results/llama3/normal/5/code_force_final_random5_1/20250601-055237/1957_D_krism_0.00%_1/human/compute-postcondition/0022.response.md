Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `i` is `n`, and `cur` is the value of `prefix` at index `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` is now the element at index `n` in the `prefix` list. All other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer greater than 0, `arr` still being a list of `n` integers, `prefix` still containing `n+1` elements, `pre` and `suf` still being lists of 32 lists with their respective initializations, `stdin` still containing `t-1` lines of input, and `i` still being equal to `n`.
