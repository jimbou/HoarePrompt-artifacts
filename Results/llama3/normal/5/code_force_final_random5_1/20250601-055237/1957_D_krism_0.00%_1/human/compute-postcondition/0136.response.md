Functionality: This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the prefix XOR of the list and then processes the list in reverse order, updating two lists (pre and suf) based on the binary representation of the prefix XOR values. Finally, it calculates a sum (ans) by iterating over the list and updating the pre and suf lists, and prints the result. The function does not modify the input or have any side effects other than printing the result.
