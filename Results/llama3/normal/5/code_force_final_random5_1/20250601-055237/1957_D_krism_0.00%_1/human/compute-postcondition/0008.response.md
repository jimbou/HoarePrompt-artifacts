Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 elements, `prefix` is a list containing at least five elements: 0, `v1 ^ 0`, `v2 ^ v1`, `v ^ (v2 ^ v1)`, and `v ^ (v ^ (v2 ^ v1))`, `v` is the third element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `prefix` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of `prefix`. The values of `stdin`, `n`, `arr`, and `v` remain unchanged.
