Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines of input, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing a single element 0**.

The code reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains an integer t, and assigns it to the variable n. This leaves t-1 lines of input in stdin. Then, it reads the next line of input, which contains n integers, and assigns it to the variable arr. Finally, it initializes a list called prefix with a single element 0.
