Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines of input, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements: 0, v1 ^ 0, v2 ^ v1, ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1), where vi is the ith element in the list**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same stdin and n as the initial state. The list arr will be the same as the initial list of n integers. The prefix list will have n+1 elements, where each element is the result of the XOR operation between the current element in the list and the previous element in the prefix list. The first element in the prefix list is always 0.
