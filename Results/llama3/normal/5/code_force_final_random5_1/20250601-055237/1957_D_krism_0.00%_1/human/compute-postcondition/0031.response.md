Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element of the list at index `i` is `i+1` and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements where the first element at index `j` is 1 if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, otherwise the first element of the list at index `j` is 2 and the second element is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the value of `prefix` at index `n`, and `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][0]` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suf[j][0]` is now 2 if the bit at position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1, otherwise it is 2.
