Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the list of integers, `i` is the second element of `nums`, and `curr` is `i - last` if the second element of `nums` is not equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is 0. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is increased by `i - last`.**
