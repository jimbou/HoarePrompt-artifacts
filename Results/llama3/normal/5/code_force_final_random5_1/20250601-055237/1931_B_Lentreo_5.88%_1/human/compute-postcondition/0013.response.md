Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is an empty list, last is an integer equal to the last element of the original list of integers, curr is the sum of all the non-zero integers in the original list minus the last element of the original list times the number of non-zero integers in the original list. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of integers is empty, the last element is the last element of the original list, and the current value is the sum of all non-zero integers in the original list minus the last element of the original list times the number of non-zero integers in the original list. The number of test cases and the stdin remain unchanged.
