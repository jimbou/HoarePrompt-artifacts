Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the list of integers, `i` is the third element of `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is increased by the difference between the third element of `nums` and the second last element of the list of integers. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
