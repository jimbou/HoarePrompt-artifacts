The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer `n`, the first integer read from the input is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The sum of a_i is divisible by n.**
