Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then checks if the sum of all elements in the list except the last one is equal to zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program repeats this process for all test cases.

The program's logic is correct because it takes advantage of the fact that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. This means that if the last element of the list is equal to the average of all elements, then the sum of all elements except the last one must be zero. The program checks this condition and prints 'YES' if it is true, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
