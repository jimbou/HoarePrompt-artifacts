Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be equal to 0, _ is equal to t, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, curr is the sum of all elements in nums except the last one, i is the last element of the list of integers. No more 'YES' or 'NO' is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `_` is equal to `t`, which means the loop has iterated `t` times. The variables `n`, `nums`, `last`, `curr`, and `i` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Since the loop has finished executing, no more 'YES' or 'NO' is being printed.
