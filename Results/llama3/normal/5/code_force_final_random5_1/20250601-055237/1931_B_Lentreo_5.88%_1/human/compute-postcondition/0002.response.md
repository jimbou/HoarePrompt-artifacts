Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums, curr is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code reads one test case from stdin, consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It assigns the last element of `nums` to `last` and initializes `curr` to 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0, as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains one less test case.
