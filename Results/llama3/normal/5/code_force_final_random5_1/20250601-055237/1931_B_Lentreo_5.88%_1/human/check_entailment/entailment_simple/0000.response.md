Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The key insight is that if the sum of the differences between each container's water level and the last container's water level is zero, then it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. This is because we can pour water from containers with more water than the last container to containers with less water than the last container, until all containers have the same amount of water.

The program correctly calculates this sum of differences by iterating over the list of water levels and adding the difference between each level and the last level to the `curr` variable. If `curr` is zero at the end, it means that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, and the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Correctness: **True**
