This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then checks if the sum of all elements in the list except the last one is equal to zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
