Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, curr is the sum of all elements in nums except the last one, i is the last element of the list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `curr` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one, and the variable `i` will hold the last element of the list `nums`. The other variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, and `last` will remain unchanged.
