Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the list of integers, `i` is the second element of `nums`, and `curr` is `i - last` if the second element of `nums` is not equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is 0, then `curr` is increased by `i - last`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, the value of `_` is still 1, and the value of `n` is still an integer. The list of integers `nums` still has at least 2 elements, and the value of `last` is still the second last element of `nums`. The value of `i` is still the second element of `nums`. The value of `curr` is increased by `i - last`, which means it is now equal to `2 * (i - last)` if the second element of `nums` is not equal to 0, otherwise it is still 0.
