Let's break down the code and its impact on the program.

The code is `curr += i - last`. This means we are adding the difference between `i` and `last` to the current value of `curr`.

From the initial state, we know that `i` is the second element of `nums`, and `last` is the second last element of `nums`. We also know that `curr` is either `i - last` or 0, depending on whether the first integer in `nums` is 0 or not.

Let's consider two cases:

1. If the first integer in `nums` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is initially `i - last`. In this case, `curr` will be updated to `(i - last) + (i - last) = 2i - 2last`.
2. If the first integer in `nums` is 0, then `curr` is initially 0. In this case, `curr` will be updated to `0 + (i - last) = i - last`.

In both cases, the value of `curr` is updated based on the values of `i` and `last`.

The other variables, `t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, and `last`, are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of `nums`, `i` is the second element of `nums`, and `curr` is either `2i - 2last` or `i - last`, depending on whether the first integer in `nums` is 0 or not.**
