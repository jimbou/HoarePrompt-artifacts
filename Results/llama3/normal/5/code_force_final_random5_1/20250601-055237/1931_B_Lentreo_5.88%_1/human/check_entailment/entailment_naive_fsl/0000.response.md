Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES". The reason is that the program only checks if the sum of the differences between each number and the last number is zero, but it does not consider the fact that water can be poured from one container to another.

In this case, the program does not work correctly because it does not consider the possibility of pouring water from the first container to the second container, and then from the second container to the third container, to make the amounts of water in all containers the same.

A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the amounts of water in each container is divisible by the number of containers, and if it is possible to pour water from one container to another to make the amounts of water in all containers the same.
