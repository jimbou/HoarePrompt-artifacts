Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, curr is 0, i is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers. If the first element of `nums`, `i`, is not equal to 0, then `curr` is `i - last`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `i` is the second element of the list of integers. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is 2 * `i` - 2 * `last` if the first element of `nums` is not equal to 0, else `curr` is `i - last`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `i` is the third element of the list of integers. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is 3 * `i` - 3 * `last` if the first element of `nums` is not equal to 0, else `curr` is 2 * `i` - 2 * `last`. If `i` is equal to 0, then the values of `curr`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, `last` and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
