To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The objects involved are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.

The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the original list of integers, `curr` is the sum of all the non-zero integers in the original list minus the last element of the original list times the number of non-zero integers in the original list**
