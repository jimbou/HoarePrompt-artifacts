The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the original list of integers, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each element and the previous element in the original list of integers, excluding the first element if it is 0, and `i` is the last element of the original list of integers. If the sum of the differences between each element and the previous element in the original list of integers, excluding the first element if it is 0, is equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
