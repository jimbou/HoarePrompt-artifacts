Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums, curr is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums, if the first integer in the list is not equal to 0, then curr is i - last. Otherwise, curr remains 0. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, last is an integer equal to the second last element of nums, i is the second element of nums. If the first integer in the list is not equal to 0, then curr is 2i - 2last. Otherwise, curr is i - last.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of `nums`, `i` is the third element of `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is either 4i - 3last if the first integer in the list is not equal to 0, otherwise 2i - 2last. If `i` is equal to 0, then no changes are made to `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
