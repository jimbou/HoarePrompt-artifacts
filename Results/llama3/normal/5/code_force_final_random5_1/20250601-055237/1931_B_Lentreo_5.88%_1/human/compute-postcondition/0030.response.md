To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for i in nums:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the `nums` list. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes on the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1.
* `_` is 1 (this variable is not relevant to the loop).
* `n` is an integer (not relevant to the loop).
* `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.
* `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the list of integers.
* `i` is the second element of `nums`.
* `curr` is `i - last` if the second element of `nums` is not equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is 0. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is increased by `i - last`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the `nums` list. Since `i` is currently the second element, the next element will be the third element in the list.

Assuming the list has at least 3 elements (since `nums` must have at least 2 elements), the next iteration will assign the third element of `nums` to `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `last`, and `curr`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the list of integers, `i` is the third element of `nums`, and `curr` is the same as before (since it's not directly affected by the loop head)**
