Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The sum of a_i is divisible by n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    last = nums[-1]
    curr = 0
    for i in nums:
        if i != 0:
            curr += i - last
    if curr == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is an empty list, last is an integer equal to the last element of the original list of integers, curr is the sum of all the non-zero integers in the original list minus the last element of the original list times the number of non-zero integers in the original list. If curr is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the original list of integers, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each element and the previous element in the original list of integers, excluding the first element if it is 0, and `i` is the last element of the original list of integers. If the sum of the differences between each element and the previous element in the original list of integers, excluding the first element if it is 0, is equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, curr is the sum of all elements in nums except the last one, i is the last element of the list of integers. If curr is equal to 0, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
