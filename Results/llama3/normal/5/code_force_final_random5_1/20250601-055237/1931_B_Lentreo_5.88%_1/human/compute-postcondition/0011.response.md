Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of `nums`, `i` is the third element of `nums`, `curr` is either 4i - 3last if the first integer in the list is not equal to 0, otherwise 2i - 2last.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0, the variable `_` remains 0, and the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `nums` are unchanged. The second last element of `nums` is still stored in `last`, and the third element of `nums` is still stored in `i`. The value of `curr` has been updated by adding the difference between the third element `i` and the second last element `last` to its previous value. If the first integer in the list is not 0, `curr` is now 4 times the third element minus 3 times the second last element. Otherwise, `curr` is now 2 times the third element minus 2 times the second last element.
