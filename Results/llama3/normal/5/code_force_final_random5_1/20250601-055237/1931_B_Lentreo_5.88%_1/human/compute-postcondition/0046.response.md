Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers. If the first element of `nums`, `i`, is not equal to 0, then `curr` is `i - last`.***
