To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for i in nums:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `nums` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` has at least 1 element, and `last` is equal to the last element of `nums`.

To execute the loop again, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be the second element of `nums`. Since `last` is equal to the last element of `nums`, we can't determine its new value. However, we can say that `last` is equal to the last element of `nums`, which is now the second element.

The other variables `_`, `n`, and `t` are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

If the first element of `nums` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is `i - last`. Since `i` is now the second element of `nums`, we can't determine its value. However, we can say that `curr` is `i - last`, where `i` is the second element of `nums` and `last` is the last element of `nums`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `i` is the second element of the list of integers. If the first element of `nums` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is `i - last`.**
