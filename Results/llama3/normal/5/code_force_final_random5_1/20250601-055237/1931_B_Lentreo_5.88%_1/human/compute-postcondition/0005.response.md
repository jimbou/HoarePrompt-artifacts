Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of `nums`, `curr` is `i - last`, `i` is the first integer in the list and is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to be the difference between the first integer `i` and the last element `last` of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
