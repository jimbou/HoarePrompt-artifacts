The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If nums has at least 1 integer the loop executes. Before the loop starts, t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums, curr is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, last is an integer equal to the last element of nums, curr is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is the first integer in the list**
