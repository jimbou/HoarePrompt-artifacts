Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of `nums`, `i` is the third element of `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is either 4i - 3last if the first integer in the list is not equal to 0, otherwise 2i - 2last. If `i` is equal to 0, then no changes are made to `curr`.***
