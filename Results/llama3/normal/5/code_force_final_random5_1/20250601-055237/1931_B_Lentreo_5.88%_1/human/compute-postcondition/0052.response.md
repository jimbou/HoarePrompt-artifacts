Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `i` is the third element of the list of integers. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is 3 * `i` - 3 * `last` if the first element of `nums` is not equal to 0, else `curr` is 2 * `i` - 2 * `last`. If `i` is equal to 0, then the values of `curr`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, `last` and `i` remain unchanged.***
