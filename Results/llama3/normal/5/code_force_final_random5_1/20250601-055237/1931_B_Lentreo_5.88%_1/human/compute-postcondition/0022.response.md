Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, last is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, curr is 0**

The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. `n = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `n` is now an integer.

2. `nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))`: This line reads a list of integers from the input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into individual integers, converts each integer to an integer using the `map` function, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`. The value of `nums` is now a list of integers.

3. `last = nums[-1]`: This line assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. The value of `last` is now an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers.

4. `curr = 0`: This line assigns the value 0 to the variable `curr`. The value of `curr` is now 0.

The final state of the variables after the code executes is:

* `t` remains an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1.
* `_` remains 1.
* `n` is now an integer.
* `nums` is now a list of integers.
* `last` is now an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers.
* `curr` is now 0.

Note that the original values of `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` are updated by the code, while the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
