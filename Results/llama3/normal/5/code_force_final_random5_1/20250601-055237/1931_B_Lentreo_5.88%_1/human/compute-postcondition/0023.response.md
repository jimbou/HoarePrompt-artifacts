To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. Since `last` is equal to the last element of `nums`, we can infer that `nums` is not empty. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `nums` to have at least one element, and `i` can be set to the first element of `nums`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `curr` is 0, `i` is the first element of `nums`**
