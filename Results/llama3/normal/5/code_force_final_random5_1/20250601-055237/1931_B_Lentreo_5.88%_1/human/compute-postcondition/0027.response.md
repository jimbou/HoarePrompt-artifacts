To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in nums:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element of `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must have at least two elements, and `i` should be the second element of `nums`.

Additionally, since `last` is equal to the last element of the list of integers, and `curr` depends on the first element of `nums`, we need to adjust the states of `last` and `curr` accordingly.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the list of integers, if the second element of `nums` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is `i - last`, otherwise `curr` is 0, and `i` is the second element of `nums`**

Note that we didn't adjust the state of `t`, `_`, or `n` as they are not involved in the loop head.
