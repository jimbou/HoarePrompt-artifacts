Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers.
2.  It then calculates the sum of all elements in the list except the last one and checks if this sum is equal to zero.
3.  If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.
4.  Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. By checking if the sum of all elements except the last one is zero, the program effectively checks if it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount.

Correctness: **True**
