Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `i` is the third element of the list of integers, if `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is 3 * `i` - 3 * `last` if the first element of `nums` is not equal to 0, else `curr` is 2 * `i` - 2 * `last`.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated by adding `i - last` to its previous value. If `i` is not equal to 0, the new value of `curr` depends on whether the first element of `nums` is 0 or not. If it's not 0, `curr` is now 3 times `i` minus 3 times `last`. If it's 0, `curr` is now 2 times `i` minus 2 times `last`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
