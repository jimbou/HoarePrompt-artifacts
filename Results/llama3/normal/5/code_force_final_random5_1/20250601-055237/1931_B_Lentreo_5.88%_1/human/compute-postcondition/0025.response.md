Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `curr` is `i - last`, and `i` is the first element of `nums`.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to be the difference between the first element of the list `nums` (which is `i`) and the last element of the list `nums` (which is `last`). The other variables remain unchanged.
