Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of the list of integers, `i` is the third element of `nums`, and `curr` is increased by the difference between the third element of `nums` and the second last element of the list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, the variable `_` remains 1, and `n` is still an integer. The list of integers `nums` still has at least 3 elements, and `last` is still equal to the second last element of `nums`. The value of `i` is still the third element of `nums`. The only change is in the value of `curr`, which is now increased by the difference between the third element of `nums` and the second last element of the list of integers.
