To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `nums` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of the list, and `last` is the last element of the list.

For the loop to execute again, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element of the list. The value of `last` is not relevant to the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `i` is the third element of the list of integers. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is 2 * `i` - 2 * `last` if the first element of `nums` is not equal to 0, else `curr` is `i - last`.**
