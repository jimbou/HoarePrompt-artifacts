Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `curr` is `i - last`, and the first element of `nums`, `i`, is not equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to `i - last`, where `i` is the first element of the list `nums` and `last` is the last element of the list `nums`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
