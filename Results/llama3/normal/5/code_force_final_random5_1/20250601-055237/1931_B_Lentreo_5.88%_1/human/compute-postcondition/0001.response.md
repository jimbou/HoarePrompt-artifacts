The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The sum of a_i is divisible by n. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The sum of a_i is divisible by n, `_` is 0**
