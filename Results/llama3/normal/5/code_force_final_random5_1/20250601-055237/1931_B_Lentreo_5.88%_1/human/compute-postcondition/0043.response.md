To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. Since `i` is not defined before the loop, we can set it to the first element of `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `last`, and `curr`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the list of integers, `curr` is 0, `i` is the first element of `nums`**
