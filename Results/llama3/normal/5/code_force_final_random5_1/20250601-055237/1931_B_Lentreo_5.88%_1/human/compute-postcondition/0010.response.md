To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `nums` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 integers, and `i` is the second element of `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must have at least 3 integers, and `i` must be the third element of `nums`.

Additionally, we need to update the state of `last` and `curr` based on the new value of `i`. Since we don't know the exact values of the elements in `nums`, we can't determine the exact value of `curr`. However, we can express it in terms of `i` and `last`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `last` is an integer equal to the second last element of `nums`, `i` is the third element of `nums`. If the first integer in the list is not equal to 0, then `curr` is 2i - 2last. Otherwise, `curr` is i - last**
