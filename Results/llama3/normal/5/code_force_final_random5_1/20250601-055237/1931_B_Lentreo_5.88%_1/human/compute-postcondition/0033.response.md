Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is an empty list, `last` is an integer equal to the last element of the original list of integers, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each element and the previous element in the original list of integers, excluding the first element if it is 0, and `i` is the last element of the original list of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `_`, and `n` as in the initial state. The list `nums` will be empty since the loop iterates over all its elements. The variable `last` will hold the last element of the original list of integers. The variable `curr` will hold the sum of the differences between each element and the previous element in the original list of integers, excluding the first element if it is 0. The variable `i` will hold the last element of the original list of integers.
