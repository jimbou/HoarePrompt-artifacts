Output State: **`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, the first character in `s`, `i`, is equal to '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn` remain unchanged. The first character in `s`, `i`, is still equal to '*'. However, the execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it was directly inside.
