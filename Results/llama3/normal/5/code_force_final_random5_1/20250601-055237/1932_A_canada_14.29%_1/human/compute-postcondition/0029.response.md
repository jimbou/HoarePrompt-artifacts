Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is the third character in the list. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `thorn` is 2, `thorn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0.***
