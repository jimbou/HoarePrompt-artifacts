Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is a list of characters that must have at least len characters, ret is 0, thorn is 0, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0 or 1, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is the first character in `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is the second character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is set to 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is the third character in `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is equal to 2, `thorn` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 or 1 and `thorn` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
