Output State: **`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the third character in `s`, and `thorn` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `len`, `s`, `ret`, `stdin`, `i`, and `thorn` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
