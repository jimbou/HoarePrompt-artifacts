The `print(ret)` statement will print the number of '@' characters in the list `s` before the first occurrence of a character that is not '@'.

Since `ret` is defined as the number of '@' characters in `s` before the first occurrence of a character that is not '@', the print statement will output this count.

Output: **the number of '@' characters in s before the first occurrence of a character that is not '@'**
