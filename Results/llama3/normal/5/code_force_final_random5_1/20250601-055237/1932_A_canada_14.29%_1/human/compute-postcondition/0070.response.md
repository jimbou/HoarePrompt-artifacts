To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. Since `len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, we can conclude that `s` must have at least 1 character for the loop to execute.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the first character in `s` during the first iteration.

State: **`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first character in `s`**
