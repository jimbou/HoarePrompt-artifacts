Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, the first character in the list `i` is '*', and `i` is not '@'. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
