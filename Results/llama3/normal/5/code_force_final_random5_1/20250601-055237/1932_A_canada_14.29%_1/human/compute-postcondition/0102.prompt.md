Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where each character is either '.', '@', or '*'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn == 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, and the value of `ret` which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in `s` before the first occurrence of ' and the number of '@' characters in `s` before the first occurrence of ' which is ret is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `thorn` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is the last character in `s` that was processed before the loop terminated, and the value of `ret` which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
