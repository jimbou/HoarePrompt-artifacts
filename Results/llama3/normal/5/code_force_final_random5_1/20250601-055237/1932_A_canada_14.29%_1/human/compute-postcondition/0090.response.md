Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is the second character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is set to 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` remains 0.***
