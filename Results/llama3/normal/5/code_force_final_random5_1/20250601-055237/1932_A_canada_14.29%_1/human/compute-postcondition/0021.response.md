Postcondition: **`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is the second character in the list. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` is 0.**
