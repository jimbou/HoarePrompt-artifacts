Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is the third character in `s`. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is equal to 2, `thorn` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
