Output State: **`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `thorn` is 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the second character in `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still the second character in the list `s`. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
