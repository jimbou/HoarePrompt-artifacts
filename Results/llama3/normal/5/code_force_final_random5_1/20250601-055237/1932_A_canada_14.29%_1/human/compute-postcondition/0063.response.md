Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is increased by 1, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.***
