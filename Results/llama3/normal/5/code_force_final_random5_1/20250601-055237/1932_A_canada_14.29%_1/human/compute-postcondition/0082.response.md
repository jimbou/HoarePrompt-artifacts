Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0 or 1, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is the first character in `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 0.***
