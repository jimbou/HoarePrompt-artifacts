Output State: **`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is the total number of '@' characters in all test cases before the first occurrence of '**' in each test case, `thorn` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is the last character in `s` that was processed before the loop terminated, and the value of `ret` which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, processing all test cases. The value of `ret` is the total count of '@' characters in all test cases before the first occurrence of '**' in each test case. The loop has terminated, and the last character processed in the last test case is stored in `i`. The input from `stdin` has been fully consumed, and no more input is available.
