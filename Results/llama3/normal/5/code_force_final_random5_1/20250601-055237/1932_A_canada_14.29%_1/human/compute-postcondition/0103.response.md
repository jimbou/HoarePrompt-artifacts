Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total count of '@' characters in each test case before the first occurrence of '**' or the end of the string, whichever comes first. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the result for each test case. The function iterates through each character in the input string, incrementing the count whenever it encounters an '@' character and resetting the count when it encounters a '**' sequence. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and the total count of '@' characters for each test case has been printed to stdout.**
