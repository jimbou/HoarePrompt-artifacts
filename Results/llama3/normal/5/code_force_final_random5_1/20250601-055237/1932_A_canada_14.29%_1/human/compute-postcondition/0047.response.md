Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If the first character `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0 and `i` is not '@'***
