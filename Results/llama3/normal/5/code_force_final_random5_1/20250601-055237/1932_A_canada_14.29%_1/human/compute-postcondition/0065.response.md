Output State: **`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in `s` before the first occurrence of '**' if it exists, otherwise `ret` is the number of '@' characters in `s`, `thorn` is 0 if '**' does not occur in `s`, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if '**' occurs in `s` but '***' does not occur, otherwise `thorn` is 2 if '***' occurs in `s`, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the length of the string `s` remains unchanged, the number of '@' characters in `s` is counted and stored in `ret`, the number of '*' characters in `s` is counted and stored in `thorn` until the first occurrence of '**' or '***' if they exist, and the number of test cases in `stdin` remains unchanged.
