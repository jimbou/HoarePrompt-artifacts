The code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison statement, not an assignment. It checks if the value of `thorn` is equal to 0, but it does not change the value of `thorn`.

Since the initial state already specifies that `thorn` is 0, this comparison statement does not have any effect on the program state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is the first character in the list, `i` is not '@', and `i` is not '*'**
