Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, and the first character in `s`, `i`, is equal to '*'. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
