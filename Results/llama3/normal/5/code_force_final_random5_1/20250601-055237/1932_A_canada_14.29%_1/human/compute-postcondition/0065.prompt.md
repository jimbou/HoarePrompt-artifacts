Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters, ret is 0, thorn is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character. If the first character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, and `i` is not '@'. In all cases, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0, `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1. If `thorn` is 2, `thorn` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0, `ret` is incremented by 1, and `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is increased by 1, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
