The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the expression `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
