Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list, `thorn` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `thorn` is 2, `thorn` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
