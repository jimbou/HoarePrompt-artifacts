Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, cnt is equal to the original value of cnt plus the sum of the integer division of (n - (i * i - i)) by (i * i) plus (i > 1) for all i from 1 to m-1, i is m-1, x is n - ((m-1) * (m-1) - (m-1)), y is (m-1) * (m-1)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `cnt` is updated to be the original value of `cnt` plus the sum of the integer division of `(n - (i * i - i))` by `(i * i)` plus `(i > 1)` for all `i` from 1 to `m-1`, `i` is `m-1`, `x` is `n - ((m-1) * (m-1) - (m-1))`, and `y` is `(m-1) * (m-1)`.
