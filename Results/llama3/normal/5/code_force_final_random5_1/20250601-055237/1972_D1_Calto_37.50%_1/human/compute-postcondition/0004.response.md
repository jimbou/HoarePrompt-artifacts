Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, cnt is equal to the original value of cnt plus the integer division of (n - (i * i - i)) by (i * i) plus 1 plus the integer division of (n - (i * i - i)) by (i * i) plus 1 plus (i > 1), i is 2, x is n - (i * i - i), y is i * i**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the integer division of `(n - (i * i - i))` by `(i * i)` plus 1, and then adding `(i > 1)`, which is equivalent to 1 since `i` is 2. The values of `x` and `y` are assigned the results of the expressions `n - (i * i - i)` and `i * i`, respectively.
