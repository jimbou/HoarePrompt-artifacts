Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is correct and works as expected.

`func_2` calculates the count of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. It iterates from 1 to m-1, performing integer division and addition operations. The logic of this function seems to be correct, but there is a potential issue.

The problem statement guarantees that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^6. However, the function `func_2` iterates up to m-1, which can be as large as 2 * 10^6. This can cause the function to exceed the maximum recursion depth or cause a timeout due to the large number of iterations.

To fix this issue, the function `func_2` should be optimized to reduce the number of iterations or use a more efficient algorithm.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the potential issue with the large number of iterations in `func_2`. However, the logic of the functions seems to be correct, and with optimization, the program can be made correct.
