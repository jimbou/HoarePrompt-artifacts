To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `m` remains the same, but we can infer that `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `n`, `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 3, `cnt` is equal to the original value of cnt plus the integer division of (n - (i * i - i)) by (i * i) plus 1 plus the integer division of (n - (i * i - i)) by (i * i) plus 1 plus (i > 1), `i` is 3, `x` is n - (i * i - i), `y` is i * i**
