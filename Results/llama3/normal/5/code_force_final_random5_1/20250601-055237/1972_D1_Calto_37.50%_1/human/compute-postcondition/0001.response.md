To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1. Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, we can adjust the state of `m` to be greater than 1.

The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head, so we can adjust its state to be 1.

The states of `n` and `cnt` are not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1**
