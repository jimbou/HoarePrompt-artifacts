To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, m):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `n` and `cnt` is not affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `cnt` is equal to the original value of `cnt` plus the integer division of `(n - (i * i - i))` by `(i * i)` plus 1, `i` is 2**
