Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for pairs (a, b) where b is less than or equal to the square root of n, and also only checks for pairs where a is less than or equal to n - (i * i - i). This is not sufficient to cover all possible pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

For example, consider the case where n = 10 and m = 8. The program will only check for pairs (a, b) where b is less than or equal to the square root of 10, which is 3. However, the pair (10, 8) also satisfies the conditions, but it is not checked by the program.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem and is incorrect.
