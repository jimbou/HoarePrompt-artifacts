The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `_` is 1, `a` is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, `x` is a list of 4 integers, `dx` is an integer, `stdin` contains 4t - 8 lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), and `dx` * `dx` is being printed**
