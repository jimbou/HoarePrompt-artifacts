To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 100.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `_` is now 2, `t` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, `x` is a list of 4 integers, `dx` is an integer, `stdin` is empty**
