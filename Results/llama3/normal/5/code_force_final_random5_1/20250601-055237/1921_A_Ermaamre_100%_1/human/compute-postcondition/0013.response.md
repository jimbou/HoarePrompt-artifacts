Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, _ is t-1, a is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x, stdin is empty, and the square of dx is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables within the loop have reached their final values. The loop counter `_` has reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The matrix `a` and the list `x` contain the last set of values read from the input. The variable `dx` contains the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the last set of `x` values. The input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed. Finally, the square of `dx` is being printed, which is the final output of the loop.
