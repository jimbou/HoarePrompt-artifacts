Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer greater than 2. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, still being 2. The value of `a` is updated to be a new 4x2 matrix containing integers, which are read from the input. The value of `x` is updated to be a list of 4 integers, which are the first elements of each row in the matrix `a`. The value of `dx` is updated to be an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. The input stream `stdin` is empty after the execution of the code.
