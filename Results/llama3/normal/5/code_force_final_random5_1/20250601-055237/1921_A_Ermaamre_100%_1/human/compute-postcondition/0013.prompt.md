Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
    x = [p[0] for p in a]
    dx = max(x) - min(x)
    print(dx * dx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 100, _ is 0, a is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer, stdin contains 4t - 4 lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), and dx * dx is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 100, _ is 1, a is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer, stdin is empty, and dx * dx which is the square of dx is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, a is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x, stdin is empty, and the square of dx is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
