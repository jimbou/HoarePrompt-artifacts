Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by 4t lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 100, _ is t-1, a is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x, stdin is empty, and the square of dx is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of square coordinates from standard input, calculates the side length of each square, and prints the area of each square. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the areas directly. The function processes a variable number of squares, as specified by the initial input, and leaves the standard input empty after processing.
