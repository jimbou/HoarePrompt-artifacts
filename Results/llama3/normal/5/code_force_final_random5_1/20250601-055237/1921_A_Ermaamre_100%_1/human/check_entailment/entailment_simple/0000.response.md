Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square correctly and stores them in a 4x2 matrix `a`.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates of the corners and stores them in a list `x`.
4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which represents the length of the side of the square (`dx`).
5. It prints the square of `dx`, which is the area of the square.

The program assumes that the input is valid, i.e., the coordinates of the corners form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. Under this assumption, the program correctly calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
