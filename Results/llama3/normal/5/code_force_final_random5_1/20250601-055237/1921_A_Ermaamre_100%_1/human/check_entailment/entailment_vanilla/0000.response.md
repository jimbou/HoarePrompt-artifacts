Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes.

2. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

3. It extracts the x-coordinates of the corners into a list `x`.

4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which represents the length of the side of the square (`dx`).

5. It calculates the area of the square by squaring the length of the side (`dx * dx`).

6. It prints the area of the square for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square based on the given coordinates of its corners. It takes into account the fact that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, which allows it to calculate the length of the side by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.

Correctness: **True**
