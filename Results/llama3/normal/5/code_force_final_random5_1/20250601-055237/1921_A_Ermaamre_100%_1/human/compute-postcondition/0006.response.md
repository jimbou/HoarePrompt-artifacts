Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100, _ is 1, a is a 4x2 matrix containing integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer, stdin is empty, and dx * dx is being printed.**

The code snippet first reads 4 lines from stdin, each containing two integers, and assigns them to the 4x2 matrix `a`. This empties stdin. Then, it extracts the first column of `a` into the list `x`. Finally, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` and assigns it to `dx`. The value of `dx` is then squared and printed. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
