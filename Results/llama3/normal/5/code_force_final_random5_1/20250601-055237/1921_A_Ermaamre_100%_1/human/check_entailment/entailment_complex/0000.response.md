Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, which is within the specified range of 1 to 100.
2. For each test case, the program reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square, which are guaranteed to have positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
3. The program correctly extracts the x-coordinates of the corners into a list `x`.
4. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which represents the side length of the square (`dx`).
5. The program correctly calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length (`dx * dx`).
6. The program prints the area of each square, which is the expected output.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. The execution states provided as comments also confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
