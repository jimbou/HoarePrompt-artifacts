Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (dx) and then squaring it. This is a valid approach because the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates represents the length of one side of the square.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square. It then calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description, such as the range of the coordinates (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) and the positive area of the square.
