The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `_` is 0,  `t` must be greater than 0**
