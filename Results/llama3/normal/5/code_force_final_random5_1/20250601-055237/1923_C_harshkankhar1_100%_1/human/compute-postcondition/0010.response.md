Output State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is n, q is at least 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of a[j] for j in range(1, n+1), b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if a[j] > 1 else 2 for j in range(1, n+1), x is an integer, y is an integer.**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin, assigns them to x and y, and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison of the differences between elements of lists a and b. The values of t, i, q, a, and b remain unchanged. The only new information is the values of x and y, which are integers.
