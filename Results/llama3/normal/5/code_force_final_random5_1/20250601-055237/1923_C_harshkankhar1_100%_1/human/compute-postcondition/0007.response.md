Output State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if a[j] > 1 else 2 for j in range(1, n+1)**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the list `b` will contain the cumulative sums of 1 if the corresponding element in list `a` is greater than 1, otherwise 2, starting from the second element to the `n`-th element. The other variables `t`, `stdin`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.
