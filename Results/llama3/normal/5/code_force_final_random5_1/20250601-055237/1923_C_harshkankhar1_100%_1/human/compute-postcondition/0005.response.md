The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be at least 3.
State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is at least 3, i is 3, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, and the remaining elements are zeros except for the third element which is the sum of the second element and 1 if a[2] > 1 else 2.**
