Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given subarray is good according to the problem description. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `a` and the cumulative sum of the array `b` (which is calculated based on the values in `a`). Then, for each query, it checks if the cumulative sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the cumulative sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. If it is, the program prints 'NO', indicating that the subarray is not good. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element (i.e., `x == y`). In this case, the program prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good according to the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example.

Correctness: **True**
