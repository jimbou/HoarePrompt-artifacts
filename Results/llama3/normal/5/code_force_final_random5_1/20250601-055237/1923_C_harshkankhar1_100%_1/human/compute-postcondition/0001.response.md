To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is reduced by 1, and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1 and `i` to be 1.

State: **`t` is reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` zeros**
