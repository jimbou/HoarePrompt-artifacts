Output State: **`t` is reduced by 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n`, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of `a[j]` for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if `a[j] > 1` else 2 for `j` in range(1, `n+1`).**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the cumulative sum of its original elements. The first element of `a` is still 0, and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the original elements. For example, if the original `a` was `[0, 3, 2, 4]`, the new `a` would be `[0, 3, 5, 9]`. The values of `t`, `i`, `q`, and `b` remain unchanged.
