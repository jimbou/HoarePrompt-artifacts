The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time q must be at least 1. However, the loop counter _ is increased by 1 after each iteration. So for the loop to execute again q must be at least 2.
State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is n, q is at least 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of a[j] for j in range(1, n+1), b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if a[j] > 1 else 2 for j in range(1, n+1), x is an integer, y is an integer.**
