To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is reduced by 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n`, `q` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of `a[j]` for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if `a[j] > 1` else 2 for `j` in range(1, `n+1`).**
