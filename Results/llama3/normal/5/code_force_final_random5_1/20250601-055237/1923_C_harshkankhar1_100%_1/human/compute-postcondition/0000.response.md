Output State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q, followed by n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, followed by q pairs of integers l_i and r_i. n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 zeros.**

In this output state, the value of t is reduced by 1 because one test case has been processed. The remaining test cases are still in stdin. The variables n and q have been assigned the values of the two integers in the current test case. The list a has been created with n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n. The list b has been created with n+1 zeros.
