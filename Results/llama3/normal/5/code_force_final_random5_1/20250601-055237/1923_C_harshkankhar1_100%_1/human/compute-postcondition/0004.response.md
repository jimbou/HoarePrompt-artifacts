Output State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is at least 2, i is 2, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, and the remaining elements are zeros except for the third element which is the sum of the second element and 1 if a[2] > 1 else 2.**

The code assigns the value of 1 to `x` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise it assigns the value of 2. Since `i` is 2, this means that `x` will be 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise it will be 2. Then, the code assigns the sum of `b[i - 1]` and `x` to `b[i]`. Since `i` is 2, this means that `b[2]` will be the sum of `b[1]` and `x`. The value of `b[1]` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise it is 2. Therefore, `b[2]` will be 2 if `a[1]` is greater than 1 and `a[2]` is greater than 1, 3 if `a[1]` is greater than 1 and `a[2]` is not greater than 1, 3 if `a[1]` is not greater than 1 and `a[2]` is greater than 1, or 4 if `a[1]` is not greater than 1 and `a[2]` is not greater than 1.
