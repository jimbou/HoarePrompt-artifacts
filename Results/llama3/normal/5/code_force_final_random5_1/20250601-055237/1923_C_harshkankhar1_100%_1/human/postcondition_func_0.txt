This function reads input from stdin, processes test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query. It takes no parameters and returns no values. The function's purpose is to determine whether a given range of integers in a list has a cumulative sum less than the cumulative sum of a calculated value (1 if the integer is greater than 1, otherwise 2) for the same range. The function processes all test cases and queries, printing the results for each query.
