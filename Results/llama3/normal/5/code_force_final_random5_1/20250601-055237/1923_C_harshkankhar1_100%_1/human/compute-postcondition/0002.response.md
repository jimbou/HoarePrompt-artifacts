Output State: **t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is at least 1, i is 1, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, and the remaining elements are zeros**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been reduced by 1, and there are `t-1` test cases remaining in `stdin`. The value of `n` remains at least 1, and `i` is still 1. The value of `q` remains a positive integer. The list `a` remains unchanged, with the first element being 0 and the remaining elements being the `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`. The list `b` has been modified, with the first element being 0, the second element being 1 if `a[1] > 1` else 2, and the remaining elements being zeros.
