Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q, followed by n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, followed by q pairs of integers l_i and r_i. n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
    b[i] = b[i - 1] + x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is at least 1, i is 1, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, and the remaining elements are zeros

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is at least 2, i is 2, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, and the remaining elements are zeros except for the third element which is the sum of the second element and 1 if a[2] > 1 else 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is at least 3, i is 3, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, and the remaining elements are zeros except for the third element which is the sum of the second element and 1 if a[2] > 1 else 2, and the third element of b is updated to be the sum of the second element and 1 if a[3] > 1 else 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
