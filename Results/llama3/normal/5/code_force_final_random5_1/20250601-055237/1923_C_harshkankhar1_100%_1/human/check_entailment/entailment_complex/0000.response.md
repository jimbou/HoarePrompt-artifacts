Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given subarray is "good" based on the conditions provided. The program uses two lists, `a` and `b`, to store the cumulative sums of the input array `c` and the calculated values (1 if the integer is greater than 1, otherwise 2), respectively.

The program correctly calculates the cumulative sums for both lists and then iterates over the queries. For each query, it checks if the cumulative sum of the subarray is less than the cumulative sum of the calculated values for the same range. If it is, the program prints "NO", indicating that the subarray is not "good". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The program handles the edge case where the query range has only one element (`x == y`) by printing "NO" in this case, as the problem statement requires that `a_i â‰  b_i` for every index `i`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example.

Correctness: **True**
