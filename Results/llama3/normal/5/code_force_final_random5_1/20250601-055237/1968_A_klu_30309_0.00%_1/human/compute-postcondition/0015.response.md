Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, y is 2, max_val is the largest divisor of x that is less than x/2.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of x remains unchanged, the value of y is set to 2 (the smallest possible value in the range), and the value of max_val is set to the largest divisor of x that is less than x/2.
