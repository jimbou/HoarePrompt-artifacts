The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is x - 2. For the loop to execute again, y must be x - 3.
State: **`x` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is `x - 3`, `max_val` is 1**
