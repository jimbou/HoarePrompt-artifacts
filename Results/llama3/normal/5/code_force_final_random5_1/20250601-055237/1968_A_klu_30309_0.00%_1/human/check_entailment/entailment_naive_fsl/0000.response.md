Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to find an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The function func_1(x) iterates over the range from x-1 to 1 in reverse order and checks if x is divisible by y. If x is divisible by y and 2*y is greater than or equal to x, it returns y. Otherwise, it keeps track of the maximum y found so far.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It checks all possible values of y in the range from x-1 to 1 and returns the first y that satisfies the condition gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The condition 2*y >= x is used to ensure that y is the maximum possible value.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and returns the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
