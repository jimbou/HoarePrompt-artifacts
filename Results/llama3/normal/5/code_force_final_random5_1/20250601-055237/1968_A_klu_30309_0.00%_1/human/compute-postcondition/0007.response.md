To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the values of `y` starting from `x - 1` and decreasing by 1 until it reaches 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 1`, and `max_val` is 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `y`. Since the loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `y` will be `y - 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 2`, `max_val` is 1**

Note that we didn't change the state of `x` or `max_val` because they are not involved in the loop head. Only the state of `y` is adjusted according to the loop's decrement operation.
