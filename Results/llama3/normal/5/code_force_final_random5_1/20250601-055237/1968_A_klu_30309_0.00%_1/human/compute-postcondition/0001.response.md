To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `x`, and the range parameters.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 1, since the range starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

Since `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, we can conclude that `x` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Additionally, `y` will take on the value of `x - 1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 1`, `max_val` is 1**
