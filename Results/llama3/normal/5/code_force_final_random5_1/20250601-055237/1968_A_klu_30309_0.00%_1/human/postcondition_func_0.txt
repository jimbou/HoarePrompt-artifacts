This function finds the largest divisor of a given integer x that is less than x/2, where x is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). It returns this largest divisor. If a divisor y is found such that 2*y is greater than or equal to x, it returns y immediately. Otherwise, it iterates through possible divisors in descending order and returns the largest one that is less than x/2.
