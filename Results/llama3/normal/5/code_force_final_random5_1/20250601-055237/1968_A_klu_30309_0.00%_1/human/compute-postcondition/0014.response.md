Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is `x - 3`, `max_val` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `y` and 2 times `y` is larger or equal to `x`, the function returns `y` which is an integer between 0 and 997 (inclusive), and is equal to `x - 3`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, and `max_val`.***
