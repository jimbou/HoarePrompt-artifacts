Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, max_val is 1
Code of the loop:
for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
    if x % y == 0:
        if 2 * y >= x:
            return y
        max_val = y


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 1`, `max_val` is 1. If `x` is a multiple of `y` and 2 * y is strictly less than `x`, then the current value of `x` is a multiple of `y`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is `x - 2`, `max_val` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `y` and 2 times `y` is larger or equal to `x`, the function returns `y` that is 2 less than `x`. Otherwise, no change is made to `x`, `y`, or `max_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is `x - 3`, `max_val` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `y` and 2 times `y` is larger or equal to `x`, the function returns `y` which is an integer between 0 and 997 (inclusive), and is equal to `x - 3`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, and `max_val`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
