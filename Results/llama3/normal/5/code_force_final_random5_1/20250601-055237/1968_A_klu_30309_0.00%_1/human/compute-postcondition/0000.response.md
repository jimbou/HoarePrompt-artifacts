Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, max_val is 1**

The code snippet provided does not modify the value of `x`, as it only defines a function and initializes a variable `max_val` to 1. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and since it was initially an integer between 2 and 1000, it still holds this property. The variable `max_val` is introduced and set to 1, which is the only change made by the code.
