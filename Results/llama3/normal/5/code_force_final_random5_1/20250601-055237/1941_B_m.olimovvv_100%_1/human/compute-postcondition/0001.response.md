The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases, `a` becomes the value of `t`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `b`. Since stdin contains `t` test cases after the integer `t`, `b` becomes a list of `t` integers.

The variable `_` is not affected by the code and remains 0.

Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, b is a list of t integers, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
