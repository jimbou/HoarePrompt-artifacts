Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operations described in the problem statement and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using these operations.

The program works by iterating over the array from left to right, and for each element, it subtracts twice the current element from the next element and subtracts the current element from the element after that. This is equivalent to applying the operation described in the problem statement.

After performing these operations for all elements, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it means that all elements of the array can be made equal to zero using the described operations, so the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array has less than three elements, in which case it's not possible to make all elements equal to zero using the described operations.

Correctness: **True**
