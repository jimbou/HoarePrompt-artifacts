To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `a - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is an integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `a` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `a` must still be greater than 2 + 2, which means `a` must be greater than 4.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is a list of integers with `b[i]` equal to 0, `b[i + 1]` decreased by twice the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` decreased by the original value of `b[i]`, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.**
