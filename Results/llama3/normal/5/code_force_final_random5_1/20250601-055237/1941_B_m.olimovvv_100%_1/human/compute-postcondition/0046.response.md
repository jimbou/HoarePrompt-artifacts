Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of t integers, _ is 2, i is a - 3, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the value of `a` is an integer read from the input, replacing its original value of at least 4. The list `b` now contains `t` integers read from the input, replacing its original values. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 2. The variable `i` also remains unchanged with a value of `a - 3`. Since `b[i]` was originally 0, its value remains 0. The value of `b[i + 1]` is decreased by three times the original value of `b[0]` minus twice the original value of `b[i]`, but since `b[i]` is 0, this simplifies to three times the original value of `b[0]`. Similarly, the value of `b[i + 2]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[0]` minus the original value of `b[i]`, which simplifies to twice the original value of `b[0]`. The stdin is now empty after reading the input for `a` and `b`.
