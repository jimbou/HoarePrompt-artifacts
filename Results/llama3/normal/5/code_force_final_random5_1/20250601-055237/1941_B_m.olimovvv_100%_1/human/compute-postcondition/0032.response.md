To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, a - 2):`. The variables involved are `i` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The value of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, `b[i]` is the original value of `b[0]` (which is now 0), `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[0]`, and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the original value of `b[0]`. Either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.**
