To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, a - 2):`. The objects involved are `i` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is an integer greater than 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The loop condition is `i < a - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must still be greater than 4, and `i` must be less than `a - 2`. Since `i` is now 2, `a` must be greater than 4.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is a list of integers with `b[i]` equal to 0, `b[i + 1]` decreased by three times the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` decreased by the original value of `b[i]`, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, and `stdin` is empty.**
