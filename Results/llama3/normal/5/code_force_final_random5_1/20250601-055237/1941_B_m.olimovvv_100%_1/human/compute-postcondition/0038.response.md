To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(0, a - 2):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `a` is at least 3
* `b` is a list of t integers
* `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the loop head, so we can ignore it)
* `i` is 1
* `b[i]` is 0
* `b[i + 1]` is decreased by three times the original value of `b[0]`
* `b[i + 2]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[0]`

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `a`. Since `i` is currently 1, we increment it by 1 to make it 2. For the loop to execute again, `a` must still be at least 3, but since `i` is now 2, we need to ensure that `a` is at least 4 (because `i` will be compared to `a - 2` in the loop condition).

The other variables (`b`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, and `b[i + 2]`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

State: **`a` is at least 4, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by three times the original value of `b[0]`, and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[0]`**
