Output State: **a is at least 4, b is a list of t integers, _ is 1, i is a - 3, b[i] is 0, b[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of b[0] minus twice the original value of b[i], and b[i + 2] is decreased by twice the original value of b[0] minus the original value of b[i]. Either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that 'a' is at least 4, 'b' is a list of 't' integers, '_' is 1, 'i' is 'a - 3', 'b[i]' is 0, 'b[i + 1]' is decreased by three times the original value of 'b[0]' minus twice the original value of 'b[i]', and 'b[i + 2]' is decreased by twice the original value of 'b[0]' minus the original value of 'b[i]'. Either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.
