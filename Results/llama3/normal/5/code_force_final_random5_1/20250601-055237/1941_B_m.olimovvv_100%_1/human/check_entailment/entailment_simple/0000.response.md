Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `a` and the array `b`.
2. It then iterates over the array from the first element to the third last element (inclusive). For each element `b[i]`, it subtracts `2*b[i]` from the next element `b[i+1]` and `b[i]` from the element after that `b[i+2]`. This simulates the operation described in the problem.
3. If at any point `b[i]` becomes negative, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop, because it's not possible to make all elements zero.
4. After the loop, it checks if the last two elements `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both zero. If they are not, it prints "NO", because it's not possible to make all elements zero. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The program's logic is correct because it correctly simulates the operations described in the problem and checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.

Correctness: **True**
