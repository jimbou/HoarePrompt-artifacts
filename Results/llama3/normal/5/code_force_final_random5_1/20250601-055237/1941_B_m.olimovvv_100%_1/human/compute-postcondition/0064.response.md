Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is a list of integers with `b[i]` equal to 0, `b[i + 1]` decreased by three times the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` decreased by the original value of `b[i]`, `_` is 2, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
