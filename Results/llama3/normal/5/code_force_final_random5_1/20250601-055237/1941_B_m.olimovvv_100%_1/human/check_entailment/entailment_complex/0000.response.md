Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operations described in the problem statement and checks if all elements of the array can be made zero using these operations.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the elements of the array `b`. It then iterates over the array from the first element to the second last element, performing the operations described in the problem statement. If at any point an element becomes negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding any negative elements, it checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the input array has only three elements, and it correctly checks if all elements can be made zero using the described operations.

Correctness: **True**
