The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases and _ is 0 and input is the first integer t.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, _ is 0, input is the first integer t**
