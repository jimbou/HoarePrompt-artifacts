Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i]` is 0, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is still greater than 3, the list `b` still contains t integers, the variable `_` remains 0, the variable `i` is still 1, the value of `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, the value of `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`, the value of `b[i]` is 0, and 'NO' is printed. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
