Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `b[i]` is less than 0, and 'NO' is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The break statement only affects the control flow of the program, causing it to exit the innermost loop or if statement. The current value of `b[i]` is still less than 0, and the message 'NO' is still being printed.
