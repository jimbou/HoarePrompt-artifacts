To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `int(input())` is unknown but must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `b` is a list of t integers where `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.**
