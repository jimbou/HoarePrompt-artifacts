Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 4, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by three times the original value of `b[0]`, and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[0]`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
