Output State: **a is at least 3, b is a list of t integers, _ is 1, i is 0, b[i + 1] is decreased by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of b[i], and b[i] is now 0. Either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `b` is modified at indices `i`, `i + 1`, and `i + 2`. The value at index `i` is set to 0, the value at index `i + 1` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[i]`, and the value at index `i + 2` is decreased by the original value of `b[i]`. The variable `_` remains 1, and `i` remains 0. Additionally, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, depending on the condition in the initial state.
