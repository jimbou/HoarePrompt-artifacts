The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If a is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is an integer, b is a list of t integers, _ is 2, i is a - 3, stdin is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than 2 and i is now 0. 
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, stdin is empty**
