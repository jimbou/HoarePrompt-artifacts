The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `a` must be greater than 3.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i]` is 0**
