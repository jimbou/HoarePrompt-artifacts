Output State: **a is an integer greater than 3, b is a list of t integers, _ is 0, i is 1, b[i + 1] is reduced by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of b[i], b[i] is 0. If b[i] was negative, 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The list `b` is modified according to the given operations: `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`. Additionally, `b[i]` is set to 0. If the original value of `b[i]` was negative, the string 'NO' is printed. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged.
