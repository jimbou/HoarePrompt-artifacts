Output State: **a is 0, b is a list of t integers with b[i] equal to 0, b[i + 1] decreased by (a - 1) times the original value of b[i], and b[i + 2] decreased by the original value of b[i], _ is t, i is a - 1, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 'a' will be 0, the list 'b' will have all its elements decreased by a certain amount based on the original values of 'b[i]', 'b[i + 1]', and 'b[i + 2]', the variable '_' will be equal to the number of test cases 't', the variable 'i' will be equal to 'a - 1', and the standard input 'stdin' will be empty.
