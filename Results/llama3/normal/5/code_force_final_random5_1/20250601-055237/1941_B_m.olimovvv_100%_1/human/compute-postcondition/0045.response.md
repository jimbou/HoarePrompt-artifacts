To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_`. If `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.

State: **`a` is at least 4, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 2, `i` is a - 3, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by three times the original value of `b[0]` minus twice the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[0]` minus the original value of `b[i]`. Either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.**
