Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation allows Rudolf to choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and assign:

* a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1
* a_i = a_i - 2
* a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1

However, the program implements the operation as:

* b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
* b[i + 2] -= b[i]
* b[i] -= b[i]

This is not equivalent to the original operation. For example, if the input array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2], the program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because Rudolf can make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The correct implementation of the operation should be:

* b[i - 1] -= 1
* b[i] -= 2
* b[i + 1] -= 1

The program also does not correctly handle the case when the input array has less than 3 elements. The problem statement guarantees that the input array will have at least 3 elements, but the program does not check for this condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
