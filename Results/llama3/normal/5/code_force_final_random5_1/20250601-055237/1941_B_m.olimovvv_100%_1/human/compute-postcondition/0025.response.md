To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is at least 3, because the range starts from 0 and goes up to `a - 2`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to be at least 3.

State: **`a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of t integers, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, `i` is 0**
