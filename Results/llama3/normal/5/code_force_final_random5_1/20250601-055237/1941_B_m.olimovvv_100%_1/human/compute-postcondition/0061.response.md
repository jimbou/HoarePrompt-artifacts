Based on the initial state, the code snippet, and the task, I will determine exactly what will be printed when the statement executes.

The code snippet is a simple print statement that prints the string 'NO'.

There are no variables or objects being printed, and the print statement does not depend on any conditions or formulas. Therefore, the output will be exactly as written in the code.

Output: **NO**
