The code prints the value of `count` plus `x` minus 2. 

Since `count` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2 plus 1, when `num` equals 1, and `x` is `i + 1`, where `i` is `x - 1`, we can substitute `i` with `x - 1` in the expression `x - 2` to get `i - 1`. 

Therefore, the code prints the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2 plus 1, when `num` equals 1, plus `i - 1`, where `i` is `x - 1`.

Output: **count (the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1, when num equals 1) + i - 1 (where i is x - 1)**
