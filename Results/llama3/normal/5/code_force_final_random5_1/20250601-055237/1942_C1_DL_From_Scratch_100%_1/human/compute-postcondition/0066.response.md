Output: **T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1. If num is equal to 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1. Otherwise, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2. The value of count plus x minus 2 is being printed**
