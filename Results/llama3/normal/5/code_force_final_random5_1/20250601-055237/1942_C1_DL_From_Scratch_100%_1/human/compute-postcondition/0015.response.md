Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than `i + 2`, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is increased by 1, `num` is an integer equal to the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in `list0`, minus 1. If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1.***
