The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T. If T is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, T must be decreased by 1.
State: **T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2, and num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1**
