Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers. If the difference between the third element of `list0` and the second element of `list0` minus 1 is 1, then `count` is 2 (if the difference between the second element of `list0` and the first element of `list0` is 2). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
