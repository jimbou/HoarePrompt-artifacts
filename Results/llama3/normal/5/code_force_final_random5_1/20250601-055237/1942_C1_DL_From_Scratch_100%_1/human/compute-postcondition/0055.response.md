Postcondition: ***T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is 1, and num is the difference between the second and the first element of list0 minus 1. If the difference between the first two elements of list0 is 2, count is 2. Otherwise, count is 1.***
