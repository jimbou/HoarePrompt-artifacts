Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers. If the difference between the second element of `list0` and the first element of `list0` is 2, then `count` is 1 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `count` and `i` remain unchanged.***
