Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, and the difference between the second element of `list0` and the first element of `list0` is 2, so the current value of `num` is 1.**
