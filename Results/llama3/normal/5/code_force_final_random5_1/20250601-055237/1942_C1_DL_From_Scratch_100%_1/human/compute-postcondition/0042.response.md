Postcondition: ***T is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2, and num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1. If num is equal to 1, then count is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
