Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be at least 3, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `num` is the difference between the third and the second element of `list0` minus 1. If `num` is 1, then if the difference between the second and the first element of `list0` is 2, `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2. If `num` is not 1, then if the difference between the second and the first element of `list0` is 2, `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.***
