Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `list0` minus 1 equals 1, then `count` is 2 if the difference between the second and first elements of `list0` is 2, otherwise `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 1 if the difference between the second and first elements of `list0` is 2, otherwise `count` is 0.***
