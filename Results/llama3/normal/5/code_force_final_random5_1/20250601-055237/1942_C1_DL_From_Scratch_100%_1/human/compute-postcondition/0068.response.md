Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then sorts the list of integers and counts the number of pairs of adjacent elements that have a difference of 2. If the first or last element in the sorted list has a difference of 1 with the start or end of the range [1, n], respectively, it increments the count by 1. Finally, the function prints the count plus x minus 2 for each test case.**
