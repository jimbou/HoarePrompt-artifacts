Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1. If num equals 1, count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: count + x - 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2, and num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1. If num is equal to 1, then count is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the value of count + x - 2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1. If num is equal to 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1. Otherwise, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2. The value of count plus x minus 2 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
