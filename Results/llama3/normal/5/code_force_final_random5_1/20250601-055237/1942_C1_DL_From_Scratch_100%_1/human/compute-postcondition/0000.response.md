Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the variable `T` is assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The remaining test cases still consist of two lines each, with the first line containing three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line containing x distinct integers from 1 to n.
