Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, count is 0, and num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x - 1):
    num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 1, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is 0, and count is 1 if the difference between the first two elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is 1, and num is the difference between the second and the first element of list0 minus 1. If the difference between the first two elements of list0 is 2, count is 2. Otherwise, count is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be at least 3, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `num` is the difference between the third and the second element of `list0` minus 1. If `num` is 1, then if the difference between the second and the first element of `list0` is 2, `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2. If `num` is not 1, then if the difference between the second and the first element of `list0` is 2, `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
