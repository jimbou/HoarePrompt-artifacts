To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `T` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need a specific value, but its presence indicates the loop will execute).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0.

State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0**
