Postcondition: ***T is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1. If num equals 1, count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
