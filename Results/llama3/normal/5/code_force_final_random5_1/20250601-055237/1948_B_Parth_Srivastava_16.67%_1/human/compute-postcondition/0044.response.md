Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, c is a list containing the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 1, x is the last digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, i is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `a` also remains unchanged, but its length is still at least 3. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. A new list `c` is created, containing the integer at index `i` in `a`. The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to be the last and first digits of the integer at index `i+1` in `a`, respectively. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1.
