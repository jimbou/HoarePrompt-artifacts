Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 3 or 4, and c is a list with at least four or five elements. Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3, and c is a list with at least three or four elements.***
