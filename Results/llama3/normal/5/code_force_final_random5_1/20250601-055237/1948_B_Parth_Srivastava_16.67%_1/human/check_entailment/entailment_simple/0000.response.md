Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.

2. For each test case, the program reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself. It then initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c`.

3. The program then iterates over the array `a`. If an element is greater than 10, it extracts the digits of the element and checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. If they are, it appends the digits to the list `c`. If not, it appends the original element to `c`.

4. After processing all elements in the array, the program sorts the list `c` and checks if it is equal to the original list `c`. If they are equal, it means the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order, so it appends 1 to the list `b`. Otherwise, it appends 0 to `b`.

5. Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in `b` is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the array is already sorted, when the array can be made sorted by splitting elements, and when the array cannot be made sorted.

Correctness: **True**
