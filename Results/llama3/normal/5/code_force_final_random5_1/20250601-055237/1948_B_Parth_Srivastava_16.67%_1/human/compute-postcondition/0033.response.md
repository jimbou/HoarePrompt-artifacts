Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is increased by 1, c is a list with at least three or four elements, n is either 2 or 3.**

In this output state, the value of k remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list a also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is decreased by 1 as one test case is processed. The value of i is increased by 1 as it is incremented in the code. The list c now contains at least three or four elements as one element is appended to it. The value of n is either 2 or 3 as it is incremented by 1.
