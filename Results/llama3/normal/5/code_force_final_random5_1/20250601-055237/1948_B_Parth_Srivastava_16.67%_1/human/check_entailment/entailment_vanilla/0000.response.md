Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.

2. The program then defines a function `func_1()` that reads the input for each test case, processes the input, and appends the result to the list `b`.

3. Inside the `func_1()` function, the program reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.

4. The program then initializes several variables: `x` and `y` to store the digits of a number, `n` to keep track of the length of the modified array, and `c` to store the modified array.

5. The program then iterates over the input array `a`. If an element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it extracts the digits `x` and `y` and checks if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in the modified array `c`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`. Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.

6. If the element is the first element and greater than 10, it extracts the digits `x` and `y` and checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`. Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.

7. If the element is less than or equal to 10, it simply appends the element to `c`.

8. After processing all elements, the program sorts the modified array `c` and checks if it is equal to the original modified array. If they are equal, it means the array can be sorted in non-descending order, so it appends 1 to the list `b`. Otherwise, it appends 0 to `b`.

9. Finally, the program iterates over the list `b` and prints 'YES' if the corresponding element is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
