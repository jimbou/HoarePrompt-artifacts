Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a, i is increased by 1.**

The code snippet assigns the last digit of the integer at index i in list a to x and the first digit of the integer at index i in list a to y. The value of i is increased by 1. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
