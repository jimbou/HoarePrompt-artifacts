Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a, i is increased by 1. If y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, then if y is less than or equal to x, c is a list containing the first digit and last digit of the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 2. Otherwise, stdin contains t-2 test cases, c is a list containing the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 1, x is the last digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i+1 in a.***
