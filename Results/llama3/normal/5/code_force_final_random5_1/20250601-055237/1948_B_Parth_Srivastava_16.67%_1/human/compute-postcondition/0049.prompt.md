Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, n is 0, c is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a, n is either 1 or 2, and c is a list with at least two or three elements. If y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, then if y is less than or equal to x, then the last element of c is x, n is 2, and the current value of y is greater than or equal to the second last element of c. Otherwise, y is greater than x, n is 1, and the current value of y is greater than or equal to the last element of c. If a[i] is not greater than 10 or i is 0, then if i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 1 or 2, and c is a list containing either one or two elements: the first digit of a[i] and/or the last digit of a[i]. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2 and c contains both the first and last digits of a[i]. If y is greater than x, then n is 1 and c contains only the first digit of a[i]. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, and c is a list containing a single integer which is the first element of a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a. If y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, then if y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 3 or 4, and c is a list with at least four or five elements. Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3, and c is a list with at least three or four elements. If a[i] is not greater than 10 or i is 0, then if i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, and c is a list containing either one, two, three, four or five elements: the first digit of a[i], the last digit of a[i], and/or the first digit of a[i] and/or the last digit of a[i]. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 2 or 4 and c contains both the first and last digits of a[i]. If y is greater than x, then n is either 1 or 3 and c contains only the first digit of a[i]. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is either 1, 2 or 3, and c is a list containing either a single integer which is the first element of a or two integers which are the first element of a and the first element of a. Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3 and c is a list with at least three or four elements. i is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a. If y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, then if y is less than or equal to x, c is a list containing the first digit and last digit of the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 2. Otherwise, c is a list containing the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 1, x is the last digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i+1 in a. If a[i] is not greater than 10 or i is 0, then if i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then if the first digit of the integer at index i in a is less than or equal to the last digit of the integer at index i in a, then c is a list that contains the first digit of the integer at index i in a and the last digit of the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 2. Otherwise, c is a list containing the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 1. In both cases, x is the last digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, and i is increased by 1. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then c is a list with at least one more element than before, and n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4. In all cases, i is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
