Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is increased by 1. If i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, and c is a list containing either one, two, three, four or five elements: the first digit of a[i], the last digit of a[i], and/or the first digit of a[i] and/or the last digit of a[i]. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 2 or 4 and c contains both the first and last digits of a[i]. If y is greater than x, then n is either 1 or 3 and c contains only the first digit of a[i]. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is either 1, 2 or 3, and c is a list containing either a single integer which is the first element of a or two integers which are the first element of a and the first element of a. Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3 and c is a list with at least three or four elements.***
