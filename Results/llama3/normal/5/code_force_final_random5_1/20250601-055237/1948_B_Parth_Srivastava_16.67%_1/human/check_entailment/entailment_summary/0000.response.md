Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible cases. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results.
2. For each test case, the program calls the function `func_1()`, which reads the length of the array `k` and the array elements `a`.
3. The function `func_1()` processes the array elements by splitting any two-digit numbers into their tens and units digits if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit. This is done to simulate the operation described in the problem.
4. The processed integers are stored in a list `c`.
5. The function then checks if the list `c` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. If `c` is sorted, the function appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.
6. After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in list `b` is 1, indicating that the array can be sorted using the described operation; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

* Two-digit numbers with tens digit less than or equal to units digit are split correctly.
* Two-digit numbers with tens digit greater than units digit are left unchanged.
* Single-digit numbers are left unchanged.
* The program correctly checks if the processed array is sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will match the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
