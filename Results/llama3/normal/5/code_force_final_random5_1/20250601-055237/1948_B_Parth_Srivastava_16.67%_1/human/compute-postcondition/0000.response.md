The code reads the first line of a test case from stdin, which contains a single integer k, and assigns it to the variable k. The second line of the test case, containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, is read and split into a list of integers, which is assigned to the variable a. The variables x, y, and n are initialized to 0, and an empty list c is created.

Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, n is 0, c is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
