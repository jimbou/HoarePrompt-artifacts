Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing one element which is 0, `b` is a list containing one element which is 0, stdin contains t test cases, `c` is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `n` is equal to the length of `c`, `d` is a sorted list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), and `c` is not equal to `d`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` remains the same, `a` is still an empty list, `b` now contains a single element which is 0, the number of test cases in stdin remains the same, the values of `c`, `n`, and `d` are unchanged, and the condition that `c` is not equal to `d` still holds.
