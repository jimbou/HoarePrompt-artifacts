Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is an empty list, stdin contains t test cases, c is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), n is equal to the length of c, d is a sorted list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive)**

In this output state, the value of d is a sorted list of the same integers that are in c, in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
