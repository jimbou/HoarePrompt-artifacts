Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 integers, c is a list containing the first digit and last digit of the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a, i is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of k remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list a also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list c is updated to include the first digit and last digit of the integer at index i in a. The value of n is increased by 2. The stdin remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of x and y are updated to be the last digit and first digit of the integer at index i in a, respectively. The value of i is increased by 1.
