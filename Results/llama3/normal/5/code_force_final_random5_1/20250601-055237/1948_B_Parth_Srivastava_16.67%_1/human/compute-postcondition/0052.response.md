Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list with one element which is 1, stdin contains t test cases, `c` is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `n` is equal to the length of `c`, `d` is a sorted list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), and the current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `d`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` remains the same, an integer between 2 and 50. The list `a` now contains one element, which is 1. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same. The lists `c` and `d` remain unchanged, with `c` being a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99, and `d` being a sorted list of the same integers. The length of `c` is still equal to `n`.
