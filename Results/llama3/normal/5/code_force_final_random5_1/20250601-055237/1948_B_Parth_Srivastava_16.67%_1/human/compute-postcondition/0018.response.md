Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 1 or 2, c is a list containing either one or two elements: the first digit of a[i] and/or the last digit of a[i], stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2 and c contains both the first and last digits of a[i]. If y is greater than x, then n is 1 and c contains only the first digit of a[i].***
