Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 integer, x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, c is a list containing a single integer which is the first element of a, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0, and either a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is not 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been incremented by 1, and the first element of list `a` has been appended to list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
