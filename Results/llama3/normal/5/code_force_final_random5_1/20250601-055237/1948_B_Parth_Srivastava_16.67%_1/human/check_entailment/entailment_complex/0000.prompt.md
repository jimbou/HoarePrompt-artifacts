Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

# Annotated Program:

b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
        
    #State: k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is an empty list, stdin contains t test cases. c is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), n is equal to the length of c.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: *k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list with one element, stdin contains t test cases, c is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), n is equal to the length of c, d is a sorted list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If c is equal to d, then a contains 1. Otherwise, a contains 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then processes these integers, splitting any two-digit numbers into their tens and units digits if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit, and otherwise leaving the number unchanged. The processed integers are stored in a list. The function then checks if the list of processed integers is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, the function appends 1 to a list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function returns the list b, which contains 1 if the processed integers are sorted and 0 otherwise.
