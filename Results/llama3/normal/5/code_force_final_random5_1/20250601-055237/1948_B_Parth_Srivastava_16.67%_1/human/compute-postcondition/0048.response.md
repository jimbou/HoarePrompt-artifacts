Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a. If y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, then if y is less than or equal to x, c is a list containing the first digit and last digit of the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 2. Otherwise, c is a list containing the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 1, x is the last digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i+1 in a. If a[i] is not greater than 10 or i is 0, then if i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then if the first digit of the integer at index i in a is less than or equal to the last digit of the integer at index i in a, then c is a list that contains the first digit of the integer at index i in a and the last digit of the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 2. Otherwise, c is a list containing the integer at index i in a, n is increased by 1. In both cases, x is the last digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i+1 in a, and i is increased by 1. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then c is a list with at least one more element than before, and n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4. In all cases, i is increased by 1.***
