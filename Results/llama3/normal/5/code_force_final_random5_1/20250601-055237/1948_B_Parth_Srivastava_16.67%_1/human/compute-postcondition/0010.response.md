Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a, n is either 1 or 2, c is a list with at least two or three elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is the index of an element in a that is greater than 10. If y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, then if y is less than or equal to x, then the last element of c is x, n is 2, and the current value of y is greater than or equal to the second last element of c. Otherwise, y is greater than x, n is 1, and the current value of y is greater than or equal to the last element of c.***
