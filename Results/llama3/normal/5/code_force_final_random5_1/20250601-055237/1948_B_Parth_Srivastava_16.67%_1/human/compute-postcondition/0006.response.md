Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a, n is 2, c is a list with at least three elements, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is the index of an element in a that is greater than 10. The current value of y is greater than or equal to the second last element of c, and the last element of c is x. Additionally, the first digit of the integer at index i in a (y) is less than or equal to the last digit of the integer at index i in a (x).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been incremented by 2, and two new elements `y` and `x` have been appended to the list `c`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
