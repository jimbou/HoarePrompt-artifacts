Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input array has less than 2 elements. In this case, the program will not work correctly because it tries to access the second element of the array (a[i-1]) without checking if it exists. This will result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

For example, if the input is:

1
1

The program will try to access a[-1] which does not exist, resulting in an error.

To fix this, the program should add a check to handle the case when the input array has less than 2 elements.
