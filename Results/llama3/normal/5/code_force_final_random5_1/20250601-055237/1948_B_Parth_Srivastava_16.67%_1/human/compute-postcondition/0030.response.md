Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x is the last digit of the integer at index i in a, y is the first digit of the integer at index i in a, n is either 3 or 4, and c is a list with at least four or five elements. If y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, then if y is less than or equal to x, then the last element of c is x, n is 4, and the current value of y is greater than or equal to the second last element of c. Otherwise, y is greater than x, n is 3, and the current value of y is greater than or equal to the last element of c. If a[i] is not greater than 10 or i is 0, then if i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 3 or 4, and c is a list containing either two or three elements: the first digit of a[i], the last digit of a[i], and/or the first digit of a[i] and/or the last digit of a[i]. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 4 and c contains both the first and last digits of a[i]. If y is greater than x, then n is 3 and c contains only the first digit of a[i]. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is 3, and c is a list containing a single integer which is the first element of a. i is increased by 1.**
