Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list with one element, stdin contains t test cases, c is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), n is equal to the length of c, d is a sorted list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If c is equal to d, then a contains 1. Otherwise, a contains 0.***
