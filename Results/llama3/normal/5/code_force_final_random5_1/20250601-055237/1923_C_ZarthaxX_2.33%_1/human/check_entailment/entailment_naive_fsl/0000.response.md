Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not based on the given conditions. It uses two auxiliary arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray, respectively.

The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element, printing 'NO' in this case.

The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is also correct. This condition checks whether it is possible to distribute the sum of the elements in the subarray among the elements in such a way that each element is greater than 1 and not equal to the original element.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
