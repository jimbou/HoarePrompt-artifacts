Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop due to the `continue` statement. No variables have changed values, and the stdin is still empty. The 'NO' that was printed remains printed.
