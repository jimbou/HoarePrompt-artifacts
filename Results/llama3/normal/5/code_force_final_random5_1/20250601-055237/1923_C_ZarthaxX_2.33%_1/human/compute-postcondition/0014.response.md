Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` and `r` are integers. If `l` is equal to `r`, 'NO' is printed and the loop moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
