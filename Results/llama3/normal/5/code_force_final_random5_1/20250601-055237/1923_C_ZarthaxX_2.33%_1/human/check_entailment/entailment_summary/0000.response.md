Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of 1s and the sum of elements in the prefix of the array `nums`, respectively. This is done to efficiently calculate the number of 1s and the sum of elements in any subarray.

2. The program then processes each query. For each query, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of elements (`sumInRange`) in the specified subarray.

3. The program then checks if the condition for a good subarray is met. The condition is that the sum of elements in the subarray should be greater than or equal to twice the number of 1s plus the length of the subarray minus the number of 1s. This is because each 1 in the subarray needs to be replaced with a 2 to satisfy the conditions for a good subarray, and the remaining elements should be able to accommodate this replacement.

4. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently processes each query in O(1) time using the precomputed `ones` and `sum` arrays. Therefore, the program's correctness is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
