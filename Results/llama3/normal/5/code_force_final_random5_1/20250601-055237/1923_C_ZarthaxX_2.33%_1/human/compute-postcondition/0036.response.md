Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` is an integer from stdin, `r` is an integer from stdin, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to the two integers read from stdin, which are split by a space. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are still dependent on the new values of `l` and `r`, but their exact values are not calculated here as they depend on the specific values of `ones` and `sum` lists.
