Output State: **n is an integer, i is n+1, q is at least 1, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers, sum is a list of n+1 integers, l and r are integers, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] - sum[l - 1].**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `i`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The code introduces two new variables: `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`. `onesInRange` is assigned the difference between the value of `ones` at index `r` and the value of `ones` at index `l-1`, while `sumInRange` is assigned the difference between the value of `sum` at index `r` and the value of `sum` at index `l-1`.
