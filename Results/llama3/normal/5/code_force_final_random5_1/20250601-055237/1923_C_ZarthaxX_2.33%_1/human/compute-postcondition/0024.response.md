Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to the two integers from the input, and the stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
