Postcondition: **n is an integer, i is n+1, q is at least 1, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers, sum is a list of n+1 integers, l and r are integers, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] - sum[l - 1]. The current value of onesInRange and sumInRange satisfy the condition: 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange.**
