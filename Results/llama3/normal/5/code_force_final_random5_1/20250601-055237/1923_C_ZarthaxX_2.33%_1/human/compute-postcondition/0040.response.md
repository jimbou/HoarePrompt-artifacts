Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
