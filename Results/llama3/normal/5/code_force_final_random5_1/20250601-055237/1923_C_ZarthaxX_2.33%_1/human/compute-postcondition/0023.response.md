To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `q`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `q`. Since `_` is not explicitly defined, we can assume it is an iteration counter that starts at 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be greater than the current value of `_`, which is 1 (since `_` starts at 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` and `r` are integers, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.**
