Output State: **n is an integer, i is n+1, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, stdin contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one more than the initial value of `n`, and the lists `ones` and `sum` will have been updated to reflect the number of 1s and the sum of the elements in the list `nums`, respectively, minus the index `i`. The other variables, `q`, `nums`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
