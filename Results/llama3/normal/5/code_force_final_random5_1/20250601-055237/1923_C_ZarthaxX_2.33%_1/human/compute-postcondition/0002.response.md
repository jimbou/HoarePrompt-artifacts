Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 1, q is an integer, nums is a list of two integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, stdin contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.**

The code updates the `ones` and `sum` lists based on the values in the `nums` list. The `ones` list now contains the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list, and the `sum` list contains the cumulative sum of the `nums` list minus the index. The `i` variable remains unchanged, and the `q` variable is not affected by the code. The `n` variable is still at least 1, and the `nums` list remains unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.
