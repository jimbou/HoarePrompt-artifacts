Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, i is n+1, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, stdin contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, i is n+1, q is at least 1, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers, sum is a list of n+1 integers, l and r are integers, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] - sum[l - 1]. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, i is n+1, q is at least 2, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers, sum is a list of n+1 integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin is empty. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, i is n+1, q is at least 3, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers, sum is a list of n+1 integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] - sum[l - 1]. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
