Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `l` equals `r`, 'NO' is printed and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
