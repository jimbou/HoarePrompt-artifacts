The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is at least 2. For the loop to execute again q must be at least 3.
State: **n is an integer, i is n+1, q is at least 3, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers, sum is a list of n+1 integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin is empty. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.**
