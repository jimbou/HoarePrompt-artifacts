To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1, and since `i` is the loop variable, its initial value should be 1, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `q` is an integer, `nums` is a list of two integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers**
