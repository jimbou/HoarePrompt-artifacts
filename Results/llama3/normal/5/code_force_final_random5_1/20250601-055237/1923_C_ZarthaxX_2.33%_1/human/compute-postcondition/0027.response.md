Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of all variables remain the same, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
