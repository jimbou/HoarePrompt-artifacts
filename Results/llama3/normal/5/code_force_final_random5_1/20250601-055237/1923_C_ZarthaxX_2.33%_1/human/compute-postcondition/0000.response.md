Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, nums is a list of two integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `q` are integers, which were obtained from the first line of the input. The value of `nums` is a list of two integers, which were obtained from the second line of the input. The lists `ones` and `sum` are initialized with `n+1` zeros. The remaining input in stdin consists of multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers followed by multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.
