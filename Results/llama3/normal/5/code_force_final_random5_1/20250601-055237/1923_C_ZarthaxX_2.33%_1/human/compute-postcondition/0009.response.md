Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers except the first query which has been read**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remain unchanged. The code only affects the values of `l` and `r`, which are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, split by a space. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, but the first query has been read and its values are stored in `l` and `r`.
