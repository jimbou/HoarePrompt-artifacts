Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n+1`, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers, `l` and `r` are integers and they are equal, stdin contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers, 'NO' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, and 'NO' is printed. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.
