Output State: **n is an integer, i is n+1, q is at least 3, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers, sum is a list of n+1 integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] - sum[l - 1].**

The code snippet consists of two lines that update the values of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`. The first line assigns the value of `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]` to `onesInRange`, and the second line assigns the value of `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]` to `sumInRange`. 

The values of `ones[r]`, `ones[l - 1]`, `sum[r]`, and `sum[l - 1]` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` after the code execution. However, we can conclude that `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` will be updated to reflect the differences between the values at indices `r` and `l - 1` in the `ones` and `sum` lists, respectively.

All other variables (`n`, `i`, `q`, `nums`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
