To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 1, it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `q` is an integer, `nums` is a list of two integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.**
