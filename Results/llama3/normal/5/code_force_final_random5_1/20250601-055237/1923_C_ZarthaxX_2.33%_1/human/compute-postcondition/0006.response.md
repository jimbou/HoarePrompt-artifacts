Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 3, q is an integer, nums is a list of three integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, stdin contains multiple test cases with a list of integers and multiple queries, each query being a list of two integers.**

The code modifies the values of `ones` and `sum` lists at index `i`. The new value of `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`, which is calculated by adding the number of 1s in the first `i-1` elements (`ones[i-1]`) to 1 if the `i-1`th element of `nums` is 1, or 0 otherwise. The new value of `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`, which is calculated by adding the sum of the first `i-1` elements (`sum[i-1]`) to the `i-1`th element of `nums` minus 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `q`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
