Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not based on the given conditions. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `nums`.

2. It then initializes two arrays `ones` and `sum` to keep track of the number of 1s and the sum of the elements minus the index, respectively.

3. For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the sum of the elements in the specified range.

4. It then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is met. This condition is derived from the given conditions in the problem statement.

5. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `l == r` by printing 'NO' immediately.

The time complexity of the program is O(n + q), where n is the length of the array and q is the number of queries. This is because it needs to iterate over the array once to calculate the `ones` and `sum` arrays, and then it needs to iterate over the queries.

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because it needs to store the `ones` and `sum` arrays.

Correctness: **True**
