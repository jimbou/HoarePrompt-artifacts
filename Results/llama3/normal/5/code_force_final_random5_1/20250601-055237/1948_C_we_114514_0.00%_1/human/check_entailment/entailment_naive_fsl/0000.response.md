Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The issue lies in the way it handles the movement of the robot. The program only checks if the robot can move to the right from the current cell, but it does not consider the case where the robot moves down and then follows the arrow in the cell below.

For example, consider the case where the input is:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because the robot can move down from the first cell, follow the arrow to the right, and then move down again to reach the cell (2, 4).

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle the movement of the robot and consider all possible paths to the cell (2, n).
