Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is at least 2, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the second test case, the number of elements, the second and third elements of the second test case, the list of results, the value of `j`, and the value of `reachable_first_row` are all the same as they were in the initial state.
