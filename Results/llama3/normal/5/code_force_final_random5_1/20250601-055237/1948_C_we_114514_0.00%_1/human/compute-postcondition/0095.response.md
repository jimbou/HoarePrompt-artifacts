Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is at least 2, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values except for `reachable_second_row`, which is now set to True, regardless of the previous values of `reachable_first_row`, `j`, `row1`, and `row2`.
