Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than or equal to 2, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for `reachable_second_row` which is now set to True, and `reachable_first_row` which is now set to False. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test_case`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `results` remain unchanged.
