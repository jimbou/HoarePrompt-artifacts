The function evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an even positive integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It determines whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string from the first string by moving right, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings representing the results of each test case. The function accepts a list of test cases as input and returns a list of strings indicating the reachability of the second string for each test case.
