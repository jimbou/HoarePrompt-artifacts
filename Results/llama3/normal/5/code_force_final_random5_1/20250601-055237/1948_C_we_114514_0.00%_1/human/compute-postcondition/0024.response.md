Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer. The list of test cases `test_cases` still has at least one test case. The current test case `test_case` is still the first test case in the list. The list of results `results` is still empty. The number of elements `n` in the first test case is still at least 2. The first row `row1` and the second row `row2` of the first test case are still the same. The variable `reachable_first_row` is still True if the second element of the first row is '>', otherwise it is False. The variable `reachable_second_row` is now True. The index `j` is still 1.
