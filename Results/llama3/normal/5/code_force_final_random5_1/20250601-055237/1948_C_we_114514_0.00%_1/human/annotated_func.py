    #State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is an empty list, test_case is undefined, n is undefined, row1 is undefined, row2 is undefined, reachable_first_row is undefined, reachable_second_row is undefined, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in the original test_cases list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', representing the results of each test case in the original test_cases list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an even positive integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It determines whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string from the first string by moving right, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings representing the results of each test case. The function accepts a list of test cases as input and returns a list of strings indicating the reachability of the second string for each test case.
