Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is at least 1. If `j` < `n` - 1 and `row2[j]` == '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False.***
