Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True, `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_first_row` is False.**

The code simply assigns the value True to the variable `reachable_second_row`. Since the initial state already had `reachable_second_row` as True, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables remain unchanged as well. The only notable point is that since `j` is equal to `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', the condition for `reachable_second_row` to be True is still satisfied. Additionally, since `row1[j]` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` remains False.
