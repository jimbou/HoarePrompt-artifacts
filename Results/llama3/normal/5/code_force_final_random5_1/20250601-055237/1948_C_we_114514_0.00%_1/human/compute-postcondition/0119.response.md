Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `reachable_first_row` is True, then if the current value of `row1` at index `j` is '>', then if `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False. If the current value of `row1` at index `j` is not '>', then if `j` is less than `n-1` and `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False.***
