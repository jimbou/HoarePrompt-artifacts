Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0. The current value of `reachable_first_row` is True. The current value of `row1[j]` is '>'. The current value of `j` is equal to `n - 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer. The list of test cases `test_cases` still has at least one test case. The first test case `test_case` remains the same. The list of results `results` is still empty. The number of elements `n` in the first test case is still at least 1. The first row `row1` and the second row `row2` of the first test case are unchanged. The variable `reachable_first_row` is still True, indicating that the first row is reachable. The variable `reachable_second_row` is now True, indicating that the second row is also reachable. The index `j` is still 0. The value of `row1[j]` is still '>', and `j` is still equal to `n - 1`.
