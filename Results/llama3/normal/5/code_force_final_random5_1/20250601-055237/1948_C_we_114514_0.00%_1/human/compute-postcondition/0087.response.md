According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `j`. So `j` is at least 2 and `n` is at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is at least 2. If `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` < `n` - 1, then if `row2[j]` == '>', `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**
