Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 1**

The code sets `reachable_second_row` to True, regardless of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
