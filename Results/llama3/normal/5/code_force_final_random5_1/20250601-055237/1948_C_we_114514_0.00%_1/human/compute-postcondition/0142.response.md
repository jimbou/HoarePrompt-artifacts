Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than `n`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is `n`, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `reachable_first_row` that is set to False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
