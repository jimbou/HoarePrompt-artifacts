Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' and now has one more 'YES' appended to it, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer. The list of `test_cases` still has at least 3 test cases, and `test_case` is still the third test case in the list. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain the same as they were before. The list `results` now has one more 'YES' appended to it. The values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False and True, respectively.
