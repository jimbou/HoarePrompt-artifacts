Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' and has an additional 'NO' appended to it, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer. The list of test cases `test_cases` remains unchanged with at least 3 test cases. The third test case `test_case` is still the same. The first element of the third test case `n` is still the same. The first and second elements of the second element of the third test case `row1` and `row2` are still the same. The list of results `results` now has an additional 'NO' appended to it. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are still False.
