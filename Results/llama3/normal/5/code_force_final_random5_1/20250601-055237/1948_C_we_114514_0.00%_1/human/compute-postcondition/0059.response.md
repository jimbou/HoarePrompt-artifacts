Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value True to the variable `reachable_second_row`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `reachable_first_row` is still True, indicating that the first row is reachable. The current value of `row1[j]` is still '>', and the current value of `j` is still equal to `n - 1`.
