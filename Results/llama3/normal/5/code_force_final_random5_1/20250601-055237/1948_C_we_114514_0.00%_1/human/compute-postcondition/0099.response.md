Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, test_case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, reachable_first_row is False, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', reachable_second_row is True if there is at least one '>' in row2, otherwise reachable_second_row is False.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains a positive integer, `test_cases` remains a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `test_case` remains the second test case in the list, `n` remains the first element of the second test case, `row1` remains the second element of the second test case, `row2` remains the third element of the second test case, and `results` remains a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'. The variable `reachable_first_row` is always False after the loop executes all the iterations. The variable `reachable_second_row` is True if there is at least one '>' in `row2`, otherwise it is False.
