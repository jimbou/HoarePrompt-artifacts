To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for test_case in test_cases:`. This means we can only adjust the state of `test_case` and `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, and `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 3 test cases, and `test_case` should be the third test case in the list.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, `results`, and `reachable_second_row`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is unknown, `row1` is unknown, `row2` is unknown, `reachable_first_row` is unknown, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `reachable_second_row` is unknown**
