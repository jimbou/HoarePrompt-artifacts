Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than or equal to 2, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is `n-1`, `reachable_second_row` is either True or False, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_first_row` has been updated to False, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `reachable_second_row`, `j`, `row1`, `row2`, and `n` are still valid, but `reachable_first_row` is now definitely False.
