Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `row1` at index `j` is '>'**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the third test case, the first element of the third test case, the first and second elements of the second element of the third test case, the results list, and the index `j` all retain their original values. The only change is that `reachable_second_row` is now True.
