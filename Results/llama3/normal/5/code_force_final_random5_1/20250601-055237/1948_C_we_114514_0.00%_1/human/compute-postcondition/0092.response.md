Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is at least 2, `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` is False, and `reachable_first_row` is False.***
