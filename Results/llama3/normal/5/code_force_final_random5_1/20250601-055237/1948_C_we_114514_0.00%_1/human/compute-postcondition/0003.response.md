To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the first element of the first test case, but we need to ensure it's at least 1 for the loop to execute. We also need to initialize `j` to 0, as it will be the loop counter.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is 0**
