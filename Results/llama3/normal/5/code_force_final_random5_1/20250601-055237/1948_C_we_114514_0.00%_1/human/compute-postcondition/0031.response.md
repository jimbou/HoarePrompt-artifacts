Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is either True or False depending on the value of `row1[j]`, and `reachable_second_row` is always True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer, and we still have a list of test cases with at least one test case. The first test case is still the same, and the list of results is still empty. The number of elements `n` in the first test case is still at least 2, and the first and second rows of the first test case are still the same. The value of `reachable_first_row` depends on whether the `j-th` element of the first row is '>', but the value of `reachable_second_row` is now always True, regardless of the previous conditions.
