Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is `n`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer. The list of `test_cases` still has at least 3 test cases. The `test_case` is still the third test case in the list. The value of `n` is still the first element of the third test case and is greater than 0. The values of `row1` and `row2` are still the same. The list of `results` still contains 'YES' or 'NO'. The value of `j` is still equal to `n`. The value of `reachable_first_row` is still True. The value of `reachable_second_row` is now True, regardless of the previous conditions.
