To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `test_case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer and `results` is an empty list, these states do not affect the execution of the loop.

So, for the loop to be executed, `test_cases` must have at least 1 test case, and `test_case` is the first test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
