Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of the first test case, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `row2[j]` is '>'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. `reachable_first_row` is either True or False depending on the value of `row1[j]`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` is always True if `j` is equal to `n - 1`, or `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', and remains unchanged otherwise. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
