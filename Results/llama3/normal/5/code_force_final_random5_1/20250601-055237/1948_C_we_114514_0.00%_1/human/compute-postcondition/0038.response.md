Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `j` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_first_row` has been updated to False, while the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `reachable_second_row` is not affected by this code snippet, so its value remains the same as before. The rest of the variables retain their initial values, with `t` being a positive integer, `test_cases` having at least one test case, `test_case` being the first test case, `results` being an empty list, `n` being at least 3, `row1` and `row2` being the second and third elements of the first test case, respectively, and `j` being 2.
