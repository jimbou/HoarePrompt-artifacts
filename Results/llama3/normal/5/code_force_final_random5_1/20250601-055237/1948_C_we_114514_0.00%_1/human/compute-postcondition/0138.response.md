Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than or equal to 2, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `j` equals `n-1` and `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True and `reachable_first_row` is False. Otherwise, the values of `j`, `row1`, `row2`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.***
