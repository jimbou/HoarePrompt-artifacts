Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the first element of `row1` at index `j` is not '>', the current value of `j` is less than `n-1` and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the third test case, the first element of the third test case, the first and second elements of the second element of the third test case, the list of results, and the value of `j` are all unchanged. The first element of `row1` at index `j` is still not '>', and the current value of `j` is still less than `n-1`, and the current value of `row2[j]` is still '>'.
