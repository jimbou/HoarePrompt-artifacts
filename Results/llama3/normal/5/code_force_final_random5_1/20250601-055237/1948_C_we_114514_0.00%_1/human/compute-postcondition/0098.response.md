Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is at least 2. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `row2[j]` is '>', the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `row2[j]` is not '>', then if `reachable_first_row` is True, if `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` < `n` - 1, then if `row1[j]` == '>', `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `row2[j]` == '>', `reachable_second_row` is True, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is False, and `reachable_first_row` is False. If `reachable_first_row` is False, then `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.***
