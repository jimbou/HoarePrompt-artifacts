Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of an even positive integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test_case in test_cases:
    n, (row1, row2) = test_case
    reachable_first_row = True
    reachable_second_row = False
    for j in range(n):
        if reachable_first_row:
            if row1[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
            else:
                reachable_first_row = False
                if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            if row2[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False. If `row2` contains only '>' characters, then `results` is a list containing 'YES' and `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 'NO' and `reachable_second_row` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, test_case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, reachable_first_row is False. If there is at least one '>' in row2, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' and now contains one more 'YES', and reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' and 'NO', and reachable_second_row is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, row1 is the first element of the second element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the second element of the third test case, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'. If reachable_second_row is True, results has one more 'YES' appended to it and reachable_second_row remains True. If reachable_second_row is False, results has one more 'NO' appended to it and reachable_second_row becomes False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
