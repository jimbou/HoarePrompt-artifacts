Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True if `row2` contains only '>' characters, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `reachable_first_row` is always False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if all characters in `row2` are '>', otherwise it is False. The other variables remain unchanged.
