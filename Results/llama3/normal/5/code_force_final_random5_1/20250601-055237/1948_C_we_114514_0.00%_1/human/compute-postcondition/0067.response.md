Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is 0. If `reachable_first_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>' and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, or if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>'. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False. If `row1[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False.***
