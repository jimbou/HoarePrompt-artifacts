Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' and 'NO', `reachable_second_row` is False because there is no '>' in row2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer. The `test_cases` list still contains at least 2 test cases. The `test_case` variable still refers to the second test case in the list. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged as the first, second, and third elements of the second test case, respectively. The `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` variables remain False. The `results` list now contains an additional 'NO' value, in addition to its previous 'YES' or 'NO' values.
