Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is at least 2, `reachable_second_row` is either True or False depending on the conditions, and `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values and conditions, except for `reachable_first_row`, which is now explicitly set to False. The other variables, including `t`, `test_cases`, `test_case`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `results`, `j`, and `reachable_second_row`, remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.
