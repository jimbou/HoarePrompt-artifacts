Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is 0. The current value of `reachable_second_row` is False. The first element of the second element of the first test case at index `j` is not '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_first_row` has been changed to False, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The list of test cases, the first test case, the results list, the number of elements in the first test case, the first and second rows of the first test case, the reachability of the second row, and the index `j` are all unchanged.
