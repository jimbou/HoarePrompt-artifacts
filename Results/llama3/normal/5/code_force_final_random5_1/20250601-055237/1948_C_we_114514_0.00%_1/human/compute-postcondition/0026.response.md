Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True if `row2[j]` is '>', `j` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_first_row` is set to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the first test case, the results list, the number of elements in the first test case, the first and second rows of the first test case, and the index `j` remain the same. The value of `reachable_second_row` is still dependent on the value of `row2[j]`.
