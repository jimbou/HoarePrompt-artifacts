Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than `n`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is `n`. If `reachable_first_row` is True, then if `j` is equal to `n - 1` or if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
