Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than `n`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is `n`, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been set to True. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The number of test cases, the composition of the test cases, and the values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `results`, and `j` are all preserved.
