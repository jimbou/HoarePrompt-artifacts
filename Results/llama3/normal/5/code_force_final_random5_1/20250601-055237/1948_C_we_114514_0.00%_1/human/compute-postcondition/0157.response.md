Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is an empty list, test_case is undefined, n is undefined, row1 is undefined, row2 is undefined, reachable_first_row is undefined, reachable_second_row is undefined, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in the original test_cases list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the test_cases list. The test_cases list is now empty, and the test_case, n, row1, and row2 variables are undefined because they are no longer needed. The reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row variables are also undefined because they are only used within the loop. The results list now contains a 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in the original test_cases list, indicating whether the second row is reachable for each test case.
