Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is at least 1, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, except for `reachable_first_row`, which is now explicitly set to False. The rest of the variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
