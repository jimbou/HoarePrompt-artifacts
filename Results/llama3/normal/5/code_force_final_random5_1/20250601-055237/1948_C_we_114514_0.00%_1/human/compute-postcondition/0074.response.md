Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `j` is equal to `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True and `reachable_first_row` is False. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, the state of `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.***
