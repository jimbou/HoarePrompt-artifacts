Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False**

In this output state, the code has appended 'NO' to the `results` list, which was initially empty. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The `results` list now contains a single element, 'NO', indicating that the first test case has been processed with a negative outcome.
