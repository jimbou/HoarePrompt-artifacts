Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False. `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is equal to `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is '>', or if `j` < `n` - 1 and the first element of the second element of the first test case at index `j` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` is False. `j` is 0.**
