Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False. If `row2` contains only '>' characters, then `results` is a list containing 'YES' and `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 'NO' and `reachable_second_row` is False.***
