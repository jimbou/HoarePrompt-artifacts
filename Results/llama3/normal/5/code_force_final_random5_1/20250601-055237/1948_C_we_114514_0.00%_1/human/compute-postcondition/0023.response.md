The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `row2[j]` is '>', `j` is 1**
