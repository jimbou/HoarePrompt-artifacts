The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, but we know that `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`. Since `n` is at least 2, we can conclude that `j` is at least 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be 2 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. `reachable_first_row` is either True or False depending on the value of `row1[j]`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` is always True if `j` is equal to `n - 1`, or `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', and remains unchanged otherwise. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, `j` is 2**
