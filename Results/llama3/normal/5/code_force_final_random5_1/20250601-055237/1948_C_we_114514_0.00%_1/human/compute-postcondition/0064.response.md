Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0 and is less than `n - 1`, `row2[j]` is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the current test case, the number of rows, the first and second rows, the reachability of the first row, the results list, and the current index `j` and its corresponding value in `row2` are all the same as before.
