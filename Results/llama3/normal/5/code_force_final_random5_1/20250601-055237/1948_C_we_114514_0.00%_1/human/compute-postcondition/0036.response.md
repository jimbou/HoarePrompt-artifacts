Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is either True or False depending on the value of `row1[j]`, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 2**

The code sets `reachable_second_row` to True, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `reachable_first_row` is still dependent on the value of `row1[j]`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test_case`, `results`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `j` are not affected by the code.
