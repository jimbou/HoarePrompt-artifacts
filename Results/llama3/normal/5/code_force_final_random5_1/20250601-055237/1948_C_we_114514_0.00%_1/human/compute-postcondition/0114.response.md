Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the first element of `row1` at index `j` is not '>'**

In this output state, the only change is that `reachable_first_row` is now False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the third test case, the first element of the third test case, the first and second elements of the second element of the third test case, the list of results, and the index `j` all remain the same. The condition that `n` is greater than 0 and the first element of `row1` at index `j` is not '>' also still holds.
