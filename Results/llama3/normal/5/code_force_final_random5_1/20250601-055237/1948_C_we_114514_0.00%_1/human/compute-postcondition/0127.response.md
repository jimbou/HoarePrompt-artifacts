The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `j`. Since `j` is not specified, we can assume that `j` is equal to the last value that was less than `n`. So `j` is equal to `n-1` and `n` must be greater than `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than or equal to 2, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is `n-1`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `row2[j]` is '>', `j` is either equal to `n - 1` or less than `n-1`. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is not '>', then `j` is less than `n-1`. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then the values of `j`, `row1`, `row2`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.**
