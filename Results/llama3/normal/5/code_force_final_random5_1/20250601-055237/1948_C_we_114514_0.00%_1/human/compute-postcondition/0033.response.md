Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. `reachable_first_row` is either True or False depending on the value of `row1[j]`. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is always True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', and remains unchanged otherwise.***
