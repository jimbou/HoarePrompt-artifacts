According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 2 test cases the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, reachable_first_row is False. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 test cases and the test_case is the second test case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `reachable_second_row` is True or False**
