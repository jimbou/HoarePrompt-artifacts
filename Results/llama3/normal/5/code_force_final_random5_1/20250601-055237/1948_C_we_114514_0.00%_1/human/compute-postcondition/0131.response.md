Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and is greater than or equal to 2, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is `n-1`, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the third test case, the number of elements in the third test case, the first and second rows of the second element of the third test case, the list of results, the value of `j`, and the value of `reachable_first_row` are all the same as before.
