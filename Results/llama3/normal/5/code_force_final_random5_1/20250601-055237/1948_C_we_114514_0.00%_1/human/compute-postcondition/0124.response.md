Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is greater than 0. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `j` is equal to `n - 1` and `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `j` is less than `n-1`***
