Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True because `row2` contains only '>' characters.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `results` list now contains the string 'YES', which was appended by the code. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
