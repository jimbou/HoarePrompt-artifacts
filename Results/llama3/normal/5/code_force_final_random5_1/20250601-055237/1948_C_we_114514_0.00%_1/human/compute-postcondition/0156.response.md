Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, row1 is the first element of the second element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the second element of the third test case, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'. If reachable_second_row is True, results has one more 'YES' appended to it and reachable_second_row remains True. If reachable_second_row is False, results has one more 'NO' appended to it and reachable_second_row becomes False.***
