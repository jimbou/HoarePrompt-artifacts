Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO', `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

The code simply assigns `True` to `reachable_second_row`, so the value of `reachable_second_row` is updated to `True`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
