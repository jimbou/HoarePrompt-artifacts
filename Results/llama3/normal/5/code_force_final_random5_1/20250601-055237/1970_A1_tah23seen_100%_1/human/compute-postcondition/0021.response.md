To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for (i, j) in d:`, which means we are iterating over the key-value pairs of the dictionary `d`. The variables `i` and `j` are the key and value of each pair, respectively.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is a new key `i'` that is different from the current key `i`, and `j` is the value associated with the new key `i'`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `j` to point to the next key-value pair in the dictionary `d`. Since `d` contains at least 2 key-value pairs, we can assume that there is another pair to iterate over.

Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `i` becomes the next key in the dictionary `d`, which is different from the current key `i'`.
* `j` becomes the value associated with the new key `i`.

The other variables `s`, `ans`, and `d` do not need to be adjusted, as they are not involved in the loop head.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s` and the character at index `i` of `s`, `d` is a dictionary containing at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is a new key that is different from the current key `i'`, `j` is the value associated with the new key `i`**
