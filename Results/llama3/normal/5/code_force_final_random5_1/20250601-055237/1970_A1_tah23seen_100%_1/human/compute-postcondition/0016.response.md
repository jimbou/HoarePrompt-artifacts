Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, ans is an empty string, d is a dictionary containing n key-value pairs: for each i from 0 to n-1, i maps to the sum of 1 for each "(" and -1 for each ")" in the substring s[0..i-1], and i is n-1.**

Explanation: The first line removes the key-value pair with key `n` from the dictionary `d`. The second line sorts the remaining key-value pairs in `d` based on their values and then by their keys in descending order. Since `d` initially contains `n+1` key-value pairs, after removing the pair with key `n`, it now contains `n` pairs. The value of `i` is decremented by 1 because the key `n` is removed from the dictionary. The string `s` and the variable `ans` remain unchanged.
