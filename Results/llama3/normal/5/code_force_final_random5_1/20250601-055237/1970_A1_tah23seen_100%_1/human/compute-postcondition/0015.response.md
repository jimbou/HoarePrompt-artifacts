Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary containing `n+1` key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `i` maps to the sum of 1 for each "(" and -1 for each ")" in the substring `s[0..i-1]`, and `i` is `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, the answer string `ans` is still empty, and the dictionary `d` now contains `n+1` key-value pairs, where each key `i` from 0 to `n` maps to the sum of 1 for each "(" and -1 for each ")" in the substring `s[0..i-1]`. The loop variable `i` has reached the end of the string, with a value of `n`.
