Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary containing four key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is "(" or -1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is ")", 2 maps to either 2 if the character at index 0 of `s` is "(" or 0 if the character at index 0 of `s` is ")" if the character at index i of `s` is "(", otherwise 2 maps to either 0 if the character at index 0 of `s` is "(" or -2 if the character at index 0 of `s` is ")" if the character at index i of `s` is ")", and 3 maps to either 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is "(" or -3 if the character at index 0 of `s` is ")" if the character at index i of `s` is "(", otherwise 3 maps to either -1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is "(" or -3 if the character at index 0 of `s` is ")" if the character at index i of `s` is ")", and `i` is 3**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is `i + 1` (which is 3) and the value is `d[i] - 1` (which is either 1 or -3 depending on the character at index 0 of `s` and the character at index i of `s`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
