This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input and returns a rearranged string consisting of the same characters, sorted by their corresponding depth in the parentheses sequence. The depth is calculated by incrementing for each opening parenthesis and decrementing for each closing parenthesis. The function effectively reorders the characters based on their depth, with characters at the same depth appearing in their original order.
