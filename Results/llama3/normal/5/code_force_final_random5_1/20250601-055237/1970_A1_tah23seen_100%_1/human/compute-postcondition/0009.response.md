Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary containing three key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is "(" or -1 if the character at index 0 of `s` is ")", and 2 maps to either 0 if the character at index 0 of `s` is "(" or -2 if the character at index 0 of `s` is ")", and `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `d[i + 1]` is updated to `d[i] - 1`, which means that the value of `d[2]` is either 0 or -2, depending on the character at index 0 of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
