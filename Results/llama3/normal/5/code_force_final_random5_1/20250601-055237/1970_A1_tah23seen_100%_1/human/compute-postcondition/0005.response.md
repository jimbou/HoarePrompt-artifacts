Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary containing two key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to -1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is ")"**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is `i + 1` (which is 1) and the value is `d[i] - 1` (which is -1). The other variables remain unchanged.
