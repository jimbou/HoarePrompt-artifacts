To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s` (through its length `n`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the length of `s`, which is not exceeding 500,000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

The state of `s` itself does not change, but its length `n` remains the same.

The states of `ans` and `d` are not directly related to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary containing two key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to either 1 if the character at index i of `s` is "(" or -1 if the character at index i of `s` is ")", and `i` is 1**
