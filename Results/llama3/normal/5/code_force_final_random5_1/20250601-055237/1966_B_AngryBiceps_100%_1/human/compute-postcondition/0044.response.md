The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `m`. Since `n` was 0, it becomes the first integer value from stdin, and `m` becomes the second integer value from stdin. Stdin now contains t-2 test cases. The second line initializes `a` as an empty list. The third and fourth lines initialize `first_row` and `last_row` as empty strings. The fifth line does not affect any variables. The sixth line assigns the value of `n-1` to `i`. Since `n` is now the first integer value from stdin, `i` becomes that value minus 1. The seventh line does not affect any variables. The eighth line assigns the value of 2 to `_`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is the first integer value from stdin, m is the second integer value from stdin, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 2, i is n-1**
