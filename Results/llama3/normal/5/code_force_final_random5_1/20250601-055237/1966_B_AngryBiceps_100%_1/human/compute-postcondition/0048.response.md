The code block consists of three lines that modify the variables `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line appends the next input from stdin to the list `a`. Since `a` initially contains one element (the first input read from stdin), it now contains two elements. Stdin now contains t-4 test cases.
*   The second line appends the first character of the last element added to `a` (i.e., the second input read from stdin) to the string `first_row`. This means `first_row` now contains the first character of the first input and the first character of the second input.
*   The third line appends the last character of the last element added to `a` (i.e., the second input read from stdin) to the string `last_row`. This means `last_row` now contains the last character of the first input and the last character of the second input.

The variables `n`, `m`, `i`, and `_` are not modified by the code block, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **a is a list containing two elements (the first two inputs read from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the first input and the first character of the second input, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first input and the last character of the second input, n is greater than 1, m is the second integer value from stdin, i is 1, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
