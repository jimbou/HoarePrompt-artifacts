Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases, _ is 1, i is n-1**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `_`, or `i`. It initializes `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` as empty list, string, and string respectively. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it still contains `t-n-1` test cases.
