Postcondition: **n is 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing n characters, last_row is a string containing n characters, stdin contains t test cases, _ is 1, i is n-1. If the first and last strings in the list a contain only one unique character each and these characters are different from each other, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the first and last strings in the list a are single-character strings and are different, 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.**
