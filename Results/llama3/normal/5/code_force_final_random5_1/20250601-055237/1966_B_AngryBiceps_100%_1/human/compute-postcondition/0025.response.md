Output State: **n is greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a list containing one string, first_row is a string containing one character, last_row is a string containing one character, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 1, i is 0**

The code block reads a line from stdin and appends it to the list `a`. The first character of this line is appended to `first_row`, and the last character is appended to `last_row`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, it now contains one string. `first_row` and `last_row`, which were initially empty strings, now contain one character each. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
