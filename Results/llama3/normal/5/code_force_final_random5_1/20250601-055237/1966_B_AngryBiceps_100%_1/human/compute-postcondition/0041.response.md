Postcondition: ***n is 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing n characters, last_row is a string containing n characters, stdin contains t test cases, _ is 1, i is n-1.

If the first and last rows are single-character strings and are different, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
