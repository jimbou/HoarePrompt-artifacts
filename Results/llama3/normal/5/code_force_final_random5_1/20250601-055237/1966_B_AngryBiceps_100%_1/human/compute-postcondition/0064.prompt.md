Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 500) followed by n strings of length m consisting of 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of each input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of each input string, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 0, i is n-1. If the first and last strings in the list a have the same character repeated throughout but are not identical, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either the first and last strings in the list a do not have the same character repeated throughout, or they are identical, or the first and last strings have the same character repeated throughout but are identical, and 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing n characters, last_row is a string containing n characters, stdin contains t test cases, _ is 1, i is n-1. If the first and last strings in the list a contain only one unique character each and these characters are different from each other, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the first and last strings in the list a are single-character strings and are different, 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is a list containing n elements (all the inputs read from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of each input, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input, n is 0, m is the second integer value from stdin, i is n-1, _ is 2, stdin contains t-n test cases. If the first and last elements of a are strings with all characters being the same but not equal, then 'NO' is printed. If the first and last elements of a are not single-character strings, or the first and last elements of a are the same, or both the first and last elements of a are single-character strings, then if first_row and last_row are single-character strings and they are not equal, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
