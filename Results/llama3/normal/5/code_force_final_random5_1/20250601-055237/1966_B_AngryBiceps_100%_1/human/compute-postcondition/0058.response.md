Output: **a is a list containing n elements (all the inputs read from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of each input, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input, n is 0, m is the second integer value from stdin, i is n-1, _ is 2, stdin contains t-n test cases. Either the first and last elements of a are not single-character strings, or the first and last elements of a are the same, or both the first and last elements of a are single-character strings. The current value of first_row and last_row are single-character strings and they are not equal, and 'NO' is being printed**
