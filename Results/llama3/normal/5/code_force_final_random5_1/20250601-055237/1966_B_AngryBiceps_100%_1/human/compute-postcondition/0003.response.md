Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a list containing one string, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of the input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of the input string, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0, i is 0**

The code block reads a line from stdin and appends it to the list `a`. The first character of this input string is appended to `first_row`, and the last character is appended to `last_row`. Since `a` was initially empty, it now contains one string. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
