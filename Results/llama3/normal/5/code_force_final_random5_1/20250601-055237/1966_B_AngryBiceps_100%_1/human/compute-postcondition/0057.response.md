Based on the initial state, the code `print('NO')` will print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, `n`, `m`, `i`, and `_`.

The reason is that the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or their values. It simply prints the string 'NO' as is.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
