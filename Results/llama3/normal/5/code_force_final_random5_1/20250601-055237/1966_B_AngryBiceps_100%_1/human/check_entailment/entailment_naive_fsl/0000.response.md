Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are the same color, but there is a column in the middle that has a different color. The program will incorrectly print "YES" in this case.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:

    3 3
    
    WWW
    
    WBW
    
    WWW

Output:

    YES

However, it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations, because the middle column has a different color.

The program only checks if the first and last rows are the same color, and if the first and last columns are the same color. It does not check if there are any columns or rows in the middle that have a different color. Therefore, it is incorrect.
