To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one string, `first_row` is a string containing one character, `last_row` is a string containing one character, `stdin` contains `t-n` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is 1**
