Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters can be made into a single color by selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them.

The program checks two conditions:

1. If the first and last rows of the grid are single-character strings and different from each other, it prints 'NO'. This is because if the first and last rows are different, it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color by selecting two squares of the same color.

2. If the first and last columns of the grid are single-character strings and different from each other, it prints 'NO'. This is because if the first and last columns are different, it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color by selecting two squares of the same color.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the grid can be made into a single color.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
