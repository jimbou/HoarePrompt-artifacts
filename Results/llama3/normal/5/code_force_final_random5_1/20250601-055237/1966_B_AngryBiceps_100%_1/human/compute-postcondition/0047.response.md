To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it remains the same.

The other variables, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, `m`, `_`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list containing one element (the input read from stdin), `first_row` is a string containing the first character of the input, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of the input, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the second integer value from stdin, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases**
