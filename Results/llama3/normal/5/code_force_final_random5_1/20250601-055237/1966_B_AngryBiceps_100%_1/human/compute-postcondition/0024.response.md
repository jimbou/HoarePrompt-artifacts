The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-n-1` test cases, `_` is 1, `i` is 0**
