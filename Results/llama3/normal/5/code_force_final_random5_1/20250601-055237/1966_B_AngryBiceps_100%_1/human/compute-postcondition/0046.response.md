The code snippet consists of three lines that operate on the variables `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

1. `a.append(input())`: This line reads the next input from stdin and appends it to the list `a`. Since `a` is initially an empty list, this line adds the first element to `a`. The input is read from stdin, which initially contains t-2 test cases. After this line, stdin contains t-3 test cases.

2. `first_row += a[-1][0]`: This line appends the first character of the last element in `a` (which is the input read in the previous line) to the string `first_row`. Since `first_row` is initially an empty string, this line sets it to the first character of the input.

3. `last_row += a[-1][-1]`: This line appends the last character of the last element in `a` (which is the input read in the first line) to the string `last_row`. Since `last_row` is initially an empty string, this line sets it to the last character of the input.

After executing the entire code block, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `a` is a list containing one element, which is the input read from stdin.
- `first_row` is a string containing the first character of the input.
- `last_row` is a string containing the last character of the input.
- `n` is still greater than 0, as it is not modified by the code.
- `m` is still the second integer value from stdin, as it is not modified by the code.
- `i` is still 0, as it is not modified by the code.
- `_` is still 2, as it is not modified by the code.
- stdin contains t-3 test cases, as one input is read and processed by the code.

Output State: **a is a list containing one element (the input read from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the input, last_row is a string containing the last character of the input, n is greater than 0, m is the second integer value from stdin, i is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases**
