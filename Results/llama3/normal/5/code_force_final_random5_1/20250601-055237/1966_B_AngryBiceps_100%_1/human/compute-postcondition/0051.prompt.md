Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the first integer value from stdin, m is the second integer value from stdin, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 2, i is n-1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list containing one element (the input read from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the input, last_row is a string containing the last character of the input, n is greater than 0, m is the second integer value from stdin, i is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list containing two elements (the first two inputs read from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the first input and the first character of the second input, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first input and the last character of the second input, n is greater than 1, m is the second integer value from stdin, i is 1, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list containing three elements (the first three inputs read from stdin), first_row is a string containing the first character of the first input, the first character of the second input, and the first character of the third input, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first input, the last character of the second input, and the last character of the third input, n is greater than 2, m is the second integer value from stdin, i is 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
