Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of characters ('W' and 'B'). It checks if the first and last rows or columns of the grid are single-character strings and different from each other. If so, it prints 'NO', indicating that the grid does not meet the condition. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', indicating that the grid meets the condition. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each one.**
