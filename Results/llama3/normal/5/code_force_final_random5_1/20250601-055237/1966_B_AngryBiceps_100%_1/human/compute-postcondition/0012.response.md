Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer greater than 0, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string consisting of the first character of each input string, last_row is a string consisting of the last character of each input string, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 0, i is n-1. Additionally, the condition that the first and last strings in the list a have the same character repeated throughout, and the first and last strings are not identical, is not met. This means that either the first and last strings do not have the same character repeated throughout, or they are identical.***
