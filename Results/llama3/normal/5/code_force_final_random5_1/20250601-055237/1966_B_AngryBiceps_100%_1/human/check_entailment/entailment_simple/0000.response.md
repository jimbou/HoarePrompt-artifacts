Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of rows and columns in the grid, and the initial colors of the squares of the grid.

The program then checks if the first and last rows of the grid contain only one unique character each and these characters are different from each other. If this is the case, it prints 'NO', because it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

If the first and last rows of the grid are single-character strings and are different, the program also prints 'NO', because it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

In all other cases, the program prints 'YES', because it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
