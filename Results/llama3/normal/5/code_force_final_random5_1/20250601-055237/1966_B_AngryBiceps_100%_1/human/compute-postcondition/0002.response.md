The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than 0, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the first value in the range of `n`).

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**
