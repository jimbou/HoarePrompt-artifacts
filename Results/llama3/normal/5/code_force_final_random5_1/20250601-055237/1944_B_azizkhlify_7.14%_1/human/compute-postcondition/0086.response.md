Postcondition: **All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, `ul` and `ur` are equal, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 2, `ur` was increased by 2, and `a[i]` which was equal to 2 was printed twice, followed by a space. Otherwise, nothing was printed. The current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur`.**
