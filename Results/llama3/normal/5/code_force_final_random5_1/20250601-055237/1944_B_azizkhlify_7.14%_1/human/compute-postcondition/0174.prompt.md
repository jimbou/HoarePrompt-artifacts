Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n`, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is the number of occurrences of a[i] in a and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is the number of occurrences of a[i] in a and the rest are 1, if re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes have been made, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is a list containing the first element of a, stdin contains no input, i is 0, k is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and the first element of the list a which is a[0] has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first two elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `re` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, the first element of the list `a` which is `a[0]` has been printed, and the second element of the list `a` which is `a[1]` is being printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first three elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first two elements of `a`, `re` is equal to `k + 1`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, the first element of the list `a` which is `a[0]` has been printed, the second element of the list `a` which is `a[1]` is being printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and the third element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is being printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
