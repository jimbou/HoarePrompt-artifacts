Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If the number of occurrences of the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is 2, then `ul` is equal to `k` times 2 plus 2 and the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is printed twice. Otherwise, `ul` remains equal to `k` times 2.***
