Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n`, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been updated to be twice its original value, since `ul` is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
