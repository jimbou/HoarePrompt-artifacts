Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `a` is a list of integers.
* `i` is an integer equal to 1.
* The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]`, which is the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

Since `i` is 1, we are printing the second element of the list `a` (remember that indexing starts at 0).

Output: **the second element of the list a**
