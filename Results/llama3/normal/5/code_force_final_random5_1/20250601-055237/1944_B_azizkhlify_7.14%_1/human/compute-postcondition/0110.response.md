Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` at index `a[0] - 1` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now has a 1 at the index corresponding to the value of the first element of list `a` minus 1, and all other elements of `l` are still 0.
