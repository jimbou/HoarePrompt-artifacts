Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, ul is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the values of a[i] for all i in range(min(n, k)) if k is non-zero, otherwise res is an empty list, and i is equal to the minimum of n and k, and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, `ul` is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the values of a[i] for all i in range(min(n, k)) if k is non-zero, and the first element in the list `res` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, `ul` is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the values of a[i] for all i in range(min(n, k)) if k is non-zero, the first element in the list `res` which is `i` has been printed and the second element in the list `res` which is `i` is being printed, and this is printed: `i` followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, `ul` is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the values of a[i] for all i in range(min(n, k)) if k is non-zero, the first element in the list `res` which is `i` has been printed and the second element in the list `res` which is `i` has been printed and a space has been printed, and this is printed: the value of `i` followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
