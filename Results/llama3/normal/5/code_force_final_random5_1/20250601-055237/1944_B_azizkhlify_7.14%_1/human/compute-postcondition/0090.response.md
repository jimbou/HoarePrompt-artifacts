Based on the precondition, we know that all elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed. We also know that `n` is at least 1, and `i` is `n + 1`.

The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`. Here, `a[i]` is printed twice, and the `end=' '` argument means that a space will be printed after the second `a[i]`.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, we are trying to access the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`. However, since `n` is at least 1, `n + 1` is out of range for the list `a`, which has only `n` elements ( indexed from 0 to `n - 1`).

Therefore, this will result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception, because we are trying to access an index that does not exist in the list `a`.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
