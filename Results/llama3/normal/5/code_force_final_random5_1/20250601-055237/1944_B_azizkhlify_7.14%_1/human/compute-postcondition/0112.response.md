Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1, in addition to `l[a[0] - 1]` which was already 1. The rest of the values in `l` remain 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
