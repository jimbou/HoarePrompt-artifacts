Output: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is the number of occurrences of a[i] in a and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is the number of occurrences of a[i] in a and the rest are 1, if re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes have been made, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is a list containing the first element of a, stdin contains no input, i is 1, k is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and the first element of the list a which is a[0] has been printed, and the second element of the list a which is a[1] is being printed**
