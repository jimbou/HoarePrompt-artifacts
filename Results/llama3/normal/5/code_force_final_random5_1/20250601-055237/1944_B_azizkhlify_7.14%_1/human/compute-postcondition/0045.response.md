Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0. The current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 1, and the value of `a[i]` is being printed**
