Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 3 for i = n, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, and nothing is printed, `i` is `n + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `r` at index `a[n] - 1` is incremented by 1, in addition to the previous increment by 2, resulting in a total increment of 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
