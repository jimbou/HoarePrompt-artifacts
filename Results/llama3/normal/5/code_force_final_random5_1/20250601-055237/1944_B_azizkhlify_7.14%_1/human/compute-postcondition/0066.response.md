Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, ul is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the values of a[i] for all i in range(min(n, k)) if k is non-zero, otherwise res is an empty list, and i is equal to the minimum of n and k.**
