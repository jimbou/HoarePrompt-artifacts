Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, re is 0, ul is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, ur is 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is equal to the minimum of n and k.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, ul is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i], and i is 0. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of re, ul, ur, res, and i remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, ul is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i], and i is 1. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, then i is 2, the value of a[2] is being printed, and re is 2. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, ul is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i], and i is 3 if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, otherwise i is 2. If l[a[i] - 1] is 1 and re is equal to k, the value of a[3] has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
