The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `2 * n`, so `i` is at least `n + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is at least `n + 1`, and nothing is printed.**
