Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the integers, printing pairs of identical numbers until it reaches a total of k pairs, and then prints a single number if k is odd. If there are remaining pairs, it prints them. The function repeats this process for each test case, printing the results followed by a newline character.**
