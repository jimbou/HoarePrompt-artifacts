Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, and nothing is printed, `i` is 2. If the value at index a[2] - 1 in list `l` is 2, then `ul` is incremented by 2, and the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is printed. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
