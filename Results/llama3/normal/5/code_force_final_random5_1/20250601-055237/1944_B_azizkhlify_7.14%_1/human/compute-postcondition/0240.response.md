Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, and nothing is printed, `i` is 0. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list `l` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[0]` is printed twice with a space in between, and `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `ul` is equal to `k` multiplied by 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
