Output State: **All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `ur` is increased by 2, and this is printed: a[i] which is equal to 2, a[i] which is equal to 2, followed by a space**

In this output state, the value of `ur` has been increased by 2, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `res` has been fully printed, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is still 2. The values of `n` and `i` are still at least 1 and equal to `n`, respectively. The inequality between `ul` and `ur` is still valid.
