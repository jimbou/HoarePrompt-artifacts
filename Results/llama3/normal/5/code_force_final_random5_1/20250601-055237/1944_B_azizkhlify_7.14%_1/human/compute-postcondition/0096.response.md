State: **All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 2`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `a[n+2]` (twice) followed by a space and 2 are printed. If `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing additional is printed.**
