Output: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and the list `res` is empty. The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and this is printed: `a[i]` which is equal to `a[2 * n]` and `a[i]` which is equal to `a[2 * n]`**
