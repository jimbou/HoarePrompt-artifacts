Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - 2 * n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by `n` for `i = n`, `res` is a list containing a single element which is the value of `a[i]` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `res` is an empty list, `re` is `n` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `re` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `ul` is `2 * n`, `ur` is 0. If `k` is not zero, then the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `i`, `ul`, `ur` are updated according to the conditions specified in the if part. If `k` is zero, then the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `i`, `ul`, `ur` remain unchanged.**
