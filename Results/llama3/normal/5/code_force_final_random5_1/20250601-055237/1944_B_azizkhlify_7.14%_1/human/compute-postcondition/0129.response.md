Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[0]` is being printed twice with a space in between, the value of `a[0]` is being printed**.

In this output state, the value of `ul` has been updated to 2, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `a[0]` is being printed twice with a space in between, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is still 2.
