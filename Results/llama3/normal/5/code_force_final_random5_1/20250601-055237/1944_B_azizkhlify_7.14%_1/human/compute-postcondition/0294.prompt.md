Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - 2 * n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by `n` for `i = n`, `res` is a list containing a single element which is the value of `a[i]` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `res` is an empty list, `re` is `n` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `re` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `ul` is `2 * n`, `ur` is 0. If `k` is not zero, then the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `i`, `ul`, `ur` are updated according to the conditions specified in the if part. If `k` is zero, then the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `i`, `ul`, `ur` remain unchanged, and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - 2 * n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by `n` for `i = n`, `res` is a list containing at least 1 element, `re` is `n` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `re` remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `ul` is `2 * n`, `ur` is 0, and the value of `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - 2 * n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by `n` for `i = n`, `res` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `re` is `n` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `re` remains unchanged, `i` is the second element in the list `res` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `ul` is `2 * n`, `ur` is 0, and the value of `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - 2 * n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by `n` for `i = n`, `res` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `re` is `n` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `re` remains unchanged, `i` is the third element in the list `res` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `ul` is `2 * n`, `ur` is 0, and the value of `i` which is the third element in the list `res` if the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1 and `re` is equal to `k`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
