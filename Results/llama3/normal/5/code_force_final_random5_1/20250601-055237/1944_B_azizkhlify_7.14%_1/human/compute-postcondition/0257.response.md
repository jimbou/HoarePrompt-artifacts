Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - 2 * n`, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, and nothing is printed, `i` is `n`, `ul` is `2 * n`, `ur` is 0. The current value of `k` is not equal to 0. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list `l` is 2 for all i in range(n), then the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between for all i in range(n). If `ul` is equal to `k` multiplied by 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
