The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2, and nothing is printed.**
