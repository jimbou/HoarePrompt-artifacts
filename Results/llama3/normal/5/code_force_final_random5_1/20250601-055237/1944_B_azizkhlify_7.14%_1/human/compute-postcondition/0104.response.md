Postcondition: ***All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `n` is at least 1, `i` is `2 * n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `a[2 * n - 1]` (twice) followed by a space and 2 are printed and `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.***
