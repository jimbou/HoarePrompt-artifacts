Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, and nothing is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1, where `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
