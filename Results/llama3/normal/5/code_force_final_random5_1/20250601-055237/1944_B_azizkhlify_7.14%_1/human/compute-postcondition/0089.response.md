To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`.**
