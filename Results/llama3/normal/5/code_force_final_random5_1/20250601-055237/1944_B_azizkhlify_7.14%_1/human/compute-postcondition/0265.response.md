Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2 * n, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`n`), `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i]` - 1 is incremented by `n` for `i` = `n`, `i` is 0, `ul` is 2 * `n`, `ur` is 0, `re` is equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `i`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged. The value of `re` is still equal to `k`. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains no input, and nothing is printed.
