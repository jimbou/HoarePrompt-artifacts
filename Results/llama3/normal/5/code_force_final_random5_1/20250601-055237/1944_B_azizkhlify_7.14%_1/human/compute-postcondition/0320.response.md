Postcondition: ***The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `i`, `ul`, and `ur` remaining unchanged. The loop has printed all elements in the list `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then the current values of `ul` and `ur` are noted. Otherwise, no additional information is provided.***
