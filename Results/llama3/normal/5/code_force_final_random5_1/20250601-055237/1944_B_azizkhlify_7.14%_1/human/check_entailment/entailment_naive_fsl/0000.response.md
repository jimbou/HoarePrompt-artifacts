Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array `a` contains duplicate elements in the first half that are not present in the second half. In this case, the program will print the same element twice in the first line of output, which is not a valid solution.

For example, if the input is:

```
4
2 1
1 1 2 2
```

The program will output:

```
1 1
2 2
```

Which is not a valid solution because the first line of output should be a subset of the first half of the input array, and the second line of output should be a subset of the second half of the input array.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to keep track of the elements that have been used in the first half of the output and avoid using them again in the second half of the output.
