Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is increased by 2, the list `res` is empty, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and this is printed: `a[i]` which is equal to `a[2 * n]` and `a[i]` which is equal to `a[2 * n]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables except `ur` remain unchanged. The value of `ur` is increased by 2. The list `res` is still empty, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is still 2. Also, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[2 * n]` is printed.
