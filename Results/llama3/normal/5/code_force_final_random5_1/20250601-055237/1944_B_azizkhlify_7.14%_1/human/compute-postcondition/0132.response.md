Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the number of occurrences of `a[0]` in `a` is 2, then the value of `a[0]` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the number of occurrences of `a[0]` in `a` and the printing of `a[0]` is still applicable.
