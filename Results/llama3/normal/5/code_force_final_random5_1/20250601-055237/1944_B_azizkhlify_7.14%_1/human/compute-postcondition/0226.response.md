Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is at least `n`, and nothing is printed.**

The value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `i` is at least `n`, so the loop or if statement we were directly inside has already finished.
