Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state because the break statement does not change any variable values. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
