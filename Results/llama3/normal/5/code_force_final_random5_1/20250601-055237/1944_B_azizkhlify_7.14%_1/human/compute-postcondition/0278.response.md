Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2 * n, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1 and re is equal to k, then res is a list containing a single element which is the value of a[i], re is 3, i is 2, ul is 2 * n, ur is 0. Otherwise, the values of n, k, a, l, r, re, i, ul, ur remain unchanged.***
