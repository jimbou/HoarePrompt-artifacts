Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the number of occurrences of `a[0]` in `a` is 2, then the value of `a[0]` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
