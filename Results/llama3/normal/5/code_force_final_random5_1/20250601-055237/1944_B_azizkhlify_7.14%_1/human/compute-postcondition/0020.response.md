Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 1 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, 2 * `n`) and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0, the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and this is printed: the value of `a[i]` which is `a[0]` and the value of `a[i]` which is `a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ul` has been updated to 2, and all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is still 2. The value of `a[i]` which is `a[0]` has been printed twice.
