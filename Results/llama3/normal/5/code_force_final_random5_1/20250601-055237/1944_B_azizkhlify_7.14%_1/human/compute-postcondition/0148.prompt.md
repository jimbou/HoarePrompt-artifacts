Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `r` will contain the count of each integer in `a`, where `r[a[i] - 1]` represents the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the number of occurrences of `a[0]` in `a` is 2, then the value of `a[0]` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If `ul` equals `k` times 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `ul` is equal to `k` times 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the number of occurrences of the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is 2, then `ul` is equal to `k` times 2 plus 2 and the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is printed twice. Otherwise, `ul` remains equal to `k` times 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
