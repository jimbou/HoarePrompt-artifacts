Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ur` and nothing is printed. In either case, the list `res` remains empty.***
