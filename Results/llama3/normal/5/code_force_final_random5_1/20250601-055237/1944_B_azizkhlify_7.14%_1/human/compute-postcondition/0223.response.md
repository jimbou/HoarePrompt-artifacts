Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[2] - 1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2, and nothing is printed.**

In this output state, the value at index `a[2] - 1` in list `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
