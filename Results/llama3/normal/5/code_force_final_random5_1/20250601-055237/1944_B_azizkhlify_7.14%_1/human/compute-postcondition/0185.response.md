The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the third element in the list `res` followed by a space.
Since the exact `res` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third element of the `res` list followed by a space.
Output: **the third element of the list res (followed by a space)**
