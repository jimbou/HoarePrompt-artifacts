Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged, `ul` is either equal to `ur` or not equal to `ur`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The list `res` remains empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same as before, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The list `res` is still empty.
