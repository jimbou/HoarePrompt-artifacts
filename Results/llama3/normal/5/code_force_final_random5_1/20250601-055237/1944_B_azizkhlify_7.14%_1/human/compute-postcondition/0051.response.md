The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is a non-zero integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, ul is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[i], and i is 1.**
