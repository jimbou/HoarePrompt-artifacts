Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 2, `ur` was increased by 2, and `a[i]` which was equal to 2 was printed twice, followed by a space. Otherwise, nothing was printed. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `a[n+1]` (twice) followed by a space and 2 are printed. If `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing additional is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 2`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `a[n+2]` (twice) followed by a space and 2 are printed and `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
