Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2 * n, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, then res is a list containing a single element which is the value of a[i], re is 1, i is 0, ul is 2 * n, ur is 0, stdin contains no input, and nothing is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
