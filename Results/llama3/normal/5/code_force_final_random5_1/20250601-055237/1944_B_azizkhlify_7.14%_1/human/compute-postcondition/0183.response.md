Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `re` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the second element in the list `res`, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and all elements of the list `a` which are `a[i]` have been printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and nothing is printed, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is printed, and the second element of the list `res` which is `i` is printed followed by a space**
