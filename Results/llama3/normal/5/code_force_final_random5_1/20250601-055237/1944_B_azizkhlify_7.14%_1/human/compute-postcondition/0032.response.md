State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 1 for all `i` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is 1 for all `i` in range(`n`, 2 * `n`) and the rest are 0, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4 if the value of `l[a[0] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2**
