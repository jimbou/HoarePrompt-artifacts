Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to `2 * k - 2 * n`, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), `r` is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, and nothing is printed, `i` is `n`, `ul` is `2 * n`, `ur` is 0. The current value of `k` is not equal to 0. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list `l` is 2 for all i in range(n), then the value of `a[i]` is printed twice with a space in between for all i in range(n). If `ul` is equal to `k` multiplied by 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2 * n, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1, then res is a list containing a single element which is the value of a[i], re is 1, i is 0, ul is 2 * n, ur is 0, stdin contains no input, and nothing is printed. If re is equal to k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2 * n, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1 and re is equal to k, then res is a list containing a single element which is the value of a[i], re is 2, i is 1, ul is 2 * n, ur is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - 2 * n, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for all i in range(n), r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by n for i = n. If the value at index a[i] - 1 in list l is 1 and re is equal to k, then res is a list containing a single element which is the value of a[i], re is 3, i is 2, ul is 2 * n, ur is 0. Otherwise, the values of n, k, a, l, r, re, i, ul, ur remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
