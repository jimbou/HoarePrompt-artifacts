To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
