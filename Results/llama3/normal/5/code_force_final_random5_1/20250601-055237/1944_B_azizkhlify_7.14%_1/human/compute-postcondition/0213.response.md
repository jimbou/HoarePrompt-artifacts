Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` equals `ur`, `ur` is a multiple of 2, `res` is a list containing all elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a`, `re` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the last element in the list `res` plus a multiple of the number of times the loop executes, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and all elements of the list `a` which are `a[i]` have been printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and nothing is printed, and all elements of the list `res` which is `i` are printed followed by a space, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the last element of the list `res` which is `a[i]` is printed twice followed by a space, and if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then the last element of the list `res` which is `a[i]` is printed twice followed by a space.**
