Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the value at index `a[0] - 1` is 1 and the value at index `a[1] - 1` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
