Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `n` is at least 1, `i` is `2 * n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `a[2 * n - 1]` (twice) followed by a space and 2 are printed and `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing, and a newline character is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` equals `ur`, `ur` is a multiple of 2, `res` is a list containing all elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a`, `re` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the last element in the list `res` plus a multiple of the number of times the loop executes, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and all elements of the list `a` which are `a[i]` have been printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and nothing is printed, and all elements of the list `res` which is `i` are printed followed by a space, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the last element of the list `res` which is `a[i]` is printed twice followed by a space, and if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then the last element of the list `res` which is `a[i]` is printed twice followed by a space, and a new line is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `i`, `ul`, and `ur` remaining unchanged. The loop has printed all elements in the list `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then the current values of `ul` and `ur` are noted. Otherwise, no additional information is provided, and a blank line is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
