Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged, `ul` is either equal to `ur` or not equal to `ur`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and `a[i]` which is equal to `a[2 * n]` is printed twice. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ur` and nothing is printed. In either case, the list `res` remains empty.***
