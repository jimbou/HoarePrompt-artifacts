To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n`. Since the loop has executed all iterations and the output state is the same as the initial state, it means the loop has completed successfully.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and the list `res` is empty**
