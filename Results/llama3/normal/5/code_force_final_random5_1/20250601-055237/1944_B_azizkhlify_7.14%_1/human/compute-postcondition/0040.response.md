Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 2 * k - min(n * 2, k * 2), a is a list of integers, l is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the value at index a[i] - 1 is 1 for all i in range(n, 2 * n) and the rest are 0, re is 0, ul is equal to the minimum of n * 2 and k * 2, ur is 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated pair of integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is equal to the minimum of n and k.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to be equal to 2 times its original value minus the minimum of n times 2 and k times 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
