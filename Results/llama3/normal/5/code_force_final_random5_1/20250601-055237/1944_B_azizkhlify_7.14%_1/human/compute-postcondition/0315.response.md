Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged, `res` is an empty list, `ur` is increased by 2, and the value of `a` at index `i` which is `a[2*n]` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain unchanged except for `ur`, which is increased by 2. The value of `a` at index `i` (which is equal to `2 * n`) is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. The rest of the variables retain their initial values.
