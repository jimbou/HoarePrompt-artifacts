According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1 and `i` is now `n`.
State: **All elements in the list `res` have been printed, followed by a space after each element, and nothing else is printed, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`**
