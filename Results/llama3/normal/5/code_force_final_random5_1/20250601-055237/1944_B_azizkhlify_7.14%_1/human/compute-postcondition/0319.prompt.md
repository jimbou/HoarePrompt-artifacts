Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `i`, `ul`, and `ur` remaining unchanged. The loop has printed all elements in the list `res`. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged, `ul` is either equal to `ur` or not equal to `ur`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and `a[i]` which is equal to `a[2 * n]` is printed twice. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ur` and nothing is printed. In either case, the list `res` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `2 * n + 1`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ur` and nothing is printed. In either case, the list `res` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged, `res` is an empty list. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
