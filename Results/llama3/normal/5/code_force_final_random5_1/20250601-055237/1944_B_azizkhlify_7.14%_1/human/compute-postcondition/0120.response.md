Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 and the rest are 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `r[a[i] - 1]` being 2, while the rest of the elements in `r` remain 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
