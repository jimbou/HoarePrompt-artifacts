The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Here, `i` is 2, and `a` is a list of `n` integers.

Since `i` is 2, we are looking at the third element of the list `a` (because indexing starts at 0). The value of this element is `a[2]`.

So, the code will print the value of `a[2]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list a)**
