Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n` and the rest are 1, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the number of occurrences of the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is 2, then `ul` is equal to `k` times 2 plus 2 and the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is printed twice. Otherwise, `ul` remains equal to `k` times 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the loop or if statement we were directly inside.
