Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing all elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a`, `re` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the last element in the list `res`, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and all elements of the list `a` which are `a[i]` have been printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and nothing is printed, and all elements of the list `res` which is `i` are printed followed by a space.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` equals `ur` or `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is 0 or 2, `res` is a list containing all elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a`, `re` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the last element in the list `res`, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and all elements of the list `a` which are `a[i]` have been printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and nothing is printed, and all elements of the list `res` which is `i` are printed followed by a space, `i` is `n`, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the last element of the list `res` which is `a[i]` is printed twice followed by a space, and if `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` equals `ur` or `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is 0 or 2, `res` is a list containing all elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a`, `re` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the last element in the list `res` plus 1, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and all elements of the list `a` which are `a[i]` have been printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and nothing is printed, and all elements of the list `res` which is `i` are printed followed by a space, `i` is `n` plus 1, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the last element of the list `res` which is `a[i]` is printed twice followed by a space. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` and the rest are 1, `ul` equals `ur` or `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is 2 or 4, `res` is a list containing all elements of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a`, `re` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n` plus 2, `k` is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and all elements of the list `a` which are `a[i]` have been printed if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and nothing is printed, and all elements of the list `res` which is `i` are printed followed by a space, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the last element of the list `res` which is `a[i]` is printed twice followed by a space. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
