The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `i` is equal to `2 * n` and `n` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2. The value of `a[i]` is not explicitly provided, but it is used as an index to access the list `r`. The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, which implies that `a[i]` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

However, the exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of the list `a`. Therefore, the output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the value of the element at index i in the list a)**
