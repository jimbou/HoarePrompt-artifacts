Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, and `ul` remain unchanged, `res` is an empty list. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2, and the value of `a` at index `i` which is `a[2*n]` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
