Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is the number of occurrences of a[i] in a and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is the number of occurrences of a[i] in a and the rest are 1, if l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then re is 1, ul is 0, ur is 0, res is a list containing the first element of a, stdin contains no input, i is 0, k is 2 times its original value minus 0 and is not equal to 0, and the first element of the list a which is a[0] has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made. The current value of re is equal to k***
