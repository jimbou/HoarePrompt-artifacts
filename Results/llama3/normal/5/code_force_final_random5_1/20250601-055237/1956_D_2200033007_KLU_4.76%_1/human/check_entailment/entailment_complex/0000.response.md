Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not actually calculate the maximum sum of the elements of the array `a` or construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. Instead, it simply prints a hardcoded message based on the value of the input list `c`. This message does not take into account the actual values of the elements in the array `a`.

The program also does not handle the case where the input list `c` is not equal to 2 or the case where the length of the input list `c` is not 2. In these cases, the program will not print the correct maximum sum or sequence of operations.

Furthermore, the program does not use the input values of the array `a` at all. It only uses the length of the array `a` to call the function `func_1`, but the function `func_1` does not use the actual values of the elements in the array `a`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
