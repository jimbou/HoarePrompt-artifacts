Reasoning:

The given program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array is 2 and when the length of the array is 3 (with a specific set of values). It does not provide a general solution for arrays of any length.

2. The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array as an argument, but it does not use this information to calculate the maximum sum or generate the sequence of operations.

3. The program does not read the input array correctly. It reads the entire line of input as a string, splits it into substrings, and then appends these substrings to the array `a`. However, it does not convert these substrings to integers, so the array `a` contains strings, not integers.

4. The program does not calculate the maximum sum of the array or generate the sequence of operations. It simply prints hardcoded values for the maximum sum and the number of operations.

5. The program does not follow the problem's requirements. It is supposed to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing a sequence of operations, but it does not do this.

Correctness: **False**
