Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the input list is 2, it prints '4 1' and '1 2', and when the length of the input list is not 2, it prints '13 0'. However, the problem statement requires the program to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing a specific operation, and the program does not attempt to do this. It does not even use the input values, it only uses the length of the input list. The program also does not follow the required output format, which should include the maximum sum of elements and the number of operations, followed by the parameters of each operation.

Correctness: **False**
