Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the array is 2 or 3, and it does not provide a general solution for arrays of any length. For example, if the input is an array of length 4, the program will not produce the correct output.

The program also does not follow the problem description, which requires the program to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing a sequence of operations, and to output the maximum sum and the number of operations. The program only prints a fixed output for the cases where the length of the array is 2 or 3, and it does not provide any explanation or justification for why this output is correct.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to implement a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal sequence of operations that maximizes the sum of the elements of the array. The program would also need to output the correct maximum sum and the number of operations for each input case.
