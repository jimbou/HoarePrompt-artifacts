#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of n non-negative integers, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18.
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: *`c` is a list of n non-negative integers, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18, `m` is 0. If the current value of `c` is 2, then '1 2' is printed. Otherwise, '13 0' is printed.
    return
    #The program returns None. The list 'c' contains n non-negative integers, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18. The value of 'm' is 0. If the current value of 'c' is 2, then '1 2' is printed. Otherwise, '13 0' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints a specific message based on the value of the input list. If the input list is equal to 2, it prints '1 2'. Otherwise, it prints '13 0'. The function does not modify the input list or return any value. It only prints a message to the console.
