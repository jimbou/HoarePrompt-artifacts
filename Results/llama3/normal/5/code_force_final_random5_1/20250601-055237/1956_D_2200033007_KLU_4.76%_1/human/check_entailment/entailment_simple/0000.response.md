Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the input list `c` is 2, and prints a fixed output for this case. For all other cases, it prints a fixed output regardless of the actual values in the list. This does not correctly solve the problem, which requires finding the maximum sum of the elements of the array and constructing a sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

The function does not perform any actual computation or processing of the input list, and does not generate a correct output for the problem. The output is hardcoded and does not depend on the input values.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
