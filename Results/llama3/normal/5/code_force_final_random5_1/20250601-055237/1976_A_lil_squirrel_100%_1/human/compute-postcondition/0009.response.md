Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, `letters` contains the first character of the password and the character `ch`, `digits` is empty if the first character of the password is not a digit, otherwise `digits` contains the first character of the password and is empty after that.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The `password` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The list `letters` now contains the first character of the password and the character `ch` that was appended to it. The list `digits` is empty if the first character of the password is not a digit, otherwise it contains the first character of the password and is empty after that.
