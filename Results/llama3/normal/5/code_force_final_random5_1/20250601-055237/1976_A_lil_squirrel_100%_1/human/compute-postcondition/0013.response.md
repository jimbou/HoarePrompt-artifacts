Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the original password was a digit, then the list `digits` contains this digit and at least one more character and the list `letters` contains the character `ch`. If the first character of the original password was not a digit, then the list `letters` contains the first character of the original password and the character `ch`, and `digits` is empty if the first character of the original password is not a digit, otherwise `digits` contains the first character of the original password and is empty after that.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `password` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `letters` now contains the character `ch` in addition to its previous contents. The list `digits` remains the same as in the initial state.
