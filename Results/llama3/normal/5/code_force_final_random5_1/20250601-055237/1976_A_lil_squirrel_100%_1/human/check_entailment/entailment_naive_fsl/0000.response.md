Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if there are no digits after letters, if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, and if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program first separates the letters and digits into two lists and checks if they are sorted. If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it returns 'NO'. Then, it checks if there are any digits after letters in the password. If it finds any, it returns 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement. It also handles cases where the password has only letters or only digits, as well as cases where the password is empty or has a length of 1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.
