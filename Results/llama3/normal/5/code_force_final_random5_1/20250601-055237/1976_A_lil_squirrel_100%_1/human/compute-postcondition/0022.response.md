To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(password) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `len(password) - 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `len(password)` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 2 characters, `letters` is a list of all lowercase Latin letters from the original password, `digits` is a list of all digits from the original password, the list of letters is sorted in ascending order, and the list of digits is sorted in ascending order, `i` is 0**
