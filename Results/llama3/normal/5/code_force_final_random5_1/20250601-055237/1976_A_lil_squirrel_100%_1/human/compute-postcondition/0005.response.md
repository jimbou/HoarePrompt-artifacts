Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`, `digits` is an empty list, and `ch` is the first character in the password, and `ch` is not a digit**

In this output state, the list `letters` now contains the first character of the password, which is a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, but since `ch` is not a digit, it is a lowercase Latin letter. The other variables remain unchanged.
