Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks all the conditions specified in the problem description. 

1. It checks if the letters in the password are in ascending order by comparing the list of letters with its sorted version.
2. It checks if the digits in the password are in ascending order by comparing the list of digits with its sorted version.
3. It checks if any letter is immediately followed by a digit by iterating over the password and checking if the current character is a letter and the next character is a digit.

If any of these conditions are not met, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
