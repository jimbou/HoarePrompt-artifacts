Output State: **n is a positive integer, password is a string with at least 2 characters, letters is a list of all lowercase Latin letters from the original password, digits is a list of all digits from the original password, the list of letters is sorted in ascending order, and the list of digits is sorted in ascending order, i is equal to the length of password minus 1. If the character at index i in password is a letter and the character at index i + 1 is a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has checked all pairs of adjacent characters in the password. If any pair consists of a letter followed by a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function does not return 'NO' and the loop completes normally. The values of n, password, letters, and digits remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
