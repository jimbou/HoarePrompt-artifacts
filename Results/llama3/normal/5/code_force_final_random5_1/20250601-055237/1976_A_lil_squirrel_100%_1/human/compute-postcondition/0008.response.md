Output State: **n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters. If the first character of the password is a digit, then the list `digits` contains this digit and at least one more character and the list `letters` is empty. If the first character of the password is not a digit, then the list `letters` contains this character and the list `digits` contains at least one character.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state. The password also remains the same. The list `digits` now contains at least one more character than it did in the initial state, and the list `letters` remains the same.
