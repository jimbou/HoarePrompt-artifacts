Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the original password was a digit, then the list `digits` contains this digit, at least one more character and the character `ch`, and the list `letters` is empty. If the first character of the original password was not a digit, then the list `letters` contains the first character of the original password and the character `ch`, and `digits` contains the first character of the original password and the character `ch` if the first character of the original password is a digit, otherwise `digits` contains the character `ch` and is empty after that.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `n` and `password` remains the same. The list `digits` now contains the character `ch` in addition to its previous contents. If the first character of the original password was a digit, `digits` now contains at least two characters, including the first character of the original password and `ch`. If the first character of the original password was not a digit, `digits` now contains the first character of the original password and `ch` if the first character of the original password is a digit, otherwise `digits` contains only the character `ch`. The list `letters` remains the same, containing the first character of the original password and `ch` if the first character of the original password was not a digit.
