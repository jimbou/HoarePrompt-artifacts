Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` which is a digit, `ch` is the first character in the password and is a digit.**

In this output state, the code has appended the first character of the password, which is a digit, to the list `digits`. The other variables remain unchanged. The password still has a length of `n` and consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with at least one character. The list `letters` is still empty, and the variable `ch` still holds the value of the first character in the password, which is a digit.
