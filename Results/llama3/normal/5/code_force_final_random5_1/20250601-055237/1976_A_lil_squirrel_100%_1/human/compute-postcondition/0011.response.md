To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for ch in password:`. This means that the loop will iterate over each character in the `password` string. Since we are given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that the first character of the `password` has already been processed.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. `password`: Since the first character has already been processed, the `password` string should be updated to remove the first character. This means that the length of the `password` string should decrease by 1.
2. `ch`: Since the loop is iterating over each character in the `password` string, the value of `ch` should be updated to the next character in the string.
3. `digits` and `letters`: The state of these lists depends on the first character of the `password`. If the first character is a digit, then `digits` should contain this digit and at least one more character, and `letters` should be empty. If the first character is not a digit, then `letters` should contain the first character and the character `ch`, and `digits` should be empty.

Based on these considerations, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the original password was a digit, then the list `digits` contains this digit and at least one more character and the list `letters` is empty. If the first character of the original password was not a digit, then the list `letters` contains the first character of the original password and the character `ch`, and `digits` is empty if the first character of the original password is not a digit, otherwise `digits` contains the first character of the original password and is empty after that.**

Note that the state of `ch` is not explicitly mentioned, as it is not a variable that is being tracked in the state. However, it is implied that `ch` will take on the value of the next character in the `password` string.
