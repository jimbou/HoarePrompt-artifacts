Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is a positive integer, password is an empty string, letters is a list of all lowercase Latin letters from the original password, digits is a list of all digits from the original password, the list of letters is sorted in ascending order, and the list of digits is sorted in ascending order
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(password) - 1):
    if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 2 characters, `letters` is a list of all lowercase Latin letters from the original password, `digits` is a list of all digits from the original password, the list of letters is sorted in ascending order, and the list of digits is sorted in ascending order, `i` is 0. Either `password[i]` is not a letter, or `password[i + 1]` is not a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 3 characters, `letters` is a list of all lowercase Latin letters from the original password, `digits` is a list of all digits from the original password, the list of letters is sorted in ascending order, and the list of digits is sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1. If `password[i]` is a letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 3 characters, `letters` is a list of all lowercase Latin letters from the original password, `digits` is a list of all digits from the original password, the list of letters is sorted in ascending order, and the list of digits is sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `password` is a letter and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
