Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is an empty list, digits is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isdigit():
        digits.append(ch)
    else:
        letters.append(ch)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the password is a digit, then the list `digits` contains this digit and the list `letters` is empty. If the first character of the password is not a digit, then the list `letters` contains this character and the list `digits` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters. If the first character of the password is a digit, then the list `digits` contains this digit and at least one more character and the list `letters` is empty. If the first character of the password is not a digit, then the list `letters` contains the first character of the password and the character `ch`, and `digits` is empty if the first character of the password is not a digit, otherwise `digits` contains the first character of the password and is empty after that.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the original password was a digit, then the list `digits` contains this digit and at least one more character. If the first character of the original password was not a digit, then the list `letters` contains the first character of the original password. The character `ch` is added to the list `digits` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise it is added to the list `letters`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
