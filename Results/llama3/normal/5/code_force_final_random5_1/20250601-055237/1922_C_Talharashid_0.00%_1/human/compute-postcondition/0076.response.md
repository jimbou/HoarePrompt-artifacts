Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is at least 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is equal to the second input minus 1, inc is -1, start is equal to the first input minus 1, d2 has a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of start and the value is s, s is 0, m must be greater than 0, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `end` is updated to be the second input minus 1, and the value of `start` is updated to be the first input minus 1. The dictionary `d2` now has a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, which is 0. The value of `s` is also 0. The stdin is empty as it has been used to read the inputs.
