Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is 0, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to the length of lst minus 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value, s is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is 0, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to the length of lst minus 2, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, d2[start] is s.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is 0, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to the length of lst minus 3, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is incremented by 1. Otherwise, s is incremented by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1]. d2[start] is s if start + 1 is less than the length of lst. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is 0, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is not equal to 0 and not equal to the length of lst minus 3, start is incremented by inc, d2[start] is s if start + 1 is less than the length of lst.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
