Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m` + 1, `i` is equal to `m` + 1, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer, `start` is the current start index plus 1 and must be less than the last index of `lst` minus 1. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, then `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, the previous value of `s`, and the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`. `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111, if `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111. If `start` - 1 is greater than -1, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
