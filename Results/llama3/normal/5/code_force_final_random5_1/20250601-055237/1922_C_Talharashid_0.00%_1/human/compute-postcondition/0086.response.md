Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is at least 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is an integer, end is an integer, inc is -1, s is 0, m must be greater than 1, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences from end index and start index in d1, s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences from start index and end index in d2, and stdin contains no input.**

In this final state, the values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the differences between the values in dictionaries `d1` and `d2` at the specified indices `start` and `end`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial properties and values as described in the precondition.
