Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is at least 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is an integer, end is an integer, inc is -1, s is 0, m must be greater than 1, and stdin contains no input.**

The code block does not modify any of the variables from the initial state, except for `start` and `end`, which are assigned new values based on the input. The `start` and `end` variables are decremented by 1, and `s` is initialized to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
