Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is equal to 0, inc is -1, start is equal to the last index of lst minus 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the previous value of mini, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the previous value of s.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is -1, effectively decrementing `start` by 1. Then, it assigns the value of `s` to `d2[start]`, adding a new key-value pair to the dictionary `d2`. The value of `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`. The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
