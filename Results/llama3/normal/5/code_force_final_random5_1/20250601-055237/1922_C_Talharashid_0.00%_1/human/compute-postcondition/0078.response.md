Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is at least 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is equal to the second input minus 1, inc is -1, start is equal to the first input minus 1, d2 has a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of start and the value is s, s is 0, m must be greater than 0, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the indices end and start, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the indices start and end, and stdin contains no input. The current value of start is less than the current value of end.**

In this output state, the values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the absolute differences between the values of `d1` and `d2` at the indices `end` and `start`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
