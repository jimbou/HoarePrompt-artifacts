Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 2`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst`, `d2` has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers and the length of `lst` must be greater than 1, `end` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `start` is either 0 or greater than -1 and is equal to its previous value plus `inc` and must be less than `end`, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is either 1 or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start + 1` indices of `lst` and its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
