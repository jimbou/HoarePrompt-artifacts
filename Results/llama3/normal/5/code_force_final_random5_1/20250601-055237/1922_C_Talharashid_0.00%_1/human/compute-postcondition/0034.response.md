Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is `start+1` and the value is `s+1` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`, otherwise the value is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least one element, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `start` must be less than `end`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous value of `mini` and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, stdin contains no input. If `start - 1 > -1`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been increased by the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start + inc` in the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
