To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, to make it explicit, we can adjust the state to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
