Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is `start+1` and the value is `s+2` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and `mini` equals to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s + 1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s+1` if `mini` equals to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s`, and the key is `start` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least one element, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `start` is increased by `inc`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous value of `mini` and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged, `s` is increased by 1 if `mini` equals to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, stdin contains no input.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is 1, and adds a new key-value pair to dictionary `d1` where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is the current value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
