Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is an empty dictionary, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers, start is 0, end is equal to the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, s is 0, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is equal to the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is either 0 or greater than -1 and is equal to its previous value plus inc, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and 11111111, s is either 1 or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and its previous value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s or s + 1, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s or s + 1, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is equal to the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is either 0 or greater than -1 and is equal to its previous value plus inc and must be less than end. If start + 1 is less than the length of lst, then mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and 11111111, and s is either 1 or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and its previous value, or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and its previous value plus 1, or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and its previous value plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and 11111111, and s is either 1 or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value, or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value plus 1, or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
