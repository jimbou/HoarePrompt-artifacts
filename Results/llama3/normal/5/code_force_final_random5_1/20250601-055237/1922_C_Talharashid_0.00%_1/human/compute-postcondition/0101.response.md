To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `start != end`. The loop will execute if `start` is not equal to `end`. Given the initial states:

- `start` is 0
- `end` is the last index of `lst`

Since `lst` must have at least two elements, the last index (`end`) will always be greater than or equal to 1 (considering 0-based indexing). Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `start` (which is 0) and `end` (which is the last index of `lst`) must not be equal.

Given that `start` is fixed at 0 and `end` is determined by the length of `lst`, we need to ensure that `lst` has more than one element to guarantee that `start` and `end` are not equal. This condition is already met by the statement that `lst` must have at least two elements.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed to the states of `start` and `end` for the loop to execute the first time, as the given conditions already ensure that `start != end` will be true for the first iteration.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is 0, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, s is 0, m is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**
