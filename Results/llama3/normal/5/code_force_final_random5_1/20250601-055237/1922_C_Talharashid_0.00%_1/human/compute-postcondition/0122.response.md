Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer, `start` is the current start index plus 1 and must be less than `end`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and the previous value of `mini`, and `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`.**

The code increments the value of `s` by the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
