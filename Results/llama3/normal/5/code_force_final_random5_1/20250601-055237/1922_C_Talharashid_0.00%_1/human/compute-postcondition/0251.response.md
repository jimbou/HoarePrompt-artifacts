According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is equal to the length of lst minus 2 and end is 0. Since start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is 0, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to the length of lst minus 2, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, d2[start] is s**
