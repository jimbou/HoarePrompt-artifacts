The variables in the loop head are `start` and `end`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is not equal to `end`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to `start - 1` and `end` is equal to 0. `start` being equal to `start - 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `start` is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer, `start` is not equal to 0, `s` is equal to the previous value of `s` plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`, otherwise `s` is equal to 1.**
