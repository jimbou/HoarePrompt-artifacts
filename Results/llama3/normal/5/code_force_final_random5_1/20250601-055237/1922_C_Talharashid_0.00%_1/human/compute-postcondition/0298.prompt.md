Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains a series of test cases, each test case consists of three parts: the first part is an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5), the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9), and the third part is a list of m queries (1 <= m <= 10^5), where each query is a pair of integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    start = 0
    end = len(lst) - 1
    inc = 1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d1[start] = s
    start = len(lst) - 1
    end = 0
    inc = -1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d2[start] = s
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        start, end = map(int, input().split())
        start -= 1
        end -= 1
        s = 0
        if start < end:
            s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
            s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
        else:
            s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
            s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
        print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is equal to m, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, end is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer, and stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences from end index and start index in d1, and s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences from start index and end index in d2. If start is not less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is equal to the value of start from the input minus 1, end is equal to the value of end from the input minus 1, inc is equal to -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, s is 0, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the end index and the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the end and end - 1 indices of lst. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.

If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end indices. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices. The minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
