Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is 0, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, d2[start] is s.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has traversed the entire list from the end to the beginning, updating the `d2` dictionary with the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`. The `start` variable has reached 0, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The `mini` variable holds the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and its previous value. The `s` variable holds the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + `inc` indices of `lst` and its previous value. The `d2` dictionary contains the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` for each index in the list.
