Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is equal to the value of start from the input minus 1, end is equal to the value of end from the input minus 1, inc is equal to -1, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, s is 0, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end indices, stdin contains no inputs.**
