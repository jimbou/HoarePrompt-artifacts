Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains a series of test cases, each test case consists of three parts: the first part is an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5), the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9), and the third part is a list of m queries (1 <= m <= 10^5), where each query is a pair of integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains a series of test cases, but the first part of each test case (the integer t) has been consumed by the input operation. The remaining parts of each test case, including the integer n, the list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and the list of m queries, are still present in the stdin.
