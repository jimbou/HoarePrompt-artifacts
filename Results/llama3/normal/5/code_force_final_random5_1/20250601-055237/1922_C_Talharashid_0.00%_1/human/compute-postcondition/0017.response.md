According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is greater than 1 and less than the second last index of lst, start is updated and mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between the current and previous elements of lst. Otherwise, no changes are made. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between the current and next elements of lst at index start, then s is 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index. So for the loop to be executed one more time start must be less than end.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is start+1 and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst must have at least one element, end is the last index of lst and must be greater than 0, inc is 1, stdin contains no input, start must be less than end**
