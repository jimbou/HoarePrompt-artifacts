Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is at least 3, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is an integer equal to start - 1, end is an integer equal to end - 1, inc is -1, s is 0, m must be greater than 2, and stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the end index and the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, and s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst starting from the start index and the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst starting from the end index. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices.**
