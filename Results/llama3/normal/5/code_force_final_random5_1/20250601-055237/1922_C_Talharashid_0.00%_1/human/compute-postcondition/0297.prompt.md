Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 2`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers and the length of `lst` must be greater than 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `start` is equal to 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is an integer, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, start is an integer, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is 0, and stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at index end and the value of d1 at index start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at index start and the value of d2 at index end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between d2[end] and d2[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d1[start] and d1[end]. The minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, start is an integer, end is an integer, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is 0, stdin contains no input, start is an integer and is equal to the first input minus 1, end is an integer and is equal to the second input minus 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end indices. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices. The minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, start is an integer and is equal to the first input minus 2, end is an integer and is equal to the second input minus 1, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is 0. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end indices. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices. The minimum of s1 and s2 is printed, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
