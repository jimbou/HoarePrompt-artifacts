Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `start` is 0, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `m` is an integer, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`, and stdin contains no input. The current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
