Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is an integer, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, start is an integer, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is 0, and stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at index end and the value of d1 at index start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at index start and the value of d2 at index end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between d2[end] and d2[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d1[start] and d1[end].**
