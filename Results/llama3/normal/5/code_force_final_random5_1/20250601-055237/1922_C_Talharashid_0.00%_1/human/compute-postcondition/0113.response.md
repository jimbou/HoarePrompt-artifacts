Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer. If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst`. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start + inc` indices of `lst`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current `start` and `start + inc` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`.***
