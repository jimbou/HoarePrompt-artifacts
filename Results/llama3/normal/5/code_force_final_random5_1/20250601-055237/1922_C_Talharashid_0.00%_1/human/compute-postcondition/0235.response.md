Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is equal to the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value, s is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and the variables have reached their final values. The variable `start` has reached the value of `end`, which means the loop has iterated over the entire list `lst`. The variable `s` has accumulated the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` have been populated with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
