Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is equal to the value of start from the input minus 1, end is equal to the value of end from the input minus 1, inc is equal to -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, s is 0, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the end index and the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the end and end - 1 indices of lst. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `i` is now equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has executed `m` times. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` have been updated with the new values of `start` and `end` from the input, and the variable `s` has been reset to 0. The conditions for `s1` and `s2` remain the same as before, and the minimum of `s1` and `s2` is printed after each iteration.
