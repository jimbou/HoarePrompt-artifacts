The code prints the minimum of the absolute differences between the values of dictionaries d1 and d2 at the start and end indices of the list lst.

Since the exact values of start, end, d1, and d2 are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the minimum absolute difference. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum absolute difference between the values of d1 and d2 at the start and end indices of lst.

Output: **minimum absolute difference between the values of d1 and d2 at the start and end indices of lst**
