To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is equal to `m + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to 0, which is the starting value of the range. We also need to adjust `m` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `start` is equal to `end`, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` for all iterations, `d2` has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s` for all iterations**
