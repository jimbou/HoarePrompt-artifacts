Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is an empty dictionary, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers, start is 0, end is equal to the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, s is 0, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s.**

The code initializes two empty dictionaries, d1 and d2, and assigns the value of the input to n. It then assigns a list of integers from the input to lst. The start index is set to 0, and the end index is set to the length of lst minus 1. The inc variable is set to 1, and the s variable is set to 0. The d2 dictionary is updated with additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s. The rest of the variables, t, i, m, remain unchanged.
