Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer, `start` is equal to `end`, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` for all indices from the initial value of `start` to `end`, `d2` has additional key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` for all indices from the initial value of `start` to `end`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all indices of the list `lst` from the initial value of `start` to `end`, updating the dictionary `d2` with the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` for each index. The variable `s` now holds the total sum of these absolute differences. The other variables remain unchanged.
