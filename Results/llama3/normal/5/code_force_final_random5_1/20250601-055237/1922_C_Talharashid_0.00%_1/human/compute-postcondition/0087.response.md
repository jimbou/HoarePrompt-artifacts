Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is at least 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is an integer, end is an integer, inc is -1, s is 0, m must be greater than 1, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the differences between the values of `d2` and `d1` at specific indices. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
