Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is greater than 0 and is equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `start` is decremented by 1, `d2` has a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, `start` must be greater than 0, and `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1` is greater than -1. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111, and `s` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
