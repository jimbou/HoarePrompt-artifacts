Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 2`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers and the length of `lst` must be greater than 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `start` is equal to 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `m` has been updated to the integer input from the user, and `i` is now equal to the new value of `m` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin is now empty since it has been used to input the value of `m`.
