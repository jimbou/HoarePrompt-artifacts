Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer, `start` is not equal to 0, `s` is equal to the previous value of `s` plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`, otherwise `s` is equal to 1, `mini` is equal to the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111 if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains equal to 11111111.**
