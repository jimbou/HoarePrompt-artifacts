Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer, start is equal to end, s is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and the previous value of s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst, otherwise s is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst, the previous value of s, and the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and 11111111, if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini remains 11111111.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The variable `start` has reached the value of `end`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The variable `s` has accumulated the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`, plus 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, the previous value of `s`, and the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`. The variable `mini` has reached its final value, which is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111, if `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
