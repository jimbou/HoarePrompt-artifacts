Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is equal to 0, inc is -1, start is equal to 0, d2 has a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of start and the value is s, s is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, m is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of t, i, d1, d2, n, lst, end, inc, start, and s remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of a new variable m, which is assigned an integer value from the input. Since the input is consumed, stdin is now empty.
