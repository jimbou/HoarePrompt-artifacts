This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t, an integer n, a list of n integers, and a list of m queries. For each test case, it calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between elements in the list for each query, and prints the result. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
