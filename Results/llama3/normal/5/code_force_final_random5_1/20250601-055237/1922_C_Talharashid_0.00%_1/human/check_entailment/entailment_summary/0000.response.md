Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cities, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries. For each query, it calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences between elements in the list and prints the result.

The program uses two dictionaries, d1 and d2, to store the cumulative sum of absolute differences between elements in the list when moving from left to right and right to left, respectively. It then uses these dictionaries to calculate the minimum sum of absolute differences for each query.

The program correctly handles the case where the start city is less than the end city and the case where the start city is greater than the end city. It also correctly calculates the minimum sum of absolute differences by taking the minimum of the two possible paths.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
