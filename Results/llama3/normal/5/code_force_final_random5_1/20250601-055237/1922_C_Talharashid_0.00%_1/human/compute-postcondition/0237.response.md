To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition `start != end` and adjust the states of `start` and `end` if necessary.

Given the initial states:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 2`
* `i` is equal to `m + 1`
* `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`
* `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`
* `n` is an integer
* `lst` is a list of integers and the length of `lst` must be greater than 1
* `end` is 0
* `inc` is -1
* `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0
* `start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1
* `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and its previous value
* `s` is 0

The loop condition `start != end` depends on the values of `start` and `end`. Since `end` is 0, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to 0.

Given that `start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1, we can conclude that the length of `lst` must be greater than 1 to ensure `start` is not equal to 0.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the length of `lst` is greater than 1, which is already stated in the initial state.
