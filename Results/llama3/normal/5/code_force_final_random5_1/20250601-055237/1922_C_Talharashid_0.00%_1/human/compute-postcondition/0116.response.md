Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer, `start` is the current start index plus 1 and must be less than `end`, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, with `t` being greater than `m + 1`, `i` being equal to `m + 1`, and `start` being less than `end`. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` maintain their key-value pairs, and the list `lst` still has at least two elements.
