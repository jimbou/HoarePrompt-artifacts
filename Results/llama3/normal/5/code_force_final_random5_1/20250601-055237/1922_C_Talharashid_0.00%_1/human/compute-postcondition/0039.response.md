To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to examine the condition `start != end`. Since `start` is equal to the second last index of `lst` and `end` is equal to 0, we need to adjust the state of `lst` to ensure that it has at least two elements. This is because if `lst` has only one element, `start` would be equal to 0 (the only index), and the loop condition would not be met.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is equal to the second last index of lst, end is equal to 0, inc is -1, s is 0, stdin contains no input.**
