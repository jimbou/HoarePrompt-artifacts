Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst must have at least one element, end is the last index of lst and must be greater than 0, inc is 1, start is equal to end, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the dictionary `d1` will contain key-value pairs where the key is the index of the list `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index. The loop will continue to execute until the `start` index is equal to the `end` index, at which point the loop will terminate. The other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged.
