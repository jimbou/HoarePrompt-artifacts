Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is an empty dictionary, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers, start is 0, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, s is 0, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is start+1 and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst must have at least one element, end is the last index of lst and must be greater than 0, inc is 1, stdin contains no input. If start is greater than 1 and less than the second last index of lst, start is updated and mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between the current and previous elements of lst. Otherwise, no changes are made. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between the current and next elements of lst at index start, then s is 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is start+1 and the value is s+1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst, otherwise the value is s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), and the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst must have at least one element, end is the last index of lst and must be greater than 0, inc is 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the previous value of mini if start + 1 < len(lst), otherwise mini remains the same, stdin contains no input, start is the updated index which is start+inc and must be less than or equal to end.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is `start+1` and the value is `s+2` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and `mini` equals to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s + 1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s+1` if `mini` equals to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s`, and the key is `start` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least one element, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `start` is increased by `inc`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous value of `mini` and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged, `s` is increased by 1 if `mini` equals to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, stdin contains no input.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
