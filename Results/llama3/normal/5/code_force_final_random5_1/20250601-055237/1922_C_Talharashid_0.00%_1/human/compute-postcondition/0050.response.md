Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`. If `start` is greater than 1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `start` is equal to the last index of `lst` and `mini` is 11111111. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now the sum of its previous value and the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst`.
