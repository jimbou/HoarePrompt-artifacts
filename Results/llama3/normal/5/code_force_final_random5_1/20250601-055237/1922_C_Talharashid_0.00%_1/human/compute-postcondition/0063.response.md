The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is greater than 0 and is equal to the last index of lst minus 1, start is decremented by 1 and end is equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time start must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is greater than 0 and is equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `start` is decremented by 1, `d2` has a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s` and `start` must be greater than 0**
