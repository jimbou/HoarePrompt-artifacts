Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 2`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers and the length of `lst` must be greater than 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `start` is not equal to 0 and not equal to the length of `lst` minus 3. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. `d2[start]` is `s` if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
