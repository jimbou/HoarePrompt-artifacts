The code prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2`. 

`s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the values of `start` and `end`. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the `end` index and the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the `start` index. `s2` is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst` and the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the `end` and `end - 1` indices of `lst`. 

If `start` is not less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between the values of `d2` at `end` and `start` indices, and `s2` is the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at `start` and `end` indices.

Since the exact values of `lst`, `start`, `end`, `d1`, and `d2` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `s1` and `s2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum of `s1` and `s2`.

Output: **minimum of s1 and s2 (where s1 and s2 are calculated based on the values of start, end, lst, d1, and d2)**
