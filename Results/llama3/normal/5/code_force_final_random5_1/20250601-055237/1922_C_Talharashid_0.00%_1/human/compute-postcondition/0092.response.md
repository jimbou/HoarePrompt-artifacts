Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is at least 3, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is an integer equal to start - 1, end is an integer equal to end - 1, inc is -1, s is 0, m must be greater than 2, and stdin contains no input.**

The code block reads two integers from stdin, assigns them to start and end, and then decrements both start and end by 1. The variable s remains unchanged at 0. The rest of the variables and conditions from the initial state remain unaffected.
