Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is at least 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is equal to the second input minus 1, inc is -1, start is equal to the first input minus 1, d2 has a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of start and the value is s, s is 0, m must be greater than 0, and stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the indices end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the indices start and end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices. The minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed.**
