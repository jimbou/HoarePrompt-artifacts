Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `start` is equal to the second last index of `lst`, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is 11111111, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the variable `mini` has been assigned the value 11111111. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, and `s` are still valid.
