Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is greater than 0 and is equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
