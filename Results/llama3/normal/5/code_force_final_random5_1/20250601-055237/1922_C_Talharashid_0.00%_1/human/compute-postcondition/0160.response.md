Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is equal to 0, inc is equal to -1, m is an integer, start is not equal to 0, start is equal to start - 1, d2 has an additional key-value pair where the key is the new value of start and the value is s.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is -1, effectively decrementing `start` by 1. Then, it adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `d2`, where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
