Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is equal to the second last index of lst, end is equal to 0, inc is equal to -1, s is equal to 0, m is an integer, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and 11111111, if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini remains 11111111.**

The code block modifies the values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, and `s`. The value of `start` is set to the second last index of `lst`, `end` is set to 0, `inc` is set to -1, and `s` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
