Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is 0, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to the length of lst minus 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value, s is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, and `s`. The first line sets `start` to the last index of `lst`, which is `len(lst) - 1`. The second line sets `end` to 0. The third line sets `inc` to -1. The fourth line sets `s` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `m`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
