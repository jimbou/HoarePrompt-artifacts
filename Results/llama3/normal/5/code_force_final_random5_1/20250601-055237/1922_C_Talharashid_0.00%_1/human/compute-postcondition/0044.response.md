Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, stdin contains no input. If the second last index of `lst` plus 1 is less than the length of `lst`, then the current value of `start` is equal to the second last index of `lst` and the current value of `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start + 1` indices of `lst` and 11111111. Otherwise, the current value of `start` is equal to the last index of `lst` and the current value of `mini` is 11111111. Additionally, the current value of `start` is greater than 1.**
