Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 2`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `d2` has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers and the length of `lst` must be greater than 1, `end` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and its previous value, `start` is either 0 or greater than -1 if the length of `lst` is greater than 1, otherwise `start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1, and `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
