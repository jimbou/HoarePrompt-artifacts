Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is 0, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, s is 0, m is an integer, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer. start is the current start index plus 1, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst if start is greater than 0, s is 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst, otherwise s is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst and the previous value of s.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer, start is the current start index plus 1 and must be less than end, s is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and the previous value of s, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the previous value of mini.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m` + 1, `i` is equal to `m` + 1, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer, `start` is the current start index plus 1 and must be less than the last index of `lst` minus 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s` plus 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, the previous value of `s`, and the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111, if `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
