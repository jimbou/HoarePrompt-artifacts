Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `start+1` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least one element, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `mini` is 11111111, stdin contains no input, `start` must be less than `end`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` is set to 11111111, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input state remains empty, and the conditions on the variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, and `start` are still valid.
