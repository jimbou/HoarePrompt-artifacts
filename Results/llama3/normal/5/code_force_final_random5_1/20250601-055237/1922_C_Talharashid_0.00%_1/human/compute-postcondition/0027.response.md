According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is the updated index which is start+inc and must be less than or equal to end, and end is the last index of lst and must be greater than 0. start being less than or equal to end does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to start must be less than end. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is start+1 and the value is s+1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst, otherwise the value is s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), and the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst must have at least one element, end is the last index of lst and must be greater than 0, inc is 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the previous value of mini if start + 1 < len(lst), otherwise mini remains the same, stdin contains no input, start must be less than end**
