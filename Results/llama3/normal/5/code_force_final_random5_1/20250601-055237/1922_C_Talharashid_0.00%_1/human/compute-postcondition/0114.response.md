Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer. start is the current start index plus 1, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst if start is greater than 0, s is 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst, otherwise s is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst and the previous value of s.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been incremented by `inc`, which is 1. The dictionary `d1` now includes a new key-value pair where the key is the updated `start` index and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the updated `start` index. The value of `s` has been updated based on the comparison between `mini` and the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start + inc` indices of `lst`. If they are equal, `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current `start` and `start + inc` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`. The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst` if `start` is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
