stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case consists of four parts: the first part is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the second part is an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5), the third part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9), and the fourth part is a list of m queries (1 <= m <= 10^5), where each query is a pair of integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i).
