Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is greater than 0 and is equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `start` is decremented by 1, `d2` has a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, `start` must be greater than 0, and `mini` is 11111111.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, and `inc` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `start` is decremented by 1, and a new key-value pair is added to `d2` with the new value of `start` as the key and `s` as the value. Additionally, a new variable `mini` is introduced with a value of 11111111.
