Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `start+1` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least one element, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the previous value of `mini` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains the same, stdin contains no input, `start` must be less than `end`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and its previous value, but only if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`. If `start + 1` is not less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` remains the same.
