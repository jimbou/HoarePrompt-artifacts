Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer, start is the current start index plus 1 and must be less than end, s is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and the previous value of s, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the previous value of mini.**

The code increments the `start` index by 1 and adds a new key-value pair to the `d1` dictionary, where the key is the updated `start` index and the value is the current value of `s`. The value of `s` is updated based on the comparison between the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start + 1` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. If they are equal, `s` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is updated to be the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current `start` and `start + 1` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s`. The value of `mini` is also updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst` and the previous value of `mini`.
