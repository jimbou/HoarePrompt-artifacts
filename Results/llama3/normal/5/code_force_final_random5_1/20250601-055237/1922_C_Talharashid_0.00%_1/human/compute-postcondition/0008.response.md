Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least one element, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains no input. If `lst` has at least two elements, `start` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst`, and the current value of `start` is less than the second last index of `lst`. Otherwise, `start` is the last index of `lst`. The current value of `start` is greater than 1***
