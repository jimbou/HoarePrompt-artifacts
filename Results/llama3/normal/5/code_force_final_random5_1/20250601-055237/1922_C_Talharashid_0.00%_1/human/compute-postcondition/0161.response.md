To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `start` and `end`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `start != end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is not equal to 0, `start` is equal to `start - 1`, and `end` is equal to 0.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `start` so that it is not equal to `end`. Since `end` is equal to 0, we need to adjust `start` to be not equal to 0. The current state of `start` is not equal to 0, so we don't need to change it. However, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end` in the next iteration.

Since `start` is equal to `start - 1`, we can infer that `start` is decreasing by 1 in each iteration. To ensure that `start` is not equal to `end` in the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `start` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer, `start` is greater than 0, `start` is equal to `start - 1`, `d2` has an additional key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`.**
