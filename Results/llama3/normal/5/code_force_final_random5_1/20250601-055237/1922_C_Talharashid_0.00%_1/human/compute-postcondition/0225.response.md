The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is either 0 or greater than -1 and is equal to its previous value plus inc and must be less than end, and end is equal to the length of lst minus 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, start must be less than end, so start must be less than the length of lst minus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s or s + 1, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s or s + 1, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is equal to the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is either 0 or greater than -1 and is equal to its previous value plus inc and must be less than the length of lst minus 1. If start + 1 is less than the length of lst, then mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and 11111111, and s is either 1 or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and its previous value, or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and its previous value plus 1, or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of lst and its previous value plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and 11111111, and s is either 1 or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value, or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value plus 1, or equal to the sum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and its previous value plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
