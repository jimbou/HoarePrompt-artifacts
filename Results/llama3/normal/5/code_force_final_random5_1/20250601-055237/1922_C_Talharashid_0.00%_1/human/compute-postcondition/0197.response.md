Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is equal to the value of start from the input minus 1, end is equal to the value of end from the input minus 1, inc is equal to -1, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, s is 0, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the end index and the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the end and end - 1 indices of lst. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.**
