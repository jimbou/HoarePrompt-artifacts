Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least one element, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `stdin` contains no input. If `start` is greater than 1 and less than the second last index of `lst`, `start` is not updated and `mini` is not the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the current and previous elements of `lst`. Otherwise, no changes are made. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the current and next elements of `lst`***
