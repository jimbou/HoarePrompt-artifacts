Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is 0, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, s is 0, m is an integer, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `m`, and `stdin` remain unchanged from the initial state. The values of `start` and `end` are updated to 0 and the last index of `lst`, respectively. The value of `inc` is updated to 1, and the value of `s` is updated to 0.
