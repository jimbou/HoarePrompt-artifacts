Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `start` is equal to the second last index of `lst`, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `s` is equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `mini` is equal to 11111111.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables, such as `t` being greater than `m + 1` and `i` being equal to `m + 1`, are still valid.
