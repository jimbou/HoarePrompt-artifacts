Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least one element, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the `start` index, `start` is not updated and `mini` is not the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the current and previous elements of `lst` if `start` is greater than 1 and less than the second last index of `lst`, otherwise no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the `start` index. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `start` and `mini` are still valid, but no changes have been made to them.
