Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is 0, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to the length of lst minus 3, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is incremented by 1. Otherwise, s is incremented by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1]. d2[start] is s if start + 1 is less than the length of lst. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc` (which is -1), effectively decrementing `start` by 1. This changes the value of `start` from the length of `lst` minus 2 to the length of `lst` minus 3. The code then assigns the value of `s` to `d2[start]`. The value of `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1` is greater than -1.
