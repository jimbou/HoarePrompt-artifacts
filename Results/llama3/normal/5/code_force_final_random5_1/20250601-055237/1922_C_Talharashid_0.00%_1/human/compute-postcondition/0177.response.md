Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is equal to the value of end from the input minus 1, inc is equal to -1, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, start is equal to the value of start from the input minus 1, s is 0, d2 has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of start and the value is s, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the end index and the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the end and end - 1 indices of lst.**

The code calculates the absolute differences between the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the end index and the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, and assigns it to s1. It also calculates the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the end and end - 1 indices of lst, and assigns it to s2. The values of s1 and s2 are determined by the values of d1 and d2, which are dictionaries with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, and the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, respectively. The values of d1 and d2 are not modified by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state. The values of t, i, n, lst, end, inc, m, start, and s also remain the same as in the initial state.
