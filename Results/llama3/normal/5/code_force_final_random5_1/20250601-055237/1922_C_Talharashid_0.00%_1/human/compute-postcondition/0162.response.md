Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer, `start` is greater than 0, `start` is equal to `start - 1`, `d2` has an additional key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, `mini` is equal to 11111111.**

The code assigns the value 11111111 to the variable `mini`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
