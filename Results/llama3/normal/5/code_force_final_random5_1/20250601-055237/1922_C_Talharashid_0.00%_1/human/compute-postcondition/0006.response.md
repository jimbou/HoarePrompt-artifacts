Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `start` is 0, `end` is the last index of `lst` and must be greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst`, and `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `start` is less than the second last index of `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
