Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `s` is equal to the previous value of `s` plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`, `m` is an integer. If the second last index of `lst` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1, then the current value of `start` is equal to the second last index of `lst` and the current value of `mini` is equal to the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`. Otherwise, the current value of `start` is equal to the last index of `lst` and the current value of `mini` is equal to the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111. Additionally, if `start - 1 > -1`, then the current value of `start` is greater than 1. The value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
