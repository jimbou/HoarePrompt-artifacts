Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 2, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers and the length of lst must be greater than 1, end is an integer, inc is -1, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, start is an integer, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, s is 0, stdin contains no input**

The code block reads two integers from stdin, assigns them to start and end, and then decrements both by 1. It then initializes s to 0. The values of t, i, d1, d2, n, lst, inc, and m remain unchanged. The value of start is updated to the input value minus 1, and the value of s is reset to 0. The value of end is updated to the input value minus 1. The value of mini is not affected by the code block.
