Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer, `start` is equal to `start - 1`, `s` is equal to the previous value of `s` plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`, otherwise `s` is equal to 1.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is -1, effectively decrementing `start` by 1. Then, it assigns the value of `s` to the key `start` in dictionary `d2`. The value of `s` is either the previous value of `s` plus the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`, or 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of `lst`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
