Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m` + 1, `i` is equal to `m` + 1, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer, `start` is the current start index plus 1 and must be less than the last index of `lst` minus 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and the previous value of `s` plus 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, the previous value of `s`, and the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111, if `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111.**

The code increments the `start` index by `inc` (which is 1) and then assigns the value of `s` to the dictionary `d1` at the new `start` index. This means that the value of `s` is stored in `d1` at the index that is one more than the previous `start` index. The value of `s` is calculated based on the previous value of `s` and the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start + 1` indices of `lst`. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start + 1` indices of `lst`, then `s` is incremented by 1, otherwise it is not. The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` and `start - 1` indices of `lst` and 11111111, if `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise it remains 11111111.
