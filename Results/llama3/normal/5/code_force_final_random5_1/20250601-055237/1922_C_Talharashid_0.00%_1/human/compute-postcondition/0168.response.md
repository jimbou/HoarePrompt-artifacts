Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer, `start` is greater than 0, `start` is equal to `start - 1`, `d2` has an additional key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, `m`, and `start` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is increased by the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `lst`. The dictionary `d2` has an additional key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is the updated `s`. If the current index `start` is not at the end of the list, the value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute differences between the current element and the next element, and the minimum of the absolute differences between the current element and the previous element, and 11111111.
