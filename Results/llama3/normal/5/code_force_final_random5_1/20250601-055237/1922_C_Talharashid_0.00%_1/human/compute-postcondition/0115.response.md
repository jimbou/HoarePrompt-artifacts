The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is the current start index plus 1, and end is the last index of lst. For the loop to be executed one more time, start must be less than end. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer. start is the current start index plus 1 and must be less than end, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst if start is greater than 0, s is 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst, otherwise s is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start + inc indices of lst and the previous value of s.**
