The code prints the minimum of two values: s1 and s2. The values of s1 and s2 depend on whether the value of start is less than the value of end or not.

If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the end index and the sum of absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index. s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and the sum of absolute differences between the elements at the end and end - 1 indices of lst.

If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end indices.

Output: **the minimum of s1 and s2 (where s1 and s2 are the absolute differences between the sums of absolute differences of elements in lst, and their values depend on whether start is less than end or not)**
