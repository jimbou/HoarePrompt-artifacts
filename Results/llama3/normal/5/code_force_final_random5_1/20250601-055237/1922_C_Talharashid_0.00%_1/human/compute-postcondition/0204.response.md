Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 2`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `d2` has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers and the length of `lst` must be greater than 1, `start` is 0, `end` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111. The current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start + 1 indices of `lst` and 11111111. The other variables remain unchanged.
