The only variables in the loop head are variables `start` and `end`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is not equal to `end`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `start` is equal to the second last index of `lst` and `end` is equal to 0. Since `start` is the second last index of `lst`, it is not equal to 0. Therefore, the states of `start` and `end` do not need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than m + 1, i is equal to m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of lst starting from the start index, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of lst and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst, n is an integer, lst must have at least two elements, start is equal to the second last index of lst, end is equal to 0, inc is equal to -1, s is equal to 0, m is an integer, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of lst and 11111111, if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini remains 11111111**
