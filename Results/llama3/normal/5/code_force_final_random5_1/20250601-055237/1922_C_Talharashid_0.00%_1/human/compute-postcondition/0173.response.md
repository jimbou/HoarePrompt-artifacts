Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the current and next elements of `lst` starting from the start index, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the index of `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst`, `n` is an integer, `lst` must have at least two elements, `end` is equal to 0, `inc` is equal to -1, `m` is an integer, `start` is equal to `end`, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements at the current start and start - 1 indices of `lst` for all iterations, `d2` has additional key-value pairs where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s` for all iterations, `m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to be equal to the integer input from the user. The other variables remain unchanged. The loop has finished executing, and the final state is as described above.
