To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are:

* `_` (a throwaway variable)
* `range` (a built-in function)
* `int` (a built-in function)
* `input` (a built-in function)

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state.

The `range` function takes an integer argument, which is the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute again, the `input` function must return a value that, when converted to an integer, is greater than the current value of `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be incremented by 1.

The states of `l`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 5001, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty**
