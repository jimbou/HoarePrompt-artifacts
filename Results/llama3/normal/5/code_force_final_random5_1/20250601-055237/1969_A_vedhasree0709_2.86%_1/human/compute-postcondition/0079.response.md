Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers. It then checks for a specific condition in each test case: if there exists a pair of adjacent integers where the first integer is equal to its 1-based index plus 2 and the second integer is equal to its 1-based index plus 1, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
