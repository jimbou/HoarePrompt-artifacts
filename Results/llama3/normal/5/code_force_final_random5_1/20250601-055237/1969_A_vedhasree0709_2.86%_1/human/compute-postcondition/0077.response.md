Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1. If `j` is 0, then there does not exist an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, and the number 3 is printed. If `j` is 1, then there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, and the number 2 is printed. In both cases, stdin is empty.***
