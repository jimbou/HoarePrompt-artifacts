Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1 if there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, otherwise `j` is 0, stdin is empty. If there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, then the number 2 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The list `l` remains unchanged.
* The variable `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times.
* The variable `j` is 1 if there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`. Otherwise, `j` is 0.
* The stdin remains empty.
* If there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, then the number 2 is printed.
