Output State: **n is an integer, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is 0, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j`. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which was initially an integer between 2 and 5001. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`, which was initially a list of integers. The third line sets `i` to 0, which was initially equal to `n`. The fourth line sets `j` to 0, which was initially either 0 or 1. Stdin, which was initially empty, now contains two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
