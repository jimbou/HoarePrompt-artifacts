To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`, which should contain an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000). 

So, for the loop to execute, the state of `stdin` should be adjusted to contain an integer `t` that is at least 1 and at most 5000. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its state is not relevant.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000)**
