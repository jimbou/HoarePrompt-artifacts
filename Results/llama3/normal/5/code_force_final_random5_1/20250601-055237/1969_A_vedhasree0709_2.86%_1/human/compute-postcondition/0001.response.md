Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is 0, stdin is empty**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since the input is between 1 and 5000, `n` becomes an integer in this range. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`. Since the input is a list of integers, `l` becomes a list of integers. The third and fourth lines assign 0 to `i` and `j`, respectively. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, and `l` is a list of integers. The values of `i` and `j` are 0. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
