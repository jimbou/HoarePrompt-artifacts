Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty. If there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.***
