Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i <= n - 1:
        if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
            print(2)
            j = 1
            break
        i += 1
    if j == 0:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty. If there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0 or 1, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the loop executed at least once and the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was true at any point, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 was printed. Otherwise, `j` remains 0 and the number 3 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1. If `j` is 0, then there does not exist an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, and the number 3 is printed. If `j` is 1, then there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, and the number 2 is printed. In both cases, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
