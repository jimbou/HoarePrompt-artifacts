Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0 or 1, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `l[1]` is equal to 3 and the current value of `l[2]` is equal to 2, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `j` being 1 and the number 2 being printed is now based on the values of `l[1]` and `l[2]`, since `i` is now 1.
