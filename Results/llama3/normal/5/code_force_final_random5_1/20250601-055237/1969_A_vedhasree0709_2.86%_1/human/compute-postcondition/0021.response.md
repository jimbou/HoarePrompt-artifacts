Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1 if there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`, otherwise `j` is 0, stdin is empty, and the number 2 is printed if there exists an index `k` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
*   The list `l` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
*   The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes executing, as it is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it exceeds `n - 1`.
*   The variable `j` will be set to 1 if there exists an index `k` in the list `l` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`. If no such index exists, `j` will remain 0.
*   The stdin remains empty, as there are no operations that modify it within the loop.
*   The number 2 will be printed if there exists an index `k` in the list `l` such that `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1`.
