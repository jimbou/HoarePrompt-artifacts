Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, l is a list of integers, i is 1, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of l[1] is equal to 3 and the current value of l[2] is equal to 2, then j is 1 and the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, j remains 0.***
