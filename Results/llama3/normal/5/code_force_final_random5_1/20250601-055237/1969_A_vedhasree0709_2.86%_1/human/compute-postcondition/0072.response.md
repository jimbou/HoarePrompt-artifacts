Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `i` is 3, `j` is 1 if `l[1]` is equal to 3 and `l[2]` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, stdin is empty. If `l[2]` is equal to 4 and `l[3]` is equal to 3, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, nothing is printed.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin remains empty. The condition for printing the number 2 is still dependent on the values of `l[2]` and `l[3]`.
