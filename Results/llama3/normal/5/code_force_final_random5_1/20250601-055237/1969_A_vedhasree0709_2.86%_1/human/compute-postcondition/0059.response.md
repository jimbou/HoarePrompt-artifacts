Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of integers equal to the second input, i is 0, j is 0, stdin is empty. If the current value of l[i] is equal to i + 2 and the current value of l[i + 1] is equal to i + 1, then j is 1 and the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the values of n, l, i, j, and stdin remain unchanged.***
