Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `l[1]` is equal to 3 and `l[2]` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, stdin is empty. If `l[2]` is equal to 4 and `l[3]` is equal to 3, the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, nothing is printed.***
