Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `l[1]` is equal to 3 and the current value of `l[2]` is equal to 2, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 2, and `l` is still a list of integers. The stdin still contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The conditional statement regarding `j` and the printing of the number 2 remains the same, depending on the values of `l[1]` and `l[2]`.
