Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, stdin is empty. If the current value of `l[i]` is equal to `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the values of `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]` is still valid, but since `i` has changed, the values being compared are now `l[1]` and `l[2]`.
