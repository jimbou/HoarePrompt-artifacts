Output: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The loop did not execute or the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was not true at any point, or if it was true, the number 2 was not printed, and the number 3 is being printed**
