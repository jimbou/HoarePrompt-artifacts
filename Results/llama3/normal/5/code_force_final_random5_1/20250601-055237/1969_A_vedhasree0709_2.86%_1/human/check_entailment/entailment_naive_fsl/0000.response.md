Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
3 4 1 2

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2. The friends 1 and 2 can be invited, and both will come to the party since they are each other's best friends.

The program only checks for a specific pattern in the input list, but it does not consider all possible cases. It assumes that if the pattern is not found, the minimum number of invitations is 3, which is not always true.
