Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 0 or 1, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the loop executed at least once and the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was true at any point, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 was printed. Otherwise, `j` remains 0 and the number 3 is being printed.***
