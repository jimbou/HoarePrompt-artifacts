To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i <= n - 1`. This means we need to adjust the values of `i` and `n` if necessary.

1. **Current State**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, stdin is empty.

2. **Loop Condition**: `i <= n - 1`

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is 1, for the loop to certainly execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 or more. However, since `n` is already defined as being between 1 and 5000, and we are looking to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure `n` is at least 3 or more to satisfy the condition `i <= n - 1` for the next iteration.

4. **State Adjustment**: The only necessary adjustment is to ensure `n` is at least 3, as this guarantees that the loop condition will be met for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, stdin is empty.**
