Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party. The program checks for a specific condition in each test case: if there exists a pair of adjacent integers where the first integer is equal to its 1-based index plus 2 and the second integer is equal to its 1-based index plus 1, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement does not guarantee that the input will always contain such a pair of adjacent integers. In fact, the problem statement explicitly states that all p_i are distinct, which means that the condition checked by the program may not always be true.

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle cases where the input does not contain such a pair of adjacent integers. In such cases, the program simply prints 3, which may not be the correct answer. The correct approach would be to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party, regardless of the input.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
