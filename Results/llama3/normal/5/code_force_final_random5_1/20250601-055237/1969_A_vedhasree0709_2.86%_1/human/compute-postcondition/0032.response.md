Output State: **n is greater than 0, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is 1, stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of l[i] is equal to i + 2 and the current value of l[i + 1] is equal to i + 1, and the number 2 is being printed.**

The code assigns the value 1 to j, and then encounters a break statement. The break statement does not affect any variables, but it does exit the loop. Since the loop is exited, the remaining lines of code are not executed. The value of n remains greater than 0, the list l remains unchanged, and the value of i remains 0. The value of j is updated to 1. The stdin remains unchanged, containing 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of l[i] is still equal to i + 2, and the current value of l[i + 1] is still equal to i + 1. The number 2 is still being printed.
