Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `l[1]` is equal to 3 and `l[2]` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, stdin is empty, and the number 2 is printed if `l[1]` is equal to 3 and `l[2]` is equal to 2.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `j` is still dependent on the values of `l[1]` and `l[2]`, so its value is still conditional. The stdin is still empty, and the printing of the number 2 is still dependent on the values of `l[1]` and `l[2]`.
