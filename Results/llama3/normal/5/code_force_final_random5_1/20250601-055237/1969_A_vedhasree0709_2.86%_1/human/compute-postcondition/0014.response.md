Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `l[1]` is equal to 3 and `l[2]` is equal to 2, otherwise `j` is 0, stdin is empty, and the number 2 is being printed if `l[1]` is equal to 3 and `l[2]` is equal to 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `j` is still dependent on the values of `l[1]` and `l[2]`, and the printing of the number 2 is still conditional on the same values. The stdin remains empty.
