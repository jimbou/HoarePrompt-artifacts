Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, stdin is empty. If the current value of `l[i]` is equal to `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and stdin remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `j` and the printing of the number 2 still depends on the values of `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]`, but since `i` has changed, the values being compared are now `l[1]` and `l[2]`.
