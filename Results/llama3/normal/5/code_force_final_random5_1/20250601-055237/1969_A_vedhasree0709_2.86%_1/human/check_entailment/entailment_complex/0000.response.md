Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the program only checks for a specific condition where two adjacent friends are each other's best friends and prints 2 if this condition is met, or 3 otherwise.

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible scenarios. For example, if the input is [3, 1, 2, 5, 4], the program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2 because Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5, and both of them will come to the party.

A correct solution would involve finding the minimum number of invitations required to ensure that at least two friends come to the party, considering all possible pairs of friends and their best friends.

Correctness: **False**
