Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 49, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99, ans is True**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `m`. Since `m` was previously an integer between 2 and 50, it remains an integer between 2 and 50. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. Since `arr` was previously a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, it remains a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99. The third line assigns the value True to `ans`. Since `ans` was previously either True or False, it is now True. No other variables are affected.
