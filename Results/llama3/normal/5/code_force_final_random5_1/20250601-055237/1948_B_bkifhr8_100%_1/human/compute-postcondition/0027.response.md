Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 1, i is 1, ans is True if for all i from m-1 to 1, the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order, otherwise ans is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether the digits of consecutive elements in the list are sorted in ascending order or not.**

The first line of the code assigns the value of the input to `m`, which is an integer between 2 and 50. The second line assigns a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 to `arr`. The third line sets `ans` to `True`, indicating that the digits of consecutive elements in the list are sorted in ascending order. 

Note that the value of `n` is not affected by the code, so it remains an integer between 2 and 50. The value of `stdin` is also updated, as two lines of input are consumed by the code, leaving `t-3` test cases. The values of `_` and `i` are not affected by the code, so they remain 1. The value of `ans` is set to `True`, but it may be updated later in the code based on the sorting of the digits of consecutive elements in the list.
