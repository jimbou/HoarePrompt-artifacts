Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `_` is 1, `i` is `m-1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` are not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.***
