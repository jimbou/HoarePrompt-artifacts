Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The new variable `nums` is created, which is a list of integers. The first elements of `nums` are the digits of the integer `arr[m - 3]`, and the last element is the integer `arr[m - 2]`.
