The code prints a string indicating whether the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order for all `i` from `m-1` to `1`. The string will be 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Output: **YES if the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order for all i from m-1 to 1, otherwise NO**
