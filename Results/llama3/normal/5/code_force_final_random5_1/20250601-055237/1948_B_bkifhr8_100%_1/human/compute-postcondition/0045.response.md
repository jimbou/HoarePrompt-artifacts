Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 2`. If `nums` is not sorted, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
