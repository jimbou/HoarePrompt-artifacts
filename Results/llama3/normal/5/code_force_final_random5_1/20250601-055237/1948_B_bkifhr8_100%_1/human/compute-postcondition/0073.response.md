Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where all elements are sorted in ascending order, `ans` is True if all elements in `arr` are sorted in ascending order, otherwise `ans` is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` will be sorted in ascending order, and the variable `ans` will be True if the list is sorted, otherwise it will be False. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
