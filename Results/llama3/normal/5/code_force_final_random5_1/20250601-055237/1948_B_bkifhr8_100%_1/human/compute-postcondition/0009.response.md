Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0, i is m-1, and the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], nums is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False. Otherwise, ans remains True, and arr[i - 1] is now equal to the first digit of the original arr[i - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, m, arr, stdin, _, i, and the relationship between arr[i] and arr[i - 1] remain the same. The value of arr[i - 1] is updated to be the first digit of its original value. The value of nums and ans also remain the same, depending on whether nums is sorted in ascending order or not.
