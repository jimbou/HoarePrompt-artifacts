The only variable in the loop head is variable `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 2 and 50. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `ans` is either True or False**
