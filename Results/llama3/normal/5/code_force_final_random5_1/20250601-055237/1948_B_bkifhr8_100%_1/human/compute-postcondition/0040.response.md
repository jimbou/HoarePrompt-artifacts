Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where `arr[m-3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m-2`. If the list of digits of `arr[m-3]` followed by `arr[m-2]` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, for all `i` from `m-1` to 2, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is False and 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[m-3]` has been updated to `nums[0]`, which is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` being True or False still depends on the sorted order of the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` for all `i` from `m-1` to 2.
