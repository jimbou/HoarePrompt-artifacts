Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will output "YES", but it should output "NO" because it is not possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The correct output should be "NO" because after splitting the first element, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] which is not sorted.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the current element is less than the previous element, and if so, it splits the previous element and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, this approach is not sufficient to cover all possible cases. The program should also check if the current element is greater than the next element, and if so, it should split the current element and check if the resulting array is sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
