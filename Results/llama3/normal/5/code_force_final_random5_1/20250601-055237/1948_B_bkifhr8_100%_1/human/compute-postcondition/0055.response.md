Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still between 1 and 49, `m` is still greater than 1, `arr` is still a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `ans` is still True, `i` is still `m - 1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is still less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`. Additionally, a new variable `nums` is created, which is a list of integers. The first elements of `nums` are the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in `arr`, and the last element of `nums` is the integer at index `i` in `arr`.
