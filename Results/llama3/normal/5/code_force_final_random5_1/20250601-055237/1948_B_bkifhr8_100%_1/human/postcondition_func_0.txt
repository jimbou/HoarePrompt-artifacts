This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then checks if the integers can be sorted in ascending order by repeatedly replacing the largest two consecutive elements with their digits sorted in ascending order. If the integers can be sorted, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.
