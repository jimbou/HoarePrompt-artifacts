Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `_` is 1, `ans` is True if for all `i` from `m-1` to 1, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, otherwise `ans` is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether the digits of consecutive elements in the list are sorted in ascending order or not, `i` is `m-1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the code has created a new list `nums` that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, which are both integers between 0 and 99. The digits of `arr[i - 1]` are converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension, and then `arr[i]` is appended to this list.
