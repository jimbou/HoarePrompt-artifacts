Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99, nums is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], i is m - 2, ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is inside. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

The initial state of the variables `n`, `m`, `arr`, `nums`, and `i` remains unchanged as none of these variables are modified by the code snippet. The only change is the assignment of `False` to `ans`.
