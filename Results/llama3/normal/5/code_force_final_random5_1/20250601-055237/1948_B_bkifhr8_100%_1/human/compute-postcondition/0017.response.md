The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1. For the loop to execute again, i must be 2.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99. If the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], then the (i-1)th element of arr is the first digit of the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], and the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the value of arr remains unchanged, i is 2**
