Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0, i is m-1. If the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], then ans is False if the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, ans remains True, and arr[i - 1] is now equal to the first digit of the original arr[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99. If the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], then the (i-1)th element of arr is the first digit of the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], and the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the value of arr remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, i is 2. If the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], then the (i-1)th element of arr is the first digit of the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], and the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order, and nums is a list of digits of arr[1] followed by arr[2] with the first digit removed, and arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 with arr[1] being the first digit of the original nums. If the list of digits of arr[1] followed by arr[2] is not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False. Otherwise, no change is made to ans. If the current value of arr[i] is not less than the current value of arr[i - 1], then the value of arr remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
