Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0, i is m-2, nums is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i]. If nums is not sorted in ascending order, ans is False. Otherwise, no change is made to ans.***
