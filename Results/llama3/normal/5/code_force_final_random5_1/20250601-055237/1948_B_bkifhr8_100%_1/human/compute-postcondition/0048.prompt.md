Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 1, i is 1, ans is True if for all i from m-1 to 1, the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order, otherwise ans is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether the digits of consecutive elements in the list are sorted in ascending order or not.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99. If for all `i` from `m-1` to 1, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is False and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99. If the list of digits of `arr[m-3]` followed by `arr[m-2]` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, for all `i` from `m-1` to 2, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is False and 'NO' is printed. If `arr[m-2]` is less than `arr[m-3]`, then `arr[m-3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99. If the list of digits of `arr[m-3]` followed by `arr[m-2]` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, for all `i` from `m-1` to 2, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is False and 'NO' is printed. If `arr[m-2]` is less than `arr[m-3]`, then `arr[m-3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
