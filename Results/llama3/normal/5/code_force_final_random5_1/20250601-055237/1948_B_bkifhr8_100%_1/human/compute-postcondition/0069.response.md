Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 49, m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 where arr[m - 3] is replaced by nums[0], i is m - 3, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[m - 4] and the last element is arr[m - 3], ans is False**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed within. However, in this context, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
