Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99, i is m-2, nums is a list of digits of arr[m-3] followed by arr[m-2], ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the output state.

The initial state describes the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`, as well as the condition for `ans` to be `True` or `False`. However, the code snippet does not modify any of these variables except for `ans`, which is set to `False`. Therefore, the output state includes the same information as the initial state, with the only change being the value of `ans`, which is now `False`.
