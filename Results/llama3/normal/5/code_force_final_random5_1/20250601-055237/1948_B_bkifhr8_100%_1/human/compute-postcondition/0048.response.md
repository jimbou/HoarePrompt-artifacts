Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99. If for all i from m-1 to 1, the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order, then ans is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, ans is False and 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the program will have checked all pairs of consecutive elements in the list `arr` to see if the digits of the first element followed by the second element are in sorted order. If all pairs are in sorted order, the program will print 'YES' and set `ans` to True. If any pair is not in sorted order, the program will print 'NO' and set `ans` to False.
