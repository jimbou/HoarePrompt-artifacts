Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
