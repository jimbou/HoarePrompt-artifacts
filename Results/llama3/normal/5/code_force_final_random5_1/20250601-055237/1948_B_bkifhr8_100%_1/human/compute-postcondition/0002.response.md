Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0**

The code reads an integer `m` from the input and assigns it to the variable `m`. It then reads `m` integers from the input, splits them into a list, and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The variable `ans` is initialized to `True`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The input stream `stdin` now contains `t-2` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99). The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.
