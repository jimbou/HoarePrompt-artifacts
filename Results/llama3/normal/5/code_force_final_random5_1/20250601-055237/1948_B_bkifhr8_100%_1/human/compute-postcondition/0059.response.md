Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If the list `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of its original value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `nums` still contains the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the value of `arr[i]`. The value of `ans` is still dependent on whether the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not.
