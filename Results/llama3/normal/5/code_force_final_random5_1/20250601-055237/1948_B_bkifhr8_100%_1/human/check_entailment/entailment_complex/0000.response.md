Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements `arr`.
3. It initializes a variable `ans` to `True`, which will be used to track whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. The program then iterates over the array in reverse order (from `m-1` to `0`). For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If so, it attempts to "split" the previous element into its digits and inserts them in the correct order.
5. If the resulting array is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
6. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements:

* It checks if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the "split" operation.
* It handles cases where the array is already sorted or can be sorted by splitting elements.
* It correctly identifies cases where the array cannot be sorted, even after applying the "split" operation.

The execution states provided as comments also match the expected behavior of the program.

Therefore, I conclude that the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
