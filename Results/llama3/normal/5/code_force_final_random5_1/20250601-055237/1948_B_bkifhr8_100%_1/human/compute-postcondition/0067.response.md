The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`, which is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where `arr[m - 3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`. If `arr[m - 2]` is less than `arr[m - 3]`, then `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**
