Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`, `arr` is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, if the current value of `arr[2]` is less than the current value of `arr[1]`, then the list of digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]` is sorted in ascending order.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`. The value of `arr` remains unchanged if `arr[2]` is not less than `arr[1]`. If `arr[2]` is less than `arr[1]`, then the list of digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.
