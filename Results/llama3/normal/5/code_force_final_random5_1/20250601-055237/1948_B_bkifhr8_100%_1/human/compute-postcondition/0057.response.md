Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 49, m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99, ans is False, i is m - 1, the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], and nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i]. The list nums is not sorted in ascending order.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was initially `True`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or the current execution block. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `ans`, which is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
