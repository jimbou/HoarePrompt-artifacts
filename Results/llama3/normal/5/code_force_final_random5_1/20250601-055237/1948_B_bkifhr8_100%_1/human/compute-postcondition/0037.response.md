Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `i` is `m-2`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[m-3]` followed by `arr[m-2]`, if for all `i` from `m-1` to 2, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is False and 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The new variable `nums` is created, which is a list of digits of `arr[m-3]` followed by `arr[m-2]`. The value of `nums` is calculated by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and adding it to the list. Then, `arr[i]` is added to the list. The value of `ans` and the printed output remain the same as in the initial state, depending on whether the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order for all `i` from `m-1` to 2.
