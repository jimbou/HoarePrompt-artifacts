Based on the initial state, we know that `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, where all elements are sorted in ascending order. This means that the list is already sorted, and therefore, `ans` will be `True`.

The print statement uses a list indexing trick to print either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` will evaluate to `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
