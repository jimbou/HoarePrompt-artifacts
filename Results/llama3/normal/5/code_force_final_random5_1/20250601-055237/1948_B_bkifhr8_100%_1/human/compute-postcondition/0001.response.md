The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 2 and 50 and stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99). So for the loop to be executed  the n is greater than 0 and _ is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
