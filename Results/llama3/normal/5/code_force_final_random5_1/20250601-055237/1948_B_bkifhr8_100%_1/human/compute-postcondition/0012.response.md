Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0, i is m-2, nums is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i].**

In natural language, the output state is that the variables n, m, arr, stdin, _, and i retain their initial values. The new variable nums is created, which is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i]. This list is created by converting arr[i - 1] to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting it back to an integer, and adding it to the list, and then appending arr[i] to the list.
