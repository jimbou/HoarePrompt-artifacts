Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-descending order using the given operation.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.
3. It initializes a variable `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.
4. It then iterates over the array from the second last element to the first element (in reverse order).
5. For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, it means that the array is not sorted.
6. In this case, it tries to split the previous element into its digits and append the current element to it. It then checks if the resulting list is sorted. If it's not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks the loop.
7. If the loop completes without finding any unsorted elements, it means that the array can be sorted, and `ans` remains `True`.
8. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the array has only one element.

Correctness: **True**
