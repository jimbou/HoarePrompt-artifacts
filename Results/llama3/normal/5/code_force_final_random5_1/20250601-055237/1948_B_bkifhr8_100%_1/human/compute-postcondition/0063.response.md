Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 49, m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99, i is m - 2, ans is False, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[m - 3] and the last element is arr[m - 2].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was initially `True`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed within. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program's flow in this context.

Therefore, the only change in the output state compared to the initial state is the value of `ans`, which is now `False`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) retain their initial values and properties as described in the initial state.
