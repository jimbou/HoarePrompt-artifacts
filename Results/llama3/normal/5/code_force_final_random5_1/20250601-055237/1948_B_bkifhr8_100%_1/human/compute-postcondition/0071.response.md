Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where `arr[m - 3]` is replaced by `nums[0]` and `arr[m - 4]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 4]` and the last element is `arr[m - 3]`. If `arr[m - 3]` is less than `arr[m - 4]` and `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr` at index `m - 4` is updated to be the first element of `nums`, which is the same as the value of `arr` at index `m - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` being False is still dependent on the comparison between `arr[m - 3]` and `arr[m - 4]`, and the sorted order of `nums`.
