Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, where `i` is `m - 2`. This means that `nums` now contains the digits of the two consecutive elements in the `arr` list, starting from the second last element. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and the condition for `ans` remain the same as in the initial state.
