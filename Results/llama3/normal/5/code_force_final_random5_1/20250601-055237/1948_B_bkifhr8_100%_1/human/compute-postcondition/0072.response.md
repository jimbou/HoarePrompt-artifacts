Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where `arr[m - 3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`. If `arr[m - 2]` is less than `arr[m - 3]`, then `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. If `arr[m - 3]` is less than `arr[m - 4]`, then `arr[m - 4]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 4]` and the last element is `arr[m - 3]`, and `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
