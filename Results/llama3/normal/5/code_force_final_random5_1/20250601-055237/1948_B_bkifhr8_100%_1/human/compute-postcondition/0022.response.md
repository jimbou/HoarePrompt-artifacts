Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, i is 2. If the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], then the (i-1)th element of arr is the first digit of the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], and the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order, and nums is a list of digits of arr[1] followed by arr[2] with the first digit removed, and arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 with arr[1] being the first digit of the original nums. If the list of digits of arr[1] followed by arr[2] is not sorted in ascending order, then ans is False. Otherwise, no change is made to ans. If the current value of arr[i] is not less than the current value of arr[i - 1], then the value of arr remains unchanged.***
