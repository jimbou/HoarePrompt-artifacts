Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of `nums`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 2`. If `nums` is not sorted, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The function still has the possibility of returning False if `nums` is not sorted, or not returning any value if `nums` is sorted.
