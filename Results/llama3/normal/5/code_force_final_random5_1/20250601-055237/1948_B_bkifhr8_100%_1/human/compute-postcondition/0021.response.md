Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]` with the first digit removed, `arr` is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 with `arr[1]` being the first digit of the original `nums`, If the list of digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[1]` has been updated to be the first digit of the original `nums`, and the first digit has been removed from `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` is still dependent on whether the list of digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]` is sorted in ascending order.
