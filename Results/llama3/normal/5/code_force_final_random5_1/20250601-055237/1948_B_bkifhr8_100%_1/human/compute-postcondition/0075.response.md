The code prints 'YES' if all elements in `arr` are sorted in ascending order, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Since `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where all elements are sorted in ascending order, the value of `ans` is True.
Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where all elements are sorted in ascending order, `ans` is True if all elements in `arr` are sorted in ascending order, otherwise `ans` is False, and 'YES' is printed**
