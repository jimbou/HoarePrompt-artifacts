Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 49, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99, ans is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `i` is `m - 1`. If the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is equal to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If the list `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where `arr[m - 3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`. If `arr[m - 2]` is less than `arr[m - 3]`, then `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where `arr[m - 3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`. If `arr[m - 2]` is less than `arr[m - 3]`, then `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. If `arr[m - 3]` is less than `arr[m - 4]`, then `arr[m - 4]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 4]` and the last element is `arr[m - 3]`, and `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
