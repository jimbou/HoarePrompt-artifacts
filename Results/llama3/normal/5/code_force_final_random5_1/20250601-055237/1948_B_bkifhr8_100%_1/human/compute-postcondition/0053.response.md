To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 1, since the range starts from `m - 1` and goes down to 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `m` to be greater than 1, and `i` to be `m - 1` (the starting value of the range).

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`**
