Output State: **n is 1, m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 where all elements are sorted in ascending order, ans is True, and 'YES' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 1, and the value of `m` will be an integer greater than 1. The list `arr` will contain `m` integers between 0 and 99, and all elements in `arr` will be sorted in ascending order. The variable `ans` will be True, indicating that all elements in `arr` are sorted in ascending order. Finally, the string 'YES' will be printed, indicating that the loop has successfully sorted the elements in `arr`.
