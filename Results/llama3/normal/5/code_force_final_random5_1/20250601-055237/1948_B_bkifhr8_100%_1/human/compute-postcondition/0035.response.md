Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99. If for all `i` from `m-1` to 1, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is False and 'NO' is printed.***
