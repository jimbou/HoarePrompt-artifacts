Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, and whenever it finds a pair of elements that are not in non-decreasing order, it checks if the digits of the larger element can be rearranged to be in non-decreasing order with the smaller element. If this is not possible, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the array has only one element. It also correctly handles the case when the array has multiple elements that need to be rearranged.

Correctness: **True**
