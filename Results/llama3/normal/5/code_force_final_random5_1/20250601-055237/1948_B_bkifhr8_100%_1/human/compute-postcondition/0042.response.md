To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`

The objects in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0. Since `i` is currently `m - 1`, we need to decrement `i` by 1 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `m` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99. If the list of digits of `arr[m-3]` followed by `arr[m-2]` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, for all `i` from `m-1` to 2, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is False and 'NO' is printed. If `arr[m-2]` is less than `arr[m-3]`, then `arr[m-3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 2`.**
