Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, where the (i-1)th element is the first digit of the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], _ is 0, i is m-2, nums is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the (i-1)th element of the list arr has been updated to be the first digit of the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i]. The other variables remain unchanged.
