Output: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0, i is 1, ans is True if for all i from m-1 to 1, the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order, otherwise ans is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether the digits of consecutive elements in the list are sorted in ascending order or not.**
