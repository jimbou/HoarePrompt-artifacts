Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0, i is m-1. If the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], then ans is False if the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is not sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, ans remains True, and arr[i - 1] is now equal to the first digit of the original arr[i - 1].***
