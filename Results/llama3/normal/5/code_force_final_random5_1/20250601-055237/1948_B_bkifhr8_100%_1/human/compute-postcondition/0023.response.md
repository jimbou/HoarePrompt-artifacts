Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50, m is an integer between 2 and 50, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), _ is 0, i is 1, ans is True if for all i from m-1 to 1, the list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i] is sorted in ascending order, otherwise ans is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is 1, and the value of `ans` is True if for all iterations of the loop, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order. If this condition is not met for any iteration, `ans` is False. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
