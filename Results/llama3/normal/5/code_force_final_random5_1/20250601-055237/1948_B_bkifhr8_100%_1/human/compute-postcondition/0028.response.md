The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `_` is 1, `ans` is True if for all `i` from `m-1` to 1, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, otherwise `ans` is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether the digits of consecutive elements in the list are sorted in ascending order or not. So for the loop to be executed `m` must be at least 2 and `i` is `m-1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `_` is 1, `ans` is True if for all `i` from `m-1` to 1, the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order, otherwise `ans` is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether the digits of consecutive elements in the list are sorted in ascending order or not, `i` is `m-1**
