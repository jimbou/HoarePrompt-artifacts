Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 where `arr[m - 3]` is replaced by `nums[0]`, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[m - 3]` has been updated to `nums[0]`, which is the first digit of the original `arr[m - 3]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `ans` still holds, meaning that if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, `ans` is False, otherwise its value remains the same.
