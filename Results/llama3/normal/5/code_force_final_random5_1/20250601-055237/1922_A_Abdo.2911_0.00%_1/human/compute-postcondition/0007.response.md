Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `template` has been updated to include the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` is still valid, and the stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
