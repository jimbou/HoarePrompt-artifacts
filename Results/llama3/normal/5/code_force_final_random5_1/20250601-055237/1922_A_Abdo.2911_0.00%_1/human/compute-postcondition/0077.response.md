Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing the character at index 0 of string `a`, `match_a_b` is not defined, `match_c` is not defined, 'NO' is printed, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 2 and 1000, and it is still greater than 1. The value of `n` is still greater than 0. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. There are still `t-3` test cases in the standard input. The value of `i` is still 0. The `template` list now contains the first character of string `a`. The variables `match_a_b` and `match_c` are still undefined. The string 'NO' has been printed. The current character at index `i` of string `a` is still equal to the current character at index `i` of string `b`.
