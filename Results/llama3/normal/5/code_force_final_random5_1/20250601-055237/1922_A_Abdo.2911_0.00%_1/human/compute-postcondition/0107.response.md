The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`). If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` remains `True`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then 'NO' is printed, and `match_a_b` is `False` if the current value of `a[i]` is either equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_a_b` remains `True`. `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**
