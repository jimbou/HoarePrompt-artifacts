The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `t-1` and `t` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is equal to `t` and `t` is greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is equal to n, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If match_a_b is True and match_c is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either match_a_b is False or match_c is True, and 'NO' is printed.**
