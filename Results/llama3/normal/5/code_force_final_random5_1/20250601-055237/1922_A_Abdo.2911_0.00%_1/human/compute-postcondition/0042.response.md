Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is False. If the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` (ignoring case), then `match_a_b` is False and the character at index `i` of `template` is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the character at index `i` of `template` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False and the character at index `i` of `template` is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. `match_c` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `match_c` is now True. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `template` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `match_a_b` are still the same. The only change is that `match_c` is now set to True.
