Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 1, template is a list containing either the character at index i of string a if a[i] is equal to b[i], or the uppercase of the character at index i of string a if a[i] is not equal to b[i], for all i in range(n). If a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_a_b is False. Otherwise, match_a_b remains True, stdin contains t-3 test cases.***
