Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 1, template is a list containing characters from string a (or b) if a[i] is equal to b[i], otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string a. If template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b is False if a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]. If template[i] is uppercase, then match_a_b is False if a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(), otherwise match_a_b remains unchanged. stdin contains t-5 test cases.***
