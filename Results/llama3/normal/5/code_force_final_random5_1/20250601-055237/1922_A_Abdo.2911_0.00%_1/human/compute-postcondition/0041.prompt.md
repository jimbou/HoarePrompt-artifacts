Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`, and `match_a_b` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is less than n, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_a_b is False, otherwise match_a_b is True. If the character at index i of a or b is equal to the character at index i of template (ignoring case), then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is less than n, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_a_b is False. If the character at index i of a or b is equal to the character at index i of template (ignoring case), then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the character at index i of template is lowercase, then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is less than n, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_a_b is False. If the character at index i of a or b is equal to the character at index i of template (ignoring case), then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the character at index i of template is lowercase, then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If a[i] is equal to template[i] and b[i] is equal to template[i], then match_a_b remains unchanged. If a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_a_b is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
