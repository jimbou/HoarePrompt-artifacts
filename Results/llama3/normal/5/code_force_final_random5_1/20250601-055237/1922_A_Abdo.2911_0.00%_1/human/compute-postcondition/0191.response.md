Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is True, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character.***
