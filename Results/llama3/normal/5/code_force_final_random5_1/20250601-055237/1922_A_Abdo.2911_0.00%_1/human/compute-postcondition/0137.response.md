Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`), `match_a_b` is False, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_c` is False if the character at index `i` of `c` (case insensitive) is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` (case insensitive), otherwise `match_c` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all characters in the strings `a` and `b` and has compared them with the corresponding characters in string `c`. The variable `match_c` is True if all characters in `c` match the corresponding characters in `template` (case sensitive for lowercase characters and case insensitive for uppercase characters), and False otherwise. The loop has also updated the value of `i` to be equal to `n`, indicating that it has finished iterating over all characters. The other variables remain unchanged.
