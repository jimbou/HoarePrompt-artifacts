Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive) for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_c` is True, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, and the current value of `template[i]` is either a lowercase character or all characters in `template` are uppercase.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop. If any character in `c` does not match the corresponding character in `template` (case-insensitive), `match_c` is False. Otherwise, `match_c` remains True. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `template`, and stdin remain unchanged.
