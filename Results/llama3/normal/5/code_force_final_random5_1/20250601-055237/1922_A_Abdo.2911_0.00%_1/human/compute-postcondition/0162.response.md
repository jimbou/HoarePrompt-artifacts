Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is True, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `match_a_b` which is set to True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-5` test cases.
