Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It constructs the template by iterating over the characters of strings a and b. If the characters at the same position are the same, it adds the lowercase character to the template. If the characters are different, it adds the uppercase version of the character from string a to the template.
3. The program then checks if strings a and b match the template. It iterates over the template and checks if the characters at the same position in strings a and b match the template. If any mismatch is found, it sets `match_a_b` to False.
4. The program then checks if string c matches the template. It iterates over the template and checks if the characters at the same position in string c match the template. If any mismatch is found, it sets `match_c` to False.
5. Finally, the program checks if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False. If this condition is met, it prints "YES", indicating that there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
