Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is equal to n, template is a list containing either the character at index i of string a if a[i] is equal to b[i], or the uppercase of the character at index i of string a if a[i] is not equal to b[i], for all i in range(n), 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the `template` list contains the characters from string `a` with the following modifications: if the character at index `i` in string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in string `b`, then the character is added to the `template` list as is; otherwise, the uppercase of the character is added to the `template` list. This process is repeated for all indices `i` in the range of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
