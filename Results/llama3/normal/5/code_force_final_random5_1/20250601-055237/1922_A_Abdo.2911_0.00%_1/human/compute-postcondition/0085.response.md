The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 2, 'NO' is printed. template is a list containing either the character at index 1 of string a if a[i] is equal to b[i], or the uppercase of the first character of string a if a[i] is not equal to b[i].**
