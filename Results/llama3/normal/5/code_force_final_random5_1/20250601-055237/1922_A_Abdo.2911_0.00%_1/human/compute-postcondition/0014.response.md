Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 1000, and it is still greater than 0. The value of `n` is still greater than 2. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. There are still `t-1` test cases in the standard input. The value of `i` is still 2. The `template` list now contains the character at index 2 of string `a` if it is equal to the character at index 2 of string `b`, otherwise it contains the uppercase of the character at index 2 of string `a`.
