Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 1, 'NO' is printed, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string `a`**.

The code appends the uppercase of the first character of string `a` to the `template` list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases. The value of `i` remains 1. The 'NO' is still printed. The `template` list now contains the uppercase of the first character of string `a`.
