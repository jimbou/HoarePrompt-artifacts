Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first creates a template by iterating over the characters of strings a and b. If the characters at the same position in both strings are the same, it adds the character to the template in lowercase. If the characters are different, it adds the character from string a in uppercase to the template.
2. It then checks if strings a and b match the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in strings a and b are the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in strings a and b are not the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
3. It also checks if string c matches the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in string c is the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in string c is not the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
4. Finally, it prints "YES" if strings a and b match the template and string c does not, and "NO" otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when strings a and b have the same characters at the same position, when they have different characters, and when string c matches or does not match the template.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
