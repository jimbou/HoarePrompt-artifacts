The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive) for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_c` is True, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, and the current value of `template[i]` is either a lowercase character or all characters in `template` are uppercase. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive), then `match_c` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
