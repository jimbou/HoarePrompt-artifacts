Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string `a`, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases, and `a[0]` is not equal to `b[0]`**

In this output state, the value of `template` has been updated to include the uppercase of the first character of string `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases. The condition that `a[0]` is not equal to `b[0]` is still valid.
