Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string `a`, `match_a_b` is not defined, `match_c` is not defined, 'NO' is printed, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `template` has been updated to include the uppercase of the first character of string `a`, which is `a[0].upper()`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` are the same as in the initial state. The condition `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` is still true, and 'NO' is still printed.
