Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `template` has been updated to include the character at index `i` of string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `template` is now a list containing a single character, which is the character at index `i` of string `a`.
