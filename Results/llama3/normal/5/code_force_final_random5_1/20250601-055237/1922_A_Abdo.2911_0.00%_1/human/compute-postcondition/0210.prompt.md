Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive) for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_c` is True, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, and the current value of `template[i]` is either a lowercase character or all characters in `template` are uppercase.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive) for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_c` is True, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, and the current value of `template[i]` is either a lowercase character or all characters in `template` are uppercase. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive), then `match_c` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive) for any `i` in range(`n`), otherwise `match_c` is True, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, and the current value of `template[i]` is either a lowercase character or all characters in `template` are uppercase. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` remains unchanged. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive), then `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive), then no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
