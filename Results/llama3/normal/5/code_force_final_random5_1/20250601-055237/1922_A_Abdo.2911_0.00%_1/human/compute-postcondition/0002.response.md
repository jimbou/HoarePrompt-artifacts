Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000) and t must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, template is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

Explanation: The code reads four lines of input for each test case: an integer `n`, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `t` is not modified by the code, so it remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first input line, which is an integer. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the next three input lines, which are strings. The variable `template` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `_` is not modified by the code, so it remains 0. Since the code reads four lines of input for each test case, the number of test cases remaining in stdin is reduced by 1.
