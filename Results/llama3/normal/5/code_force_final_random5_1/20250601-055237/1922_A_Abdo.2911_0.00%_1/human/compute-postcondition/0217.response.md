Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.**
