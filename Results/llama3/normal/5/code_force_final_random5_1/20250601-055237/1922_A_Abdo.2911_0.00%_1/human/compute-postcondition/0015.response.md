The code `template.append(a[i].upper())` appends the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. The character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, because if they were equal, `template` would be a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`, not its uppercase. Therefore, the character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`. The value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index 2 of string `a`, and the character at index 2 of string `a` is not equal to the character at index 2 of string `b`.**
