Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`), `match_a_b` is False, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_c` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_c` is False if the character at index `i` of `c` (case insensitive) is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` (case insensitive), otherwise `match_c` remains unchanged.***
