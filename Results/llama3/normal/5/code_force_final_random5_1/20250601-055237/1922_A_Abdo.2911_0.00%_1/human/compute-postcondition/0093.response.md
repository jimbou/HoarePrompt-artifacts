Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`), 'NO' is printed, `match_a_b` is True, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. The current value of the character at index `i` of `template` is lowercase. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.**
