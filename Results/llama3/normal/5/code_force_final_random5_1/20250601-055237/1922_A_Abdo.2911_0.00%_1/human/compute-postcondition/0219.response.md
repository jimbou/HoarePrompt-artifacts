Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings a, b, and c. It compares the strings a and b character by character, creating a template string where matching characters are copied as is, and non-matching characters are converted to uppercase. It then checks if string c matches the template string, allowing uppercase characters in c to match either the uppercase or lowercase version in the template. If string c does not match the template, but strings a and b do, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates.**
