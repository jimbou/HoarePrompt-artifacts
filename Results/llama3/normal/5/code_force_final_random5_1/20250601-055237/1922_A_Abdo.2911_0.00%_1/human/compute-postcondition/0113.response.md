Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`), `match_a_b` is False, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**

The loop will execute until `i` is equal to `n`. After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `match_a_b` will be False because the loop will have checked all characters in the strings `a` and `b` and found at least one mismatch. The other variables remain unchanged.
