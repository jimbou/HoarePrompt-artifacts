Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is False. If the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` (ignoring case), then `match_a_b` is False and the character at index `i` of `template` is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the character at index `i` of `template` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False and the character at index `i` of `template` is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. `match_c` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is less than `n`, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is False and `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` remains unchanged if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is False. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. If `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False. Otherwise, `match_c` is True. The character at index `i` of `template` is uppercase if it was originally lowercase. The current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case) if `template[i]` is uppercase.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b and match_c remain unchanged if c[i] is equal to template[i], otherwise match_a_b is False and match_c is False. If template[i] is uppercase, then match_a_b remains unchanged if a[i] is equal to template[i] and b[i] is equal to template[i], otherwise match_a_b is False. If a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_a_b is False. If c[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_c is False. Otherwise, match_c is True. The character at index i of template is uppercase if it was originally lowercase. The current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of template[i] (ignoring case) if template[i] is uppercase. If c[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_c is False. If c[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_c is False. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b and match_c remain unchanged if c[i] is equal to template[i], otherwise match_a_b is False and match_c is False. If template[i] is uppercase, then match_a_b remains unchanged if a[i] is equal to template[i] and b[i] is equal to template[i], otherwise match_a_b is False. If a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_a_b is False. If c[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_c is False. Otherwise, match_c is True. The character at index i of template is uppercase if it was originally lowercase. The current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of template[i] (ignoring case) if template[i] is uppercase. If c[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_c is False. If c[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_c is False. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If c[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_c is False. Otherwise, match_c is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
