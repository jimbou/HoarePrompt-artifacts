Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is either 2 or 3, `template` is a list containing the character at index 0 of string `a` (or `b`) if `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string `a`, either the character at index 1 of string `a` or the uppercase of the character at index 1 of string `a`, and the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`, and stdin contains `t-6` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 1 and 999 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The value of `n` is still greater than 1. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still either 2 or 3. The `template` list has been updated to include the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-6`.
