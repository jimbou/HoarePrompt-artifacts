Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is equal to n, template is an empty list, match_a_b is not defined, match_c is not defined, 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, 'NO' is printed. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then template is a list containing the character at index 0 of string a. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then template is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 1, 'NO' is printed. template is a list containing either the character at index 1 of string a if a[i] is equal to b[i], or the uppercase of the first character of string a if a[i] is not equal to b[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-6 test cases, i is 2, 'NO' is printed, template is a list containing either the character at index 1 of string a if a[i] is equal to b[i], or the uppercase of the first character of string a if a[i] is not equal to b[i], and either the character at index 2 of string a if a[i] is equal to b[i], or the uppercase of the character at index 2 of string a if a[i] is not equal to b[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
