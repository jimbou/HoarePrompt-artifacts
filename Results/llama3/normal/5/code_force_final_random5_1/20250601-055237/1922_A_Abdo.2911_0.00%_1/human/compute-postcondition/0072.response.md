Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is equal to n, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If match_a_b is True and match_c is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either match_a_b is False or match_c is True, and 'NO' is printed.***
