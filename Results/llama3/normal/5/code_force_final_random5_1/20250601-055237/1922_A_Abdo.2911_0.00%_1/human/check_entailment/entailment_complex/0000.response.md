Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It creates a template string by comparing characters of strings a and b. If the characters match, it copies the character as is; otherwise, it converts the character to uppercase.
3. It checks if strings a and b match the template string. If they don't, it sets `match_a_b` to False.
4. It checks if string c matches the template string. If it does, it sets `match_c` to False.
5. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, indicating that there exists a template t that matches strings a and b but not string c. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
