Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is equal to n, template is an empty list, match_a_b is not defined, match_c is not defined, 'NO' is printed**

Explanation:
The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since t is greater than 1, and t-2 test cases are left in stdin, this line will read the next test case. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to a. The third line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to b. The fourth line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to c. The fifth line initializes an empty list and assigns it to template. The variables match_a_b and match_c are not defined in the given code snippet, so their values remain undefined. Since the conditions for printing 'YES' are not met, 'NO' is printed.
