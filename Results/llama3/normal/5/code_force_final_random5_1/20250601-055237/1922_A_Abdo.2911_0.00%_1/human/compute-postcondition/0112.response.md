Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`). If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` remains `True` if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is `False`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_a_b` remains `True`. `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**
