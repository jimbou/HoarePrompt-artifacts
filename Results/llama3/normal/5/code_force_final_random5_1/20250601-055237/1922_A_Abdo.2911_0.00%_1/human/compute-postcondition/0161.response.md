Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same characteristics as the initial state, except for the variables `i` and `template`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `template` list will contain characters from string `a` (or `b`) if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are equal, otherwise it will contain the uppercase of the characters from string `a`. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and stdin, will remain unchanged.
