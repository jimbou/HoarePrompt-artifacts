Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
            ].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is equal to n, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If match_a_b is True and match_c is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either match_a_b is False or match_c is True, and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`). If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, then 'NO' is printed. stdin contains `t-3` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
