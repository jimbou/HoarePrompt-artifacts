Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`.***
