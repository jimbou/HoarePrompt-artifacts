Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is True, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase and the current value of `a[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_a_b` remains True. `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 1, template is a list containing characters from string a (or b) if a[i] is equal to b[i], otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string a. If template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b is False if a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]. If template[i] is uppercase, then match_a_b is False if a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(), otherwise match_a_b remains unchanged. stdin contains t-5 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 2, template is a list containing characters from string a (or b) if a[i] is equal to b[i], otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string a. If template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b is False if a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]. If template[i] is uppercase, then match_a_b is False if a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(), otherwise match_a_b remains unchanged. stdin contains t-5 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
