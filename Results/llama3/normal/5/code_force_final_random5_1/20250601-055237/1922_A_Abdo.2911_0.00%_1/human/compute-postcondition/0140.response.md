Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`), `match_a_b` is True, and `match_c` is False. The current value of `match_a_b` is True and the current value of `match_c` is False. stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and 'YES' is printed**
