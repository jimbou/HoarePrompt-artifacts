Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 1, 'NO' is printed, `template` is a list containing either the character at index 1 of string `a` or the uppercase of the first character of string `a` depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `template` has been updated based on the condition `a[i] == b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains the character at index 1 of string `a`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains the uppercase of the first character of string `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
