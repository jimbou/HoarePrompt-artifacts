Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is True, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. The current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.***
