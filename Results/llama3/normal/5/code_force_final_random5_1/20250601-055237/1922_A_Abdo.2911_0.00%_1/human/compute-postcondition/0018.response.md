Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`, and `match_a_b` is True.**

In this output state, the value of `match_a_b` has been set to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `template` is still dependent on the comparison of characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, but now `match_a_b` is explicitly set to True.
