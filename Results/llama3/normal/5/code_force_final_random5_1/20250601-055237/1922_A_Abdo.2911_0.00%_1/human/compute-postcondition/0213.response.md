Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing characters from string `a` (or `b`) if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the characters from string `a`, `match_a_b` is True because `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `match_c` is False because `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (case-insensitive) for some `i` in range(`n`), stdin contains `t-5` test cases, and the current value of `template[i]` is either a lowercase character or all characters in `template` are uppercase, and 'YES' is printed**
