Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`), 'NO' is printed, `match_a_b` is True, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`), if `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is True. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then 'NO' is printed, and `match_a_b` is False if the current value of `a[i]` is either equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_a_b` remains True. stdin contains `t-3` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 1, template is a list containing either the character at index i of string a if a[i] is equal to b[i], or the uppercase of the character at index i of string a if a[i] is not equal to b[i], for all i in range(n). If template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b is False if a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i], otherwise match_a_b remains True. If template[i] is uppercase, then 'NO' is printed, and match_a_b is False if the current value of a[i] is either equal to template[i] (ignoring case) or b[i] is equal to template[i] (ignoring case), otherwise match_a_b remains True. stdin contains t-3 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`). If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` remains `True` if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` and `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is `False`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_a_b` remains `True`. `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
