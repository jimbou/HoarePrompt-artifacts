Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing the character at index 0 of string `a` (or `b`), stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 1 and 999, and it's greater than 0. The value of `n` is still greater than 0. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still 0. The list `template` now contains the first character of string `a` (which is equal to the first character of string `b`). The number of test cases in stdin is still `t-5`.
