Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is either 2 or 3, `template` is a list containing the character at index 0 of string `a` (or `b`) if `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the first character of string `a` and either the character at index 1 of string `a` or the uppercase of the character at index 1 of string `a`, and the character at index `i` of string `a`, and stdin contains `t-6` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `template` has been updated to include the character at index `i` of string `a`. The value of `i` is either 2 or 3, so the character appended to `template` is either the character at index 2 or 3 of string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
