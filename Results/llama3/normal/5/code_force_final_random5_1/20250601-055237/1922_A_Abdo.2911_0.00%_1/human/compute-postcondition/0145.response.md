To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `t`. Since `_` is not explicitly defined, we can assume it is an iteration counter that starts from 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1.

Since `t` is greater than 1, we can decrement `t` by 1 to reflect the remaining number of iterations.

The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `template`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`, and `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`). If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, then 'NO' is printed. stdin contains `t-4` test cases.**
