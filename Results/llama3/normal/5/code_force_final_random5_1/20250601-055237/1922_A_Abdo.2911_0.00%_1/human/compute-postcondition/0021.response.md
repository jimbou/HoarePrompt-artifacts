Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is less than `n`, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`, and `match_a_b` is True. The current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.***
