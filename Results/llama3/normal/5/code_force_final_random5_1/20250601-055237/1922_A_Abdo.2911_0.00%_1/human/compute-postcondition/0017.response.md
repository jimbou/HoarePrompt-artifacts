Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n`. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the `template` list will contain the characters from string `a` that are equal to the corresponding characters in string `b`, and the uppercase of the characters from string `a` that are not equal to the corresponding characters in string `b`. The other variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
