Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 1, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` if the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise `template` is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the `template` list now contains the character at index `i` of string `a` if it is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, otherwise it contains the uppercase of that character. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
