Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is less than n, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_a_b is False. If the character at index i of a or b is equal to the character at index i of template (ignoring case), then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the character at index i of template is lowercase, then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If a[i] is equal to template[i] and b[i] is equal to template[i], then match_a_b remains unchanged. If a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_a_b is False.***
