Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-6 test cases, i is 2, 'NO' is printed, template is a list containing either the character at index 1 of string a if a[i] is equal to b[i], or the uppercase of the first character of string a if a[i] is not equal to b[i], and the uppercase of the character at index 2 of string a.**

In this output state, the value of `template` has been updated by appending the uppercase of the character at index 2 of string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-6` test cases instead of `t-5` because one test case has been processed.
