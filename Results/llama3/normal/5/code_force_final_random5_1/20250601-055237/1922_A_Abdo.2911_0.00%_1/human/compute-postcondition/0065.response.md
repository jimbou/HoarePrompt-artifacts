Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is equal to n, template is a list containing the character at index i of string a if the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, otherwise template is a list containing the uppercase of the character at index i of string a. If a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_a_b is False. If the character at index i of a or b is equal to the character at index i of template (ignoring case), then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the character at index i of template is lowercase, then match_a_b is False and the character at index i of template is uppercase. Otherwise, no changes are made. If a[i] is equal to template[i] and b[i] is equal to template[i], then match_a_b remains unchanged. If a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower(), then match_a_b is False. match_c is False.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The loop counter `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `template` list has been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body, and the `match_a_b` and `match_c` variables have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
