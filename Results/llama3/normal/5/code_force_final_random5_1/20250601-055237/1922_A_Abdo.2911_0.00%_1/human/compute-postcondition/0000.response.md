The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
