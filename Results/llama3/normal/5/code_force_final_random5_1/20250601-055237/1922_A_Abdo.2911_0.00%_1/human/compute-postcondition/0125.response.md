The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `template` is a list containing either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, or the uppercase of the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, for all `i` in range(`n`), `match_a_b` is False, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` remains True. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_c` is True if the character at index `i` of `c` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` (case insensitive), otherwise `match_c` is False.**
