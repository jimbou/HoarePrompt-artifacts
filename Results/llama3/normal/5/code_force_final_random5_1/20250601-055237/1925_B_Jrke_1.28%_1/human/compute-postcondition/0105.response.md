Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 4` to `int(x / 2)`, `l` is a list containing either two or three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and/or `x // i` whichever is larger, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `i`, `ans`, or `x // i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the list `l` now contains an additional element which is the result of `x // i`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`, which can be either `i`, `ans`, or `x // i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
