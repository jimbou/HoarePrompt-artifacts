Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial variables retain their values, and a new list `l` is created containing the value of `ans`, which is 1.
