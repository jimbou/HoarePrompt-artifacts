Postcondition: ***`x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` are integers, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive), and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing two elements: the value of `ans` and the value of `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`.***
