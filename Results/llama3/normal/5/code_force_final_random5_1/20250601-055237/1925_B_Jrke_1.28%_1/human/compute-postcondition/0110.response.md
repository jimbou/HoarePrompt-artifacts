Based on the initial state, we can analyze the code as follows:

1. `x` is an integer greater than 1.
2. `n` is an integer.
3. `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, which means `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.
4. `i` is equal to `int(x / n)`, which is equivalent to `k` since `k` is already an integer.
5. `ans` is a list containing the elements `k` and `i`.

Now, let's analyze the `print` statement:

`print(ans)`

Since `ans` is a list containing `k` and `i`, the `print` statement will output the list `ans` with its elements.

Output: **[k, i] (where k is the integer division of x by n, and i is equal to k)**

Note that since `k` and `i` are equal, the output will be a list with two identical elements.
