Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is either 1, an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), or the integer division of `x` by an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `i` is an odd integer between 4 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and the value of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is an odd integer between 4 and the square root of `x` (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
