Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, if `k` is equal to 1, the rest of the code inside the most internal loop is skipped.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is either 1, an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), or the integer division of `x` by an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `i` is an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and the integer division of `x` by `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value of `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise, `i` is an odd integer between 4 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or a list containing the value of `ans` and the value of `x` divided by `i` otherwise, if `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value of `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise, `i` is an odd integer between 6 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, and `ans` is the maximum value in list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` and `l` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
