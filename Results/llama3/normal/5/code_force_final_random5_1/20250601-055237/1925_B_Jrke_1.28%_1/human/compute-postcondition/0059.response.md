Postcondition: ***`x`, `n`, `k` are unchanged, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k`.***
