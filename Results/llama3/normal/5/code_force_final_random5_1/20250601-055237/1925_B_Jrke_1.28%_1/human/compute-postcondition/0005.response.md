The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, it skips the rest of the code inside the loop that the `continue` statement is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change but we skip the rest of the code inside the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n and is equal to 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), _ is 0, and the number 1 is being printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the most internal loop.
