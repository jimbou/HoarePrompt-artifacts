Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) to int(x / 2). If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, if `x` is divisible by `i` and `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `ans` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, no changes are made. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.***
