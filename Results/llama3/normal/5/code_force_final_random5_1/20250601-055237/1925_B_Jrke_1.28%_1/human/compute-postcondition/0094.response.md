Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 2 to int(x / 2), `l` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`**.

The list `l` has been reset to contain only one element, which is the value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still the maximum value in the list `l`, but since `l` now only contains one element, `ans` is equal to that single element.
