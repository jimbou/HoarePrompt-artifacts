Postcondition: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n. If k is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the most internal loop is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the remaining code inside the loop.**
