Output State: **`x`, `n`, `k` are unchanged, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i`.**

In natural language, the output state means that the values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain the same, while `i` is still an odd integer within the specified range, but its value has been increased by 2. The list `l` now contains two elements: the original value of `ans` and the new value of `i`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `i`.
