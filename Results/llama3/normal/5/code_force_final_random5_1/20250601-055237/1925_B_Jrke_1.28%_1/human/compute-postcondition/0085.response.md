Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) to int(x / 2). The current value of `i` is a divisor of `x` and is less than or equal to `k`. `l` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`.***
