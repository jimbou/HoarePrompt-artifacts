Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), _ is 0**

The code reads an integer t from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^3. Then, for each of the t lines, it reads two integers x and n from stdin, where x is between 1 and 10^8, and n is between 1 and x. The code then calculates the integer division of x by n and assigns it to k. The value of k is an integer because the division is integer division (//). The value of _ remains unchanged at 0. After the code executes, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x and n.
