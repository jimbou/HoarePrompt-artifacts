Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 4` to `int(x / 2)`, `l` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `ans` and `i`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `i`, `ans`, or `x // i` whichever is larger.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the value of `i`, and the value of `ans` remains the same as it was the maximum value in the list `l` before the update. The other variables remain unchanged.
