Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) to int(x / 2). The current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `ans` and `x // i`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, and their properties and relationships as specified in the initial state still hold. The list `l` also remains unchanged, but its elements are now compared to determine the maximum value, which is assigned to `ans`.
