To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):`.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. According to the code, `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is within the range from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 2` to `int(x / 2)`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 2.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 4` to `int(x / 2)`, `l` is a list containing either two elements which are the value of `ans` and `i` or one element which is the value of `ans` and `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `i`, `ans`, or `x // i` whichever is larger.**
