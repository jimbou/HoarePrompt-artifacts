Postcondition: ***`x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` are integers, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive). If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing either two or three elements: the value of `ans`, the value of `i`, and optionally the value of `x` divided by `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
