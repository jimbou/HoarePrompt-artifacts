Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value of `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise, `i` is an odd integer between 6 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the value of `i`, in addition to the value of `ans` that it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged.
