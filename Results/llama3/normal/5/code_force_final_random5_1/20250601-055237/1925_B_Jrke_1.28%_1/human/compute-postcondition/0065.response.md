Output State: **`x`, `n`, `k` are unchanged, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 4, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` which is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x // i` if `x // i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive), and it has been increased by 4. The list `l` now contains only the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value in the list `l`. The value of `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x // i` if `x // i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`.
