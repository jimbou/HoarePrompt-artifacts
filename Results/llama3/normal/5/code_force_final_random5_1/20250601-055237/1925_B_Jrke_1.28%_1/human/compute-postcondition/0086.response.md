Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) to int(x / 2). The current value of `i` is a divisor of `x` and is less than or equal to `k`. `l` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `ans` and `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is a divisor of `x` and is less than or equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
