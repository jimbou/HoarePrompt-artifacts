Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is either 1, an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), or the integer division of `x` by an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `i` is an odd integer between 4 and the square root of `x` (inclusive). If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and the value of `x` divided by `i`.***
