Output: **`x`, `n`, `k` are unchanged, `i` is the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x // i` if `x // i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, and the maximum value in the list `l` is being printed**
