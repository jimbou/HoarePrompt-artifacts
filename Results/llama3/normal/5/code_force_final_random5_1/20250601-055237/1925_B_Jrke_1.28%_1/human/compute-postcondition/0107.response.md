Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 4` to `int(x / 2)`, `l` is a list containing either one, two or three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and/or `x // i` whichever is larger, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `i`, `ans`, or `x // i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` contains either one or two elements which are the value of `ans` and/or `i`. `ans` is now equal to the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`, which is either `i`, `ans`, or `x // i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains either one, two, or three elements, depending on the value of `x // i` relative to `k`.
