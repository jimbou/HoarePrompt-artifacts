Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, if `k` is equal to 1, the rest of the code inside the most internal loop is skipped.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 1. The values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. The condition that if `k` is equal to 1, the rest of the code inside the most internal loop is skipped, is still valid.
