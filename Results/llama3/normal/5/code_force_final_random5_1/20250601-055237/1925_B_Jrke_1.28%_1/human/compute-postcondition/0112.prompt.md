Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    k = x // n
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            l = [ans]
            if i <= k:
                l.append(i)
            if x // i <= k:
                l.append(x // i)
            ans = max(l)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value of `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` and `l` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged, and the maximum value in list `l` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x`, `n`, `k` are unchanged, `i` is the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x // i` if `x // i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, and the maximum value in the list `l` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is equal to `int(x / n)`, and `ans` is equal to `x` minus `i` times `n`, and this is printed: `ans` which is equal to `x` minus `i` times `n`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
