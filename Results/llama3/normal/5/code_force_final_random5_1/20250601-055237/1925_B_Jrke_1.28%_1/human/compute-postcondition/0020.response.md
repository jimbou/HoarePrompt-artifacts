Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is either 1, an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), or the integer division of `x` by an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `i` is an odd integer between 4 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the list `l` now contains only the value of `ans`, which is either 1, an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), or the integer division of `x` by an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive).
