The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Since `i` is increased by 2, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 4.
State: **`x`, `n`, `k` are unchanged, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 4, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x // i` if `x // i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`.**
