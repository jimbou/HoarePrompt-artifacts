To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is greater than 1 and `i` is within the range specified by the loop.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive)**
