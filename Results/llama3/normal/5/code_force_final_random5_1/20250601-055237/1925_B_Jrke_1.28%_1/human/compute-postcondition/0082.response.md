To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is greater than 1 and `i` is within the specified range.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) to int(x ** 0.5) + 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i <= k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, `ans` is 1, and the maximum value in the list `l` is being printed, stdin is empty. If `k` equals 1, the number 1 is being printed.**
