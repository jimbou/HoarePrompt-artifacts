Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i <= k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, `ans` is 1, and the maximum value in the list `l` is being printed, stdin is empty. If `k` equals 1, the number 1 is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) to int(x / 2). If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, if `x` is divisible by `i` and `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `ans` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, no changes are made. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 2 to int(x / 2). If `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing either two elements which are the value of `ans` and `i` or one element which is the value of `ans` and `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `i`, `ans`, or `x // i` whichever is larger. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 4` to `int(x / 2)`, `l` is a list containing either one, two or three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and/or `x // i` whichever is larger, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `i`, `ans`, or `x // i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` contains three elements which are the value of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` contains either one or two elements which are the value of `ans` and/or `i`. `ans` is now equal to the maximum value in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
