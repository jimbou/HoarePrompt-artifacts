The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), and it must still be less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

State: **`x`, `n`, `k`, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 2, `l` is a list containing either two or three elements: the value of `ans`, the value of `i`, and optionally the value of `x` divided by `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**
