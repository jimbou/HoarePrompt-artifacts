The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, or the previous `ans` if `i` is greater than `k` or `x` is not divisible by `i`. 

Since the exact values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `ans` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated maximum value.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum of the previous ans and i if i <= k and x is divisible by i, or the previous ans if i > k or x is not divisible by i)**
