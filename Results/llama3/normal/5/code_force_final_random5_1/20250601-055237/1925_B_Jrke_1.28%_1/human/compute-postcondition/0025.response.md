Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value of `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise, `i` is an odd integer between 4 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or a list containing the value of `ans` and the value of `x` divided by `i` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value among `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise. The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `l` contains the updated values of `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the updated values of `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise.
