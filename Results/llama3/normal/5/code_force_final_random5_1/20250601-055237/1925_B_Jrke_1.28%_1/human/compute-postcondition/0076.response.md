Output State: **x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer equal to x // n, i is the square root of x (inclusive), l is a list containing the value of ans and i if i <= k and x is divisible by i. Otherwise, l is a list containing only the value of ans, ans is the maximum value in the list l which is the maximum of the previous ans and i if i <= k and x // i if x // i <= k and x is divisible by i, and the maximum value in the list l is being printed, stdin is empty**
