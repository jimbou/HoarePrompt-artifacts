Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value of `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise, `i` is an odd integer between 6 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, and `ans` is the maximum value in list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `ans` is now the maximum value in list `l`. The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` remain the same, and `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in list `l`.
