Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 2 to int(x / 2). If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `ans` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `i` or the previous value of `ans` whichever is larger. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.***
