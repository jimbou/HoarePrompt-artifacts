Output State: **x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer equal to x // n, i is the square root of x (inclusive), l is a list containing the value of ans and i if i <= k and x is divisible by i. Otherwise, l is a list containing only the value of ans, ans is the maximum value in the list l which is the maximum of the previous ans and i if i <= k and x // i if x // i <= k and x is divisible by i, and the maximum value in the list l is being printed, stdin is empty, and the number 1 is being printed.**

The continue statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the continue statement has no effect on the program state. The values of all variables remain the same, and the program continues to print the maximum value in the list l and the number 1.
