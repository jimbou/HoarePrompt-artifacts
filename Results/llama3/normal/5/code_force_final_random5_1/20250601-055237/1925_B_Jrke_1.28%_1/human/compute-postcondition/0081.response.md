Output State: **`x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is the square root of `x` (inclusive), `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i <= k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, `ans` is 1, and the maximum value in the list `l` is being printed, stdin is empty. If `k` equals 1, the number 1 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains the value of `ans` and `i` if `i <= k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, or only the value of `ans` otherwise. The maximum value in the list `l` is being printed, and if `k` equals 1, the number 1 is being printed.
