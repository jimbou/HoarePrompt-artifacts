Output State: **`x`, `n`, `k`, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 2, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In this output state, the list `l` has been updated to contain only the value of `ans`, which is also the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` retain their original values and properties.
