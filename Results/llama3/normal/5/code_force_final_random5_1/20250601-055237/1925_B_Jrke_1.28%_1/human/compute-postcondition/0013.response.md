Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is an odd integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive). Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1.***
