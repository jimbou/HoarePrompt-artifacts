Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` are integers. If `k` is 1, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive), and `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` and `l` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged, and the maximum value in list `l` is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` are integers, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive). If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing either two or three elements: the value of `ans`, the value of `i`, and optionally the value of `x` divided by `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x`, `n`, `k` are unchanged, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x // i` if `x // i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x`, `n`, `k` are unchanged, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive) and `i` is increased by 4. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` if `i` <= `k` and `x // i` if `x // i` <= `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
