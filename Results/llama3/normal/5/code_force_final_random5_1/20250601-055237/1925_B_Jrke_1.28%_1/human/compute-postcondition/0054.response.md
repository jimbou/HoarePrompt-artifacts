Output State: **`x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` are integers, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive), and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing three elements: the value of `ans`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing two elements: the value of `ans` and the value of `x` divided by `i`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive), and it is still a divisor of `x`. The list `l` still contains either two or three elements depending on the value of `i` and `k`. The variable `ans` is now assigned the maximum value in the list `l`.
