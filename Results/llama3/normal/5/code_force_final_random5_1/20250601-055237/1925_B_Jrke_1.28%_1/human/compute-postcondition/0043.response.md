Postcondition: **`x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `l` are integers. If `k` is 1, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans`, `i`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value of `ans` and `x` divided by `i` otherwise, `i` is an odd integer between 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0) and the square root of `x` (inclusive), and `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` and `l` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged, and the maximum value in list `l` is printed.**
