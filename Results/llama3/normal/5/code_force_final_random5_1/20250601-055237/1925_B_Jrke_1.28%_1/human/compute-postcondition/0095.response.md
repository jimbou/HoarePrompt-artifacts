Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to `x // n`, `i` is within the range from 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) + 2 to int(x / 2), `l` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `ans` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `i` or the previous value of `ans` whichever is larger.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the value of `i` as its second element. The value of `ans` has also been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`, which is either the previous value of `ans` or the value of `i`, whichever is larger. The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
