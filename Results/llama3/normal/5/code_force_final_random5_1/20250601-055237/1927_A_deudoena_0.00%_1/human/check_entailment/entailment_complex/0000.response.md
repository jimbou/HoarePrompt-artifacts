Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The program reads a string from standard input, finds the first and last occurrences of the character 'B' in the string, and prints the number of characters between these two occurrences.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the segment. It first finds the index of the first 'B' from the start of the string (ind1) and then finds the index of the first 'B' from the end of the string (ind2). The minimum length of the segment is then calculated as the difference between the length of the string and the sum of ind1 and ind2.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program reads the first line of the test case (which contains the length of the strip) and tries to find the first and last occurrences of 'B' in this line. But the actual string containing 'W' and 'B' is in the second line of the test case. The program does not read this line and therefore does not process the actual input.

Correctness: **False**
