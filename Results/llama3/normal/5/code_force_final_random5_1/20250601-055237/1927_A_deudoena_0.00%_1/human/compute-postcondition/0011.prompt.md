Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: inpstr is the first line of the first test case, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases
Code of the loop:
for i, j in enumerate(inpstr):
    if j == 'B':
        ind1 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *inpstr is the first line of the first test case and must have at least 1 character, i is 0, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, and the first character in inpstr is either 'B' or not 'B'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *inpstr is the first line of the first test case and must have at least 2 characters, i is 1, stdin contains the remaining test cases, and the second character in inpstr is either 'B' or not 'B'. If the second character in inpstr is 'B', then ind1 is 1 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, ind1 and ind2 remain unchanged. outind is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *inpstr is the first line of the first test case and must have at least 3 characters, i is 2, stdin contains the remaining test cases, and outind is 0. If the third character in inpstr is 'B', then ind1 is 2 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, ind1 and ind2 remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
