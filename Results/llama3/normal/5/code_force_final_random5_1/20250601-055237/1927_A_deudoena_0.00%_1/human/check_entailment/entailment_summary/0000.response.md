Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly finds the first and last occurrences of the character 'B' in the input string and prints the length of the segment that needs to be painted white, which is the difference between the indices of the last and first 'B' plus one. This is because the segment to be painted white must include all the black cells, and the length of this segment is the difference between the indices of the last and first 'B' plus one.

Correctness: **True**
