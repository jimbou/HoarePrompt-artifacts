Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: inpstr is the first line of the first test case, i is the length of inpstr minus 1, ind1 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, and stdin contains the remaining test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(inpstr)):
    if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
        ind2 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *inpstr is a string with at least 1 character, i is 0, ind1 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, and stdin contains the remaining test cases. If the last character of inpstr is 'B', then the function executes the if part. Otherwise, the function does nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *inpstr is a string with at least 1 character, i is 1, ind1 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr, and stdin contains the remaining test cases. If the last character of inpstr is 'B', then ind2 is 1 and outind is 0. Otherwise, ind2 is 0 and outind is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *inpstr is a string with at least 2 characters, i is 2, ind1 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr, and stdin contains the remaining test cases. If the second last character of inpstr is 'B', then ind2 is 2 and outind is 0. Otherwise, ind2 is 0 and outind is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
