To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop head is `for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i`, `j`, and `inpstr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `inpstr` is the first line of the first test case and must have at least 1 character, and the first character in `inpstr` is either 'B' or not 'B'.

For the loop to execute again, `inpstr` must have at least 2 characters, and `i` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can assume it will take the value of the next character in `inpstr`.

State: **`inpstr` is the first line of the first test case and must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, and the second character in `inpstr` is either 'B' or not 'B'**
