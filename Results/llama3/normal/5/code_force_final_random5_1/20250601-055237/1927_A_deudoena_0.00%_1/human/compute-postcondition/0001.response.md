To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `j`, and `inpstr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `inpstr`. If `inpstr` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute.

State: **`inpstr` is the first line of the first test case and must have at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `j` is the first character in `inpstr`, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases**
