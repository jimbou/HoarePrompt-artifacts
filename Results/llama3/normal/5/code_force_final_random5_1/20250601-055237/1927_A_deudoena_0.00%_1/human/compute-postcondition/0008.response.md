The only objects in the loop head are variables  i, j and string  inpstr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the inpstr.  If the string has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, inpstr has at least 2 characters, i is 1, j is the second character in the string. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 3 characters and the i is 2 and j is the third character in the string.
State: **inpstr is the first line of the first test case and must have at least 3 characters, i is 2, stdin contains the remaining test cases, and the third character in inpstr is either 'B' or not 'B'. If the third character in inpstr is 'B', then ind1 is 1 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, ind1 and ind2 remain unchanged. outind is 0.**
