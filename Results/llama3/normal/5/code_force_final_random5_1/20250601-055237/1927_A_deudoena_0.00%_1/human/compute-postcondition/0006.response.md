The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ind1`. Since `i` is 1, `ind1` becomes 1. The second line is a break statement, but since it is not inside a loop, it does not affect the program state.

Output State: **inpstr is the first line of the first test case and must have at least 2 characters, i is 1, ind1 is 1, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, and the second character in inpstr is either 'B' or not 'B'.**
