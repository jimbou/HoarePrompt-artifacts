Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the first integer in the list, and the current value of num is greater than the current value of cur. If the current value of num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is set to 0 and M is an empty dictionary. Otherwise, the values of cur and M remain unchanged.***
