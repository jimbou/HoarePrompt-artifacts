Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 1, cur is equal to the first integer in the list if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise cur is -1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the first integer in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs, and _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the second integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, M has two key-value pairs where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 1, and another key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list and the value is 1, and cur is equal to the second integer in the list. If num is not greater than cur, M has one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 2 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 2, and cur is equal to the first integer in the list if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise cur is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs, and _ is 1. If the third integer in the list is greater than cur, then cur is set to num, and M[cur] is set to 1. If the third integer in the list is greater than cur + 1, then cur is increased by 1 and stdin contains T-4 test cases. Otherwise, the value of the key 'cur' in M is increased by 1. In all cases, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the third integer in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
