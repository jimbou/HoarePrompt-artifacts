The code `cur = cnt[1]` assigns the second element of the list `cnt` to the variable `cur`. Since `cnt` contains all keys in the original dictionary `M` that have a count of 1, and it has at least 2 elements, `cur` is now equal to the second key in `M` that has a count of 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the second key in the original dictionary M that has a count of 1, M is a dictionary, cnt is a list containing all keys in the original dictionary M that have a count of 1, k is the last key in the original dictionary M.
