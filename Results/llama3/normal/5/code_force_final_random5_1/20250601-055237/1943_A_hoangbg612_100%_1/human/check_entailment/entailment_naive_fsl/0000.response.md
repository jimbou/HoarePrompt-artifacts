Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first sorts the input array `N` in ascending order. This is necessary to ensure that the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` is calculated correctly.

2. The program then iterates through the sorted array `N` and maintains a count of the number of occurrences of each number in the array `M`. If a number is greater than the current MEX `cur`, it increments `cur` and breaks the loop if `cur` is greater than the current number plus one. This is because the MEX of the array `c` cannot be greater than the maximum number in the array `N`.

3. After iterating through the array `N`, the program checks if the sum of the counts of all numbers in the array `M` is equal to the size of the array `S`. If it is, it increments `cur` by one. This is because if all numbers in the array `N` are used to calculate the MEX of the array `c`, the MEX will be one more than the maximum number in the array `N`.

4. The program then creates a list `cnt` of numbers in the array `M` that have a count of one. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to two, it sets `cur` to the second number in `cnt`. This is because if there are at least two numbers with a count of one, the MEX of the array `c` will be the second number in `cnt`.

5. Finally, the program prints the MEX `cur` of the array `c`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where the input array `N` contains duplicate numbers, and the case where the MEX of the array `c` is greater than the maximum number in the array `N`. Therefore, the program is correct.
