Postcondition: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs, and _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the second integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, M has two key-value pairs where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 1, and another key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list and the value is 1, and cur is equal to the second integer in the list. If num is not greater than cur, M has one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 2 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 2, and cur is equal to the first integer in the list if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise cur is -1.**
