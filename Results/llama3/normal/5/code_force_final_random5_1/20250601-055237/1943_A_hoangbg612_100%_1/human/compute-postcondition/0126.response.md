Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one integer, `_` is 2, `M` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `num` is the last integer in the original list `N`, and `k` is the third key in `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in `M` followed by `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` is a list containing the third key in `M` followed by `k`. Additionally, `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus one if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`.***
