Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, _ is 2, stdin contains T-5 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is an empty list, k is the last key in M, and the value of cur is being printed
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, and _ is 2. If the first integer in the list N is greater than -1, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list N and the value is 1, num is the first integer in the list N, k is the first integer in the list N, and cur is the first integer in the list N. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value greater than 0, num is less than or equal to -1, k is -1, and cur is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list N and the value is either 1 or 2 depending on whether num is greater than cur or not, num is the second integer in the list N, k is the second integer in the list N, and cur is the second integer in the list N.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the second integer in the list N and the value is either 1 or 2 depending on whether num is greater than cur or not, and the key is the third integer in the list N and the value is 1, num is the third integer in the list N, k is the second integer in the list N, cur is the third integer in the list N if num is greater than cur. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list N and the value is either 2 or 3 depending on whether num is greater than cur or not, num is the third integer in the list N, k is the second integer in the list N, and cur is the second integer in the list N.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
