The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the num is the second integer in the list.
State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the second integer in the list.**
