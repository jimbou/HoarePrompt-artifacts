Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains T-2 test cases, num is the second integer in the list, cur is equal to num, M[cur] is 1**

The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, and then sets `M[cur]` to 1. Since `num` is the second integer in the list, `cur` becomes equal to this value. The value of `M[cur]` is then set to 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state's conditions on `T`, `S`, `N`, and `stdin` remain valid, as they are not modified by the code.
