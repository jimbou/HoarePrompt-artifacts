Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 1 integer, cur is 0, M is an empty dictionary, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the first integer in the list, the current value of num is greater than the current value of cur, and the current value of num is greater than cur + 1.**

The code increments the value of `cur` by 1, making it 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
