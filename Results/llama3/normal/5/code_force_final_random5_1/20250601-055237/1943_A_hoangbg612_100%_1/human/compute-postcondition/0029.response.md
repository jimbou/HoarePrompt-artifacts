According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `M`. If `M` has at least 1 key, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `N` is a list, `stdin` contains `T-1` test cases, `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list `N` and the values are the counts of each integer in the list, `cnt` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the dictionary `M` must have at least 1 key and k is the first key in the dictionary `M`.
State: **`T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `N` is a list, `stdin` contains `T-1` test cases, `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list `N` and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 1 key, `cnt` is an empty list, k is the first key in the dictionary `M`**
