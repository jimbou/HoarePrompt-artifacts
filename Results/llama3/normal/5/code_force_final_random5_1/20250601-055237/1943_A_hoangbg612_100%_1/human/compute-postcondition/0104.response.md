Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains `T-5` test cases, `cnt` is an empty list, `_` is 2, `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list `N` and the value is 2, `num` is the second integer in the list `N`, `k` is the second integer in the list `N`, and `cur` is the second integer in the list `N`.**

The value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, where `cur` is the second integer in the list `N`. Since `M` initially had a key-value pair with the key being the second integer in the list `N` and the value being 1, the new value of `M[cur]` is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
