Output State: **T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list N and the value is 1, num is the second integer in the list N, k is the second integer in the list N, and cur is the second integer in the list N plus 1**

The code increments the value of `cur` by 1, but does not affect any other variables. The `break` statement does not have any impact on the variables as it is used to exit a loop, but there is no loop in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the final state includes all the initial variables with their original values, except for `cur`, which is incremented by 1.
