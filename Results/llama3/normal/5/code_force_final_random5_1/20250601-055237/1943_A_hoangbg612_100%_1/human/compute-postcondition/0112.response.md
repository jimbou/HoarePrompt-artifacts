Output State: **T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is an integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, num is the last integer in the original list N, k is the last key in M, and cur is the last integer in the original list N.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list N is empty, and the dictionary M contains key-value pairs where each key is an integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer. The variable num is the last integer in the original list N, k is the last key in M, and cur is the last integer in the original list N. The other variables remain unchanged.
