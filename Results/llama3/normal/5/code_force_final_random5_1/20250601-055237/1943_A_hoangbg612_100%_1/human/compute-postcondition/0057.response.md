Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 1, cur is equal to the first integer in the list if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise cur is -1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the second integer in the list, cur is equal to the first integer in the list plus 1 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise cur is 0.**

Explanation: The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since `cur` is initially equal to the first integer in the list if it is greater than the current value of `cur`, otherwise it is -1, the new value of `cur` will be the first integer in the list plus 1 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of `cur`, otherwise it will be 0. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
