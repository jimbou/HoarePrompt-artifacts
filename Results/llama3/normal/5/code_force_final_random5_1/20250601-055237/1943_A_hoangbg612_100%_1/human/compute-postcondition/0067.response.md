Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs, and _ is 1. If the third integer in the list is greater than cur, then cur is set to num, and M[cur] is set to 1. If the third integer in the list is greater than cur + 1, then cur is increased by 1 and stdin contains T-4 test cases. Otherwise, the value of the key 'cur' in M is increased by 1. In all cases, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the third integer in the list.***
