The only objects in the loop head are variables  num and list  N, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N.  If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary, stdin contains T-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 1 integer, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the first integer in the list**
