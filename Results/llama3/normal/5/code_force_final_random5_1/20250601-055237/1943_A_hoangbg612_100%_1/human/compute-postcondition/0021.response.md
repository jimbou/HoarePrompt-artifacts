Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains T-2 test cases, num is the third integer in the list, cur is equal to num, M[cur] is 1.**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of S also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list N remains a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 with at least 3 integers, but its contents are not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, from T-1 to T-2. The value of num remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of cur is updated to be equal to num. The dictionary M now has a new entry with key cur and value 1.
