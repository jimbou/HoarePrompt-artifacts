Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the first integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, cur is updated to num and M is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is cur (which is equal to num) and the value is 1. If num is less than or equal to cur, cur remains -1 and M is a dictionary with M[-1] = 1.***
