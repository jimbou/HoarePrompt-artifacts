To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `num` and the list `N`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If the list has at least one more integer, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` has at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `N` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the third integer in the list.**
