Output State: **T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is an empty dictionary, cur is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains T-5 test cases, num is the first integer in the list N, cnt is an empty list, k is the last key in M. The current value of num is greater than the current value of cur and also the current value of num is greater than cur + 1.**

The code block increments the value of `cur` by 1, making it 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `num` is still greater than `cur` and `cur + 1`.
