Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `N` is a list, `stdin` contains `T-1` test cases, `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list `N` and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 1 key, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in the dictionary `M`, `k` is the first key in the dictionary `M` and the current value of `M[k]` is 1**

In this output state, the code has appended the first key `k` from the dictionary `M` to the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
