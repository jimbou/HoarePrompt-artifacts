Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `S` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cur` is an integer and equals to `cur+1` if the sum of all values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise remains unchanged, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `T-3` test cases, `num` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k` from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` is 1, `k` is a key in `M` and the current value of `M[k]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `cur`, `_`, `stdin`, `num` remains unchanged. The list `cnt` now contains the key `k` from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` is 1.
