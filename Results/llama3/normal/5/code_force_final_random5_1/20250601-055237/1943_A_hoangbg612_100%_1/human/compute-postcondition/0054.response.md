Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 1, cur is -1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the first integer in the list, and num is less than or equal to cur**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1, so M[cur] is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
