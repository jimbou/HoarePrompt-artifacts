To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `k` and the dictionary `M`. The loop will execute if `M` has at least one key-value pair. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `M` to have at least one key-value pair.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `S` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cur` is an integer and equals to `cur+1` if the sum of all values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise remains unchanged, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `T-3` test cases, `num` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is an empty list, `k` is a key in `M`**
