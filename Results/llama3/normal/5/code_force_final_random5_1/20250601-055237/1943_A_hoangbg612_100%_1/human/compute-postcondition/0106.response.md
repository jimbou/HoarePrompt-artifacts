According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list N. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the num is the third integer in the list.
State: **T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list N and the value is either 1 or 2 depending on whether num is greater than cur or not, num is the third integer in the list N, k is the second integer in the list N, and cur is the second integer in the list N.**
