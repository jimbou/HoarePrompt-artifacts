Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 1, and another key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list and the value is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the second integer in the list, and cur is equal to the second integer in the list.**

The code modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The first line assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Since `num` is the second integer in the list, `cur` becomes the second integer in the list.
*   The second line adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `M` where the key is the current value of `cur` and the value is 1. Since `cur` is now the second integer in the list, this key-value pair is added to the dictionary.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `T` is still greater than 1, `S` is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `N` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `_` is still 1, and `stdin` still contains T-3 test cases.
