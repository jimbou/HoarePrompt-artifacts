Output State: **T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list N and the value is either 1 or 2 depending on whether num is greater than cur or not, num is the third integer in the list N, k is the second integer in the list N, and cur is the second integer in the list N plus 1.**

The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since `cur` was initially the second integer in the list `N`, its new value is the second integer in `N` plus 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
