Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 2 keys, and the first key has been iterated over. If the count of the second key in the dictionary M is 1, then cnt is a list containing the second key in the dictionary M and the key k that was just appended. If the count of the second key in the dictionary M is not 1, then cnt is an empty list and now contains the key k that was just appended.***
