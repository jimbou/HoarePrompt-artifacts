Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs, cur is an integer and equals to cur+1 if the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise remains unchanged, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1, k is the last key in M.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all key-value pairs in dictionary M. The list cnt now contains all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
