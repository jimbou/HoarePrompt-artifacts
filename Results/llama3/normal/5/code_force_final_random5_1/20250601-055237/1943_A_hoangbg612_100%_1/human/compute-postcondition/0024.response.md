Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list N will be empty because the loop iterates over all elements in N. The variable cur will be the last integer in the original list N because the loop updates cur to the current integer in each iteration. The dictionary M will contain the counts of each integer in the original list N because the loop increments the count of each integer in M in each iteration. The other variables, T and stdin, remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
