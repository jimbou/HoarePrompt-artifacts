The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N. If the list N has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list N must have at least 3 integers and num is the third integer in the list.
State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs, and _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the third integer in the list**
