To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `T` since it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `T` is at least 1.

State: **`T` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n)**
