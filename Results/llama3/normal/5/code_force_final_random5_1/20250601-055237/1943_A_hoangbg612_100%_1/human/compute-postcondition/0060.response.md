Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 2 if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 2, cur is equal to the first integer in the list if the first integer in the list is greater than the current value of cur, otherwise cur is -1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the second integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary M still has one key-value pair, but the value has been updated to 2. The value of cur remains the same, either the first integer in the list or -1, depending on the initial condition. The other variables, T, S, N, _, stdin, and num, are unaffected by the code and retain their initial values.
