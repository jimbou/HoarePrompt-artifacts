According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. Before the loop starts, T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases. For the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the first integer in the list**
