Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, and _ is 2. If the first integer in the list N is greater than -1, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list N and the value is 1, num is the first integer in the list N, k is the first integer in the list N, and cur is the first integer in the list N. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value greater than 0, num is less than or equal to -1, k is -1, and cur is -1.***
