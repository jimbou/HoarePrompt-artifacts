The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and T, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T. If T is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is at least 1. For the loop to execute again T must be greater than 1 and _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1.
State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-2 test cases, if there are at least two keys in the original dictionary M that have a count of 1, then cur is the second key in the original dictionary M that has a count of 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of cur is being printed, _ is 1**
