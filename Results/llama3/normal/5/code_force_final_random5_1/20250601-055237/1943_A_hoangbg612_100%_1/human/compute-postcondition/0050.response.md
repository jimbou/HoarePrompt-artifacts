Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is an empty dictionary, cur is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, the current value of num is the first integer in the list and is greater than the current value of cur, and the current value of num is more than 1 greater than the current value of cur.**

Explanation: The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1, making it 0. The second line is a `break` statement, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it does not have any effect. No other variables are affected by the code.
