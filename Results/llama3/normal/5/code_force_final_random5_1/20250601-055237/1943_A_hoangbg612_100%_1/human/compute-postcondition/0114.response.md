Output State: **T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is an integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, num is the last integer in the original list N, k is the last key in M, and cur is the last integer in the original list N plus one, and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 2, S is still an integer, N is still an empty list, stdin still contains T-5 test cases, cnt is still an empty list, _ is still 2, M is still a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is an integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, num is still the last integer in the original list N, k is still the last key in M, and cur is now the last integer in the original list N plus one. The sum of the values in dictionary M still equals S.
