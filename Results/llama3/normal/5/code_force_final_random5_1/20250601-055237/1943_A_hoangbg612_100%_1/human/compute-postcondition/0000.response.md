The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable T. The input contains multiple test cases, and the first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. 

Since T is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, T is now equal to the number of test cases, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). The input now contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).

Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).**
