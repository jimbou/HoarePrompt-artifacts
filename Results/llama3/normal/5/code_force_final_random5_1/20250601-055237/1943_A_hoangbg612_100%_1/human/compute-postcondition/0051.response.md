Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is an empty dictionary, stdin contains T-3 test cases, the current value of num is the first integer in the list and is greater than the current value of cur. If the current value of num is more than 1 greater than the current value of cur, then cur is set to 0. Otherwise, the value of cur remains unchanged.***
