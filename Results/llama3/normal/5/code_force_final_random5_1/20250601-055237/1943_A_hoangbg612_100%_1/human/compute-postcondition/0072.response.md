Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs, cur is an integer and equals to cur+1 if the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise remains unchanged, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the new variable `cnt` with an empty list value, and all the other variables from the initial state with their original values.
