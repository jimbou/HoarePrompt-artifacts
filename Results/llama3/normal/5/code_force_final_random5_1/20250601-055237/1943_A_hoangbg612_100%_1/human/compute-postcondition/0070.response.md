Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs, cur is an integer and equals to cur+1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the last integer in the list. The sum of all values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of cur has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The sum of all values in dictionary M is still equal to S. The number of test cases in stdin remains T-3.
