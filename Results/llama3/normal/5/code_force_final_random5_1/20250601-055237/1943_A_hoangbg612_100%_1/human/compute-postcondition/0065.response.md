Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs, _ is 1, cur is num, and M[cur] is 1. If the third integer in the list is greater than cur + 1, then cur is increased by 1 and stdin contains T-4 test cases. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The second line assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`. The value of `num` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `cur` after the first line executes. However, we can say that `cur` is now equal to `num`.

The second line assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`. Since `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[num]` is now equal to 1. The initial state specifies that `M` is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs, so after the second line executes, `M` may have one or two key-value pairs, depending on whether `num` was already a key in `M`.

The initial state also specifies that if the third integer in the list is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is increased by 1 and `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases. However, this condition is not affected by the code snippet, so we cannot determine whether this condition is true or false. Therefore, we include this condition in the output state, along with the updated values of `cur` and `M[cur]`.

In summary, the output state includes the updated values of `cur` and `M[cur]`, as well as the unchanged values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `_`. The condition regarding the third integer in the list and `cur` is also included, as it is not affected by the code snippet.
