Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` constructed by Alice.

The program first reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself. It then sorts the array `a` in ascending order.

The program then initializes a variable `cur` to -1 and an empty dictionary `M`. It iterates over the sorted array `a` and for each number `num`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur`. If it is, and `num` is not equal to `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`. If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it simply increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in the dictionary `M` is equal to the size of the array `n`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.

The program then creates a list `cnt` containing all keys in the dictionary `M` with a count of 1. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to the second element of `cnt`.

Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which represents the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
