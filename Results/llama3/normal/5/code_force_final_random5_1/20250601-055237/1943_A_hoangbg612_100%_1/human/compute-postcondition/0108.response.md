Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list N and the value is either 1 or 2 depending on whether num is greater than cur or not, num is the third integer in the list N, k is the second integer in the list N. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
