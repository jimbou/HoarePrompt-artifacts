Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the second integer in the list, M[cur] is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of M at the current index (cur) is incremented by 1. The values of T, S, N, stdin, and num remain unchanged.
