The code prints the value of `cur`, which is the second element in the list `cnt`. The list `cnt` contains all keys in the dictionary `M` where the value equals 1. Since there are at least two keys in `M` with a value of 1, `cnt` has at least two elements, and `cur` is the second element in this list.

Output: **the second key in M with a value of 1**
