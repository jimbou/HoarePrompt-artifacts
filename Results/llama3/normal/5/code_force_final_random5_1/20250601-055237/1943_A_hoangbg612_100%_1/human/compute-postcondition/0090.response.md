Output State: **T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, _ is 2, stdin contains T-5 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is an empty list, k is the last key in M, and the value of cur is being printed**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of T remains greater than 2. The value of S has been updated to an integer read from the input. The list N now contains a sorted list of integers read from the input. The dictionary M has been reset to an empty dictionary. The variable cur has been set to -1. The value of _ remains 2. There are now T-5 test cases left in the input. The variable num still refers to the last integer in the list. The list cnt is now empty. The variable k still refers to the last key in the dictionary M, but since M is empty, k is no longer a valid key. The value of cur, which is -1, is being printed.
