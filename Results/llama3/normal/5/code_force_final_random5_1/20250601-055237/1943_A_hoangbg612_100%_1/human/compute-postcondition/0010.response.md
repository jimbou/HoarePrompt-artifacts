Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 1 integer, cur is -1, M is a dictionary with M[-1] = 1, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the first integer in the list, and num is less than or equal to cur**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1, resulting in M[-1] = 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with T still being at least 1, S still being an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N still being a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1, cur still being -1, and stdin still containing T-1 test cases. Additionally, num is still the first integer in the list and is still less than or equal to cur.
