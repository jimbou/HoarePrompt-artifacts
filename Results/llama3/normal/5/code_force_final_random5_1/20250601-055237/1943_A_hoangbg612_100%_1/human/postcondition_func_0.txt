This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It processes each test case by sorting the integers, identifying consecutive sequences, and counting their occurrences. If there are at least two sequences with a single occurrence, it returns the second smallest integer from these sequences. Otherwise, it returns the next integer after the largest sequence. The function prints the result for each test case.
