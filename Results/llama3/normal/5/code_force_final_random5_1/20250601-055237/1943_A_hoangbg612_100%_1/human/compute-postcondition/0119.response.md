Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one integer, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in `M`, `_` is 2, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `num` is the last integer in the original list `N`, `k` is the first key in `M`, and `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus one if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`. The current value of `M[k]` is 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that `cnt` is no longer an empty list, but now contains the first key in `M`, which is `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
