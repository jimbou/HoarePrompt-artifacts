Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is an empty dictionary, stdin contains T-5 test cases, num is the first integer in the list N, cnt is an empty list, k is the last key in M. If the current value of num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is 0. Otherwise, the value of cur remains -1.***
