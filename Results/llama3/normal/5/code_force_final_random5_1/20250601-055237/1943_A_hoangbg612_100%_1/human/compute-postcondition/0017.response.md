Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the second integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1.***
