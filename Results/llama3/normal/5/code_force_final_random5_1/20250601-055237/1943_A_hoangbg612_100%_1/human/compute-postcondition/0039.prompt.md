Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `N` is a list, `stdin` contains `T-1` test cases, `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list `N` and the values are the counts of each integer in the list, `cnt` is an empty list. If the sum of the counts of all integers in the list `N` is equal to `S`, then the current value of the sum of the counts of all integers in the list `N` is equal to `S`.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 1 key, cnt is a list containing the first key in the dictionary M if the count of the first key in the dictionary M is 1, otherwise cnt is an empty list, k is the first key in the dictionary M

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 2 keys. If the count of the second key in the dictionary M is 1, then cnt is a list containing the second key in the dictionary M, otherwise cnt is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 2 keys, and the first key has been iterated over. If the count of the second key in the dictionary M is 1, then cnt is a list containing the second key in the dictionary M and the key k that was just appended. If the count of the second key in the dictionary M is not 1, then cnt is an empty list and now contains the key k that was just appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
