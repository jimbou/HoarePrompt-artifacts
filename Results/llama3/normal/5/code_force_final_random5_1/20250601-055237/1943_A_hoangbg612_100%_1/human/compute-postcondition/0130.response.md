Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a list with at least one integer, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is an integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, num is the last integer in the original list N, k is the last key in M. If there are at least two keys in M with a value of 1, cur is the second element in cnt, and cnt is a list containing all keys in M where the value equals 1 and has at least two elements. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
