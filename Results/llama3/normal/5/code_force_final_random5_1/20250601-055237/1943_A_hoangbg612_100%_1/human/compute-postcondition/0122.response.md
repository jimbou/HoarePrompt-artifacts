Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one integer, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, otherwise `cnt` is a list containing the second key in `M`, `_` is 2, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `num` is the last integer in the original list `N`, `k` is the second key in `M`, and `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus one if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to include the second key in `M`, which is `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
