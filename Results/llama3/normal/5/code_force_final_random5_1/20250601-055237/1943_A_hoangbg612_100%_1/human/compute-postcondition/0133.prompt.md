Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, if there are at least two keys in the original dictionary M that have a count of 1, then cur is the second key in the original dictionary M that has a count of 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of cur is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs, if the length of cnt is two or more, cur is the second element in cnt, otherwise, cur remains unchanged, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1, k is the last key in M, and the value of cur is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a list with at least one integer, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is an integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, num is the last integer in the original list N, k is the last key in M. If there are at least two keys in M with a value of 1, cur is the second element in cnt, and cnt is a list containing all keys in M where the value equals 1 and has at least two elements. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The value of cur is being printed, where cur is the second element in cnt which is a list containing all keys in M where the value equals 1 and has at least two elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
