Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list. If the sum of the counts of all integers in the list N is equal to S, then the current value of the sum of the counts of all integers in the list N is equal to S. Otherwise, the program does not change the state of the variables.***
