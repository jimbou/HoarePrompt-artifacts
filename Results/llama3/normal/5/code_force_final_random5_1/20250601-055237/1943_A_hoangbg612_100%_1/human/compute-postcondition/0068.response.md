Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs, cur is an integer, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the last integer in the list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of T remains greater than 1.
*   The value of S remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
*   The list N becomes empty because all its elements have been processed by the loop.
*   The dictionary M contains one or more key-value pairs, where each key is an integer from the list N and the corresponding value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer in the list.
*   The value of cur is an integer, which is the last integer processed by the loop.
*   The value of \_ remains 1.
*   The stdin contains T-3 test cases, indicating that the loop has executed three times.
*   The value of num is the last integer in the list N.
