Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs, cur is an integer and equals to cur+1 if the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise remains unchanged, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, cur is an integer and equals to cur+1 if the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise remains unchanged, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is a list containing the key k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1 if M[k] is 1, otherwise cnt is an empty list, k is a key in M

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, cur is an integer and equals to cur+1 if the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise remains unchanged, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is a list containing the key k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1 if M[k] is 1, otherwise cnt is an empty list, k is another key in M. If M[k] is 1, cnt has one more element which is k.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, cur is an integer and equals to cur+1 if the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise remains unchanged, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is a list containing the key k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1 if M[k] is 1, otherwise cnt is an empty list, k is another key in M. If M[k] is 1, cnt has one more element which is k. If M[k] is not 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
