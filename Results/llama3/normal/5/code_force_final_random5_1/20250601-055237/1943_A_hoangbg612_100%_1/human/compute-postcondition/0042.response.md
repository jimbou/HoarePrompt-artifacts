Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, if there are at least two keys in the original dictionary M that have a count of 1, then cur is the second key in the original dictionary M that has a count of 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
