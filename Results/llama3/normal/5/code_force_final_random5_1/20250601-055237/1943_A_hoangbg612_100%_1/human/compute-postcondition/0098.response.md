Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value greater than 0, `cur` is -1, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `T-5` test cases, `num` is the first integer in the list `N`, `cnt` is an empty list, `k` is -1, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still greater than 2, `S` is still an integer, and `N` is still a sorted list of integers with at least one integer. The dictionary `M` now has a key `-1` with a value greater than 0, because we incremented its value by 1. The value of `cur` is still `-1`. The value of `_` is still 2. There are still `T-5` test cases in `stdin`. The value of `num` is still the first integer in the list `N`. The list `cnt` is still empty. The value of `k` is now `-1`, because it is the last key in `M`. Finally, `num` is still less than or equal to `cur`.
