To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for num in N:` and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head only involves the variable `num` and the list `N`. To execute the loop again, `N` must have at least one more integer, and `num` should be the next integer in the list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `T` is greater than 2
* `S` is an integer
* `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer
* `stdin` contains `T-5` test cases
* `cnt` is an empty list
* `_` is 2
* If the first integer in the list `N` is greater than -1, `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `N` and the value is 1, `num` is the first integer in the list `N`, `k` is the first integer in the list `N`, and `cur` is the first integer in the list `N`. Otherwise, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value greater than 0, `num` is less than or equal to -1, `k` is -1, and `cur` is -1.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next integer in the list `N`. Since `N` is a sorted list, the next integer should be greater than or equal to the current first integer in the list.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains `T-5` test cases, `cnt` is an empty list, `_` is 2, `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list `N` and the value is 1, `num` is the second integer in the list `N`, `k` is the second integer in the list `N`, and `cur` is the second integer in the list `N`**
