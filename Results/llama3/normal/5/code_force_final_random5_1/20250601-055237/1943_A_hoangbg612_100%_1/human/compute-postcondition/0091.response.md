To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If the list `N` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. 

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `T-5` test cases, `num` is the first integer in the list `N`, `cnt` is an empty list, `k` is the last key in `M`**
