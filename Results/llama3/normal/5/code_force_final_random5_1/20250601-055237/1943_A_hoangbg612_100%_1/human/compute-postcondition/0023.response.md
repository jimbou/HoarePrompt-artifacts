Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the third integer in the list. If num is larger than cur, cur is updated to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1.***
