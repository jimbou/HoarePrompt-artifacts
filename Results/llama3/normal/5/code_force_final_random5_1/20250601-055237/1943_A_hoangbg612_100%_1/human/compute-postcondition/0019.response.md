Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains T-2 test cases, num is the third integer in the list, cur is incremented by 1.**

The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1 and then breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is part of. The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables, but it does change the flow of the program by exiting the current loop or conditional block. 

The initial state of `cur` is not provided, so we can only say that its value is incremented by 1. The values of `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1 due to the `break` statement, which exits the loop that is likely reading these test cases. The value of `num` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
