Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is an empty dictionary, cnt is a list containing all keys in the original dictionary M that have a count of 1, k is the last key in the original dictionary M.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over all keys in the dictionary M, and the list cnt contains all keys from the original dictionary M that have a count of 1. The dictionary M is now empty, and the variable k holds the last key that was iterated over. The other variables remain unchanged.
