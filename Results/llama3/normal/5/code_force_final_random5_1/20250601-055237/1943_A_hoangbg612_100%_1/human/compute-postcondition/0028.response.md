Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `N` is a list, `stdin` contains `T-1` test cases, `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list `N` and the values are the counts of each integer in the list, `cnt` is an empty list. If the sum of the counts of all integers in the list `N` is equal to `S`, then the current value of the sum of the counts of all integers in the list `N` is equal to `S`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `cnt` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The program does not change the state of the variables because the given code only declares an empty list `cnt` without modifying any existing variables.
