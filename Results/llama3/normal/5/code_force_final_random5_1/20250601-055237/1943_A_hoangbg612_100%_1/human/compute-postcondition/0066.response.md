Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary with one or two key-value pairs where the value of the key 'cur' is increased by 1, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, and num is the third integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of the key 'cur' in the dictionary M has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with T still greater than 1, S still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N still a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, _ still 1, stdin still containing T-3 test cases, and num still the third integer in the list.
