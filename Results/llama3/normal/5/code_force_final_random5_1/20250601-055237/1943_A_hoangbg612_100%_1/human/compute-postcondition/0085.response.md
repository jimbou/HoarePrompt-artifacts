Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs, cur is the second element in cnt, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1, k is the last key in M. The current value of cnt has two or more elements.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 1, S is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is still an empty list, M is still a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs, cur is now the second element in cnt, _ is still 1, stdin still contains T-3 test cases, num is still the last integer in the list, cnt is still a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1, k is still the last key in M. The current value of cnt still has two or more elements.
