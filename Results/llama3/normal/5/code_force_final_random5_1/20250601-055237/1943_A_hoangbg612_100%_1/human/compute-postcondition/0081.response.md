Output State: **T is greater than 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, cur is an integer and equals to cur+1 if the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise remains unchanged, _ is 1, stdin contains T-3 test cases, num is the last integer in the list, cnt is a list containing the key k from dictionary M where M[k] is 1 if M[k] is 1, otherwise cnt is an empty list, k is another key in M. If M[k] is 1, cnt has one more element which is k.**

The code appends the key k from dictionary M to the list cnt. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of cnt is updated to include the key k from dictionary M.
