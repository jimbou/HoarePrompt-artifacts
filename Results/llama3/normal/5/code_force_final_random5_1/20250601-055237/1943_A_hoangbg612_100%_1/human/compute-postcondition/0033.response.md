To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `k` and `M`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more keys in the dictionary `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `M` has at least 1 key, and `k` is the first key in the dictionary `M`.

For the loop to execute again, `M` must have at least 2 keys, and `k` must be the second key in the dictionary `M`.

State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 2 keys, cnt is a list containing the second key in the dictionary M if the count of the second key in the dictionary M is 1, otherwise cnt is an empty list, k is the second key in the dictionary M**
