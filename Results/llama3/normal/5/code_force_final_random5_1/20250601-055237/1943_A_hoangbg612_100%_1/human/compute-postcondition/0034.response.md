Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 2 keys, cnt is a list containing the second key in the dictionary M, k is the second key in the dictionary M**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T remains at least 1, S remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N remains a list, stdin still contains T-1 test cases, cur remains the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M remains a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list and has at least 2 keys, cnt is now a list containing the second key in the dictionary M, and k remains the second key in the dictionary M.
