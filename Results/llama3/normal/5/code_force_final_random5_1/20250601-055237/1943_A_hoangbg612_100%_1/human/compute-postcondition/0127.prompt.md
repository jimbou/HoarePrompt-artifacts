Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is an integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, num is the last integer in the original list N, k is the last key in M, and cur is the last integer in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus one.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a list with at least one integer, cnt is a list containing the first key in M if M[k] equals 1, otherwise cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, num is the last integer in the original list N, k is the first key in M, and cur is the last integer in the original list N plus one if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one integer, `_` is 2, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `num` is the last integer in the original list `N`, and `k` is the second key in `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in `M`. Otherwise, `cnt` is a list containing the second key in `M`. Additionally, `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus one if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is greater than 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one integer, `_` is 2, `M` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `num` is the last integer in the original list `N`, and `k` is the third key in `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in `M` followed by `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` is a list containing the third key in `M` followed by `k`. Additionally, `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus one if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
