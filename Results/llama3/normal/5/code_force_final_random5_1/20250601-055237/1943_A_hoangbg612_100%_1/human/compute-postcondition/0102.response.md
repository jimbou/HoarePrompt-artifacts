Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains T-5 test cases, cnt is an empty list, _ is 2, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second integer in the list N and the value is 1, num is the second integer in the list N, k is the second integer in the list N, and if the second integer in the list N is greater than the second integer in the list N plus 1, then cur is the second integer in the list N plus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
