Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a sorted list of S integers between 0 and S-1 that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains T-1 test cases, num is the first integer in the list, cur is equal to num, and M is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is cur (which is equal to num) and the value is 1.**

In this final state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, which is the first integer in the list `N`. The dictionary `M` now contains a single key-value pair where the key is `cur` (which is equal to `num`) and the value is 1. All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
