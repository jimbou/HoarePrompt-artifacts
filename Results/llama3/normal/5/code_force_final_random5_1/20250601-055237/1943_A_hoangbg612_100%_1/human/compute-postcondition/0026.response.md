Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, N is a list, stdin contains T-1 test cases, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list N and the values are the counts of each integer in the list. The current value of the sum of the counts of all integers in the list N is equal to S.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cur` is now the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1. The rest of the variables, including `T`, `S`, `N`, `stdin`, and `M`, retain their original values and properties.
