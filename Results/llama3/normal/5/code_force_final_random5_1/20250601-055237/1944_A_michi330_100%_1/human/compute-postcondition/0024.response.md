Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `i` is `t`, `n` and `k` are integers that were previously in stdin and are now assigned to `n` and `k` respectively, `stdin` contains 0 lines of input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n` and `k` will be the last values read from `stdin`, and `stdin` will be empty since all input lines have been processed. The loop will have printed either 1 or the value of `n` for each iteration, depending on the condition `k >= n - 1`.
