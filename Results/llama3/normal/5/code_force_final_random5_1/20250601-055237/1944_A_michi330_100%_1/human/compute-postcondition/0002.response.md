Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `stdin` contains (t-2) lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0 as it was not modified. The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since the input contains multiple lines of input, after reading one line, `(t-2)` lines of input remain in the `stdin`.
