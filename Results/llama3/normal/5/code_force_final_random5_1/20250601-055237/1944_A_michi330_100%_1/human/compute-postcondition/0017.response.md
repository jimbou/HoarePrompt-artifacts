To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head. The states of `n`, `k`, and `stdin` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers, `stdin` contains (t-3) lines of input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` is printed.**
