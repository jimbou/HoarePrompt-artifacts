The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `stdin` contains (t-2) lines of input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` is printed.**
