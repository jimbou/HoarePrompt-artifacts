Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

In the initial state, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) â€” the number of test cases.

When the code is executed, the first line of input is read, and the integer value is assigned to `t`. Since the input is consumed, the remaining lines of input are still present in `stdin`.

The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).

The output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), and `stdin` contains multiple lines of input (t-1 lines remaining).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `stdin` contains multiple lines of input (t-1 lines remaining)**
