To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input (t-1 lines remaining)**
