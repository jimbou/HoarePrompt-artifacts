Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers, `stdin` contains (t-3) lines of input.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to be integers, as they are assigned the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which converts the input to integers. The `stdin` now contains `(t-3)` lines of input, as one line of input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
