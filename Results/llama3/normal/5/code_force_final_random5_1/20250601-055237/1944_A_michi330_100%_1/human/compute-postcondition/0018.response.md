Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers that were previously in stdin and are now assigned to `n` and `k` respectively, `stdin` contains (t-4) lines of input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers that were previously in `stdin` and are now assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The `stdin` now contains (t-4) lines of input. The condition that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then 1 is printed, otherwise, the value of `n` is printed, is still valid.
