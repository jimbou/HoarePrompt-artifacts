The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `pb` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, `ps` is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, `p` is a list of integers from the second line of the input, `a` is a list of integers from the third line of the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is 1, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with an additional element maxa, `s` is a list of integers with an additional element maxa if `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[ps - 1]` and an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `preb` is a list of integers, `pres` is a list of integers, `sb` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `rem` is an integer, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `ptsb` is a list of integers, `ptss` is a list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is False.**
