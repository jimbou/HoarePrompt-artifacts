According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must have at least 1 test case and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **`stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0**
