Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with `k` additional elements, `s` is a list of integers with `k` additional elements, `preb` is a list containing `sb` + `b[i]` repeated `len(s)` times, `pres` is a list containing `ss` + `s[i]` repeated `len(s)` times, `sb` is `sb` + `len(s)` * `b[i]`, `ss` is `ss` + `len(s)` * `s[i]`, `rem` is 0, `maxs` is an integer, `maxb` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `ptsb` and `ptss` have been updated to empty lists, while all other variables remain unchanged.
