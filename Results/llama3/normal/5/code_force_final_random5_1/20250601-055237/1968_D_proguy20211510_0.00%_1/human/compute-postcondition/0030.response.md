Postcondition: ***`n`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `_` retain their initial values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. `foundb` is False. If `founds` is True, then `s` is a list containing the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. `b` is an empty list. The element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` is not equal to `maxa`.***
