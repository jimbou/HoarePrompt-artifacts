Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to 0, pb is an integer equal to the third integer from the input if founds is True or a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise pb is equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list p if foundb is False and a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa, ps is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise ps is equal to the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers from the second line of the input, a is a list of integers from the third line of the input, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is equal to the length of s, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa if founds is True, otherwise b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1], and a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa if founds is True, otherwise s is a list of integers with k elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise s is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: a[ps - 1], maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1], preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is an integer equal to 0, ss is an integer equal to 0, rem is an integer, maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
