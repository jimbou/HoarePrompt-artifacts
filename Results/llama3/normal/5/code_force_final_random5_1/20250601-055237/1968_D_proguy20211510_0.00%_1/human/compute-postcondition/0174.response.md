Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with k additional elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) times and must have at least 1 element, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1), maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i].**

In this output state, the variables n, k, maxa, i, founds, foundb, b, s, preb, pres, sb, ss, maxs, maxb, p, a, pb, and ps retain their initial values. The variable rem is updated to k - (i + 1), which is k - 1 since i is 0. The lists ptsb and ptss are updated to contain the values preb[i] + rem * b[i] and pres[i] + rem * s[i], respectively.
