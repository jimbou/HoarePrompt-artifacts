Output State: **`n`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `_` retain their initial values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. `foundb` is False. If `founds` is True, then `s` is a list containing the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list. The element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` is not equal to `maxa`. `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]`.**

The code snippet modifies the variables `b` and `pb`. The first line appends the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` to list `b`. The second line assigns the value of `p[pb - 1]` to `pb`. The values of `n`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `_`, `k`, `i`, `foundb`, and `s` remain unchanged.
