Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to 0, `pb` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input if `founds` is True or `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is equal to the value at index `pb - 1` in list `p` if `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `ps` is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `ps` is equal to the value at index `ps - 1` in list `p`, `p` is a list of integers from the second line of the input, `a` is a list of integers from the third line of the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `s` + (the number of iterations - 1), `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with `k` elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `a[ps - 1]`, `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `a[ps - 1]`, `preb` is a list of integers with (the number of iterations) elements: `sb` + `b[i]`, `sb` + `b[i]` + `b[i]`, ..., `sb` + `b[i]` + `b[i]` + ... + `b[i]`, `pres` is a list of integers with (the number of iterations) elements: `ss` + `s[i]`, `ss` + `s[i]` + `s[i]`, ..., `ss` + `s[i]` + `s[i]` + ... + `s[i]`, `sb` is an integer equal to `b[i]` + `b[i]` + ... + `b[i]`, `ss` is an integer equal to `s[i]` + `s[i]` + ... + `s[i]`, `rem` is an integer, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `s` is not empty and has at least (the number of iterations - 1) more elements.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ptsb` and `ptss` are now empty lists. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
