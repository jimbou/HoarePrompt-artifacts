Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, k, maxa retain their initial values, i is k - 1, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa, s is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, and ss is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, k, maxa retain their initial values, i is 0, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa, s is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa that must have at least 1 element, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], sb is sb + b[i], and ss is ss + s[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, k, maxa retain their initial values, i is 1, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa, s is a list containing at least 2 elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], ss + s[i] + s[i], sb is sb + b[i] + b[i], and ss is ss + s[i] + s[i]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, k, maxa retain their initial values, i is 2, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa, s is a list containing at least 3 elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i] + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], ss + s[i] + s[i], ss + s[i] + s[i] + s[i], sb is sb + b[i] + b[i] + b[i], and ss is ss + s[i] + s[i] + s[i]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
