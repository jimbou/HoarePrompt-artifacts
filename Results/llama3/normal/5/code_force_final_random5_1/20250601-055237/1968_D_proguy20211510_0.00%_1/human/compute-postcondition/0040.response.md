Output State: **`n`, `k`, `i`, `founds`, `maxa` retain their initial values, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `s` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`, and `a`, `p`, `foundb`, `pb`, and `b` retain their initial values.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `founds`, and `maxa` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, which means it now points to the previous element in the `p` list. The list `s` now contains the element `a[ps - 1]`, which was appended by the first line of the code. The values of `a`, `p`, `foundb`, `pb`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
