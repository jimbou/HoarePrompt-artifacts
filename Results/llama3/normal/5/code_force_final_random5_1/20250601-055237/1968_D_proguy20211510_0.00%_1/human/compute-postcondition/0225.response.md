Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer greater than 0, pb is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, ps is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, p is a list of integers from the second line of the input, a is a list of integers from the third line of the input, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with an additional element maxa, s is a list of integers with an additional element maxa, preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, rem is an integer, maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `founds` and `s`. The first line sets `founds` to `True`. The second line appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to `s`. Since `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `s` now contains an additional element `maxa`. No other variables are affected.
