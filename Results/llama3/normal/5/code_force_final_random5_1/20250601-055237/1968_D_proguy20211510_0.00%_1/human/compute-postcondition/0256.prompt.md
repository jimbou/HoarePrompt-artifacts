Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, pb is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, ps is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, p is a list of integers from the second line of the input, a is a list of integers from the third line of the input, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is equal to the length of s, founds is False, foundb is False, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, rem is 0, maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, `ps` is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, `p` is a list of integers from the second line of the input, `a` is a list of integers from the third line of the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is 0, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with an additional element maxa, `s` is a list of integers with an additional element maxa if `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[ps - 1]` and an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `preb` is a list of integers, `pres` is a list of integers, `sb` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `rem` is an integer, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `ptsb` is a list of integers, `ptss` is a list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer greater than 1, pb is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, ps is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, p is a list of integers from the second line of the input, a is a list of integers from the third line of the input, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 1, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with three additional elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and maxa if foundb is True and founds is True, otherwise b is a list of integers with three elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with three additional elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers with three additional elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and maxa if founds is True, otherwise s is a list of integers with two additional elements: maxa and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise s is a list of integers with three additional elements: a[ps - 1], maxa, and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, rem is an integer, maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `pb` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input if `founds` is True or `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is equal to the value at index `pb - 1` in list `p` if `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `ps` is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `ps` is equal to the value at index `ps - 1` in list `p`, `p` is a list of integers from the second line of the input, `a` is a list of integers from the third line of the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is 2, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with five elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with five elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with five elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list of integers with five elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with four elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with five elements: `a[ps - 1]`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[ps - 1]`, `preb` is a list of integers, `pres` is a list of integers, `sb` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `rem` is an integer, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `ptsb` is a list of integers, `ptss` is a list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
