Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to 0, `pb` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input if `founds` is True or `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is equal to the value at index `pb - 1` in list `p` if `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `ps` is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `ps` is equal to the value at index `ps - 1` in list `p`, `p` is a list of integers from the second line of the input, `a` is a list of integers from the third line of the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `s` + (the number of iterations - 1), `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with `k` elements: `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with `k` + 1 elements: `a[ps - 1]`, `maxa`, (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`, `a[ps - 1]`, `preb` is a list of integers with (the number of iterations) elements: `sb` + `b[i]`, `sb` + `b[i]` + `b[i]`, ..., `sb` + `b[i]` + `b[i]` + ... + `b[i]`, `pres` is a list of integers with (the number of iterations) elements: `ss` + `s[i]`, `ss` + `s[i]` + `s[i]`, ..., `ss` + `s[i]` + `s[i]` + ... + `s[i]`, `sb` is an integer equal to `b[i]` + `b[i]` + ... + `b[i]`, `ss` is an integer equal to `s[i]` + `s[i]` + ... + `s[i]`, `rem` is an integer, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `s` is not empty and has at least (the number of iterations - 1) more elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pres)):
    rem = k - (i + 1)
    ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
    ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
