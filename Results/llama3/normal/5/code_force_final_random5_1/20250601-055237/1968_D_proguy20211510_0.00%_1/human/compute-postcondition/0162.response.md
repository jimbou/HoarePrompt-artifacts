Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is greater than 2, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, maxb is an integer, maxs is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers, preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k - 1. If foundb is True, then b is a list of integers with an additional element maxa. If foundb is False, then pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If founds is True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element maxa. If founds is False, then ps is updated to p[ps - 1]. If foundb and founds are both True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
