Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer greater than 2, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list p, ps is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, p is a list of integers from the second line of the input, a is a list of integers from the third line of the input, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with five elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa if foundb is True and founds is True, otherwise b is a list of integers with five elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with five elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers with four elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa if founds is True, otherwise s is a list of integers with three elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise s is a list of integers with four elements: a[ps - 1], maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[ps - 1], preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, rem is an integer, maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The first line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the end of list `b`. This modifies the list `b` by adding a new element. The second line assigns the value at index `pb - 1` in list `p` to `pb`. This changes the value of `pb` to the value at the specified index in list `p`. No other variables are affected.
