Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in list a, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the 2 lines of input that were read**

The first line reads a line of input from stdin and assigns the values to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The second line converts these values to integers. The third line reads another line of input from stdin and assigns the values to `p`. The fourth line reads a third line of input from stdin and assigns the values to `a`. The fifth line assigns the maximum value in `a` to `maxa`. The variable `_` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus the 2 lines of input that were read.
