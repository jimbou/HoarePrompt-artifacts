Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 1, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with k additional elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) times and must have at least 2 elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], rem is 0, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i] and preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i] and pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i].**

In this output state, the value of `rem` has been updated to 0, as it is now equal to `k - (i + 1)`. The lists `ptsb` and `ptss` have been appended with new elements, which are the result of adding `rem * b[i]` and `rem * s[i]` to `preb[i]` and `pres[i]`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
