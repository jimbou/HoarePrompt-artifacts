Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `pb` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, `ps` is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, `p` is a list of integers from the second line of the input, `a` is a list of integers from the third line of the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is 1, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with three additional elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `maxa` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with three elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with three additional elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list of integers with three additional elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `maxa`, `preb` is a list of integers, `pres` is a list of integers, `sb` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `rem` is an integer, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `ptsb` is a list of integers, `ptss` is a list of integers, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The code appends `maxa` to the list `s`, so the list `s` now has three additional elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `maxa`. The other variables remain unchanged.
