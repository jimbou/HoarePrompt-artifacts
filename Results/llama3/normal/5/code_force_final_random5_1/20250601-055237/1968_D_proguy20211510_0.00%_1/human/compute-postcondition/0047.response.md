Output State: **n, k, maxa retain their initial values, i is i + 1, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[pb - 1], and s is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `maxa` remain unchanged from their initial values. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. Both `foundb` and `founds` are still True. The list `b` now contains four elements: `(k - (i + 2)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the value of `a[pb - 1]`, which was appended to `b` by the code. The list `s` remains unchanged, containing the elements `(k - (i + 2)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
