Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is False, foundb is False, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, rem is k, maxs is 0, maxb is 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement does not affect any variable values but rather controls the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the loop.
