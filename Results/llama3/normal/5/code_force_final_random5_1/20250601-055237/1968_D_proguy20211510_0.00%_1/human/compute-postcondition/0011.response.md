Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in list `a`, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the 2 lines of input that were read. Either `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]` or `a[pb - 1]` or `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. The current value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, and 'Bodya' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the `continue` statement are still true. The only difference is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop, without executing the rest of the code inside the current iteration.
