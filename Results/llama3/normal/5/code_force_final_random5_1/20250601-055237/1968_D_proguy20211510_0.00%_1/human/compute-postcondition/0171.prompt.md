Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is equal to k, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with k additional elements, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is 0, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with at least 1 element, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], sb is sb + b[i], ss is ss + s[i], ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is 0, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 1, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated twice, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated twice, sb is sb + 2 * b[i], ss is ss + 2 * s[i], ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is 0, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated three times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated three times, sb is sb + 3 * b[i], ss is ss + 3 * s[i], ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is 0, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, stdin contains no input




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
