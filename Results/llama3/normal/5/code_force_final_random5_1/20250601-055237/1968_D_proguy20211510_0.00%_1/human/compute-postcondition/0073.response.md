Output State: **n, k, maxa retain their initial values, i is 0, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa, s is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa that must have at least 1 element, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], sb is sb + b[i], and ss is ss + s[i].**

In this output state, the values of n, k, and maxa remain unchanged. The value of i remains 0. The values of founds and foundb also remain True. The lists b and s retain their initial elements. The list preb now contains the sum of sb and the first element of b, and the list pres contains the sum of ss and the first element of s. The values of sb and ss are incremented by the first elements of b and s, respectively.
