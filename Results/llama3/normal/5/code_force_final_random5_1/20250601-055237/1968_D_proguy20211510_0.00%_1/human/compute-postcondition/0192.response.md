Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with `k` additional elements, `s` is a list of integers with `k` additional elements, `preb` is a list containing `sb` + `b[i]` repeated `len(s)` times, `pres` is a list containing `ss` + `s[i]` repeated `len(s)` times, `sb` is `sb` + `len(s)` * `b[i]`, `ss` is `ss` + `len(s)` * `s[i]`, `rem` is 0, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[i]` + `rem` * `b[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(pres)`), `ptss` is a list containing `pres[i]` + `rem` * `s[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(pres)`). If the maximum value in `ptss` is higher than the maximum value in `ptsb`, 'Sasha' is printed. If the maximum value in `ptss` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `ptsb`, 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, if the maximum value in `ptss` is larger than or equal to the maximum value in `ptsb`, 'Draw' is printed.***
