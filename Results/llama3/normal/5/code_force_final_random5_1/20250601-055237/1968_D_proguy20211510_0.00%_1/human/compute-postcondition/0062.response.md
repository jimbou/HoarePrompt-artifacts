Output State: **n retains its initial value, k retains its initial value and is greater than i + 1, maxa retains its initial value, i is i + 2, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 3)) * maxa, maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[pb - 1], and s is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 3)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and pb is p[pb - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `maxa`, `founds`, and `foundb` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The list `b` has an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it. The list `s` remains unchanged. The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
