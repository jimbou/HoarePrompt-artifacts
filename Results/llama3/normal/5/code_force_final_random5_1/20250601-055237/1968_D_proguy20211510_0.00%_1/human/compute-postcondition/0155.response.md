Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than 2, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, maxb is an integer, maxs is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, b is a list of integers with an additional element a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers, preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k - 1. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s are lists of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The code modifies the state of the variables as follows:

* The first line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. This means that `b` now has an additional element, which is the value of `a[pb - 1]`.
* The second line assigns the value of `p[pb - 1]` to `pb`. This means that `pb` now has a new value, which is the value of `p[pb - 1]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `foundb` is still True if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, and False otherwise. The value of `foundb` and `founds` being both True is still a condition for `b` and `s` to have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
