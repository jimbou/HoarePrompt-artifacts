Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than 0, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, stdin contains no input. The current value of a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa.**

The first line sets `foundb` to `True`. The second line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, the list `b` now contains an additional element equal to `maxa`. No other variables are affected.
