Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in list a, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the 2 lines of input that were read, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
