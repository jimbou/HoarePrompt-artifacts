The provided code snippet defines several constants: `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha`. These constants are assigned specific values, but they do not depend on any variables or inputs from stdin. As a result, the execution of this code snippet does not affect the state of any variables or stdin.

The initial state of stdin, which contains multiple test cases, remains unchanged because the code does not read or modify any input from stdin.

Here is the final output state:

Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) on the first line, a list of n integers (p_1, ..., p_n) on the second line, and a list of n integers (a_1, ..., a_n) on the third line. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. p_i and a_i are positive integers for all i. YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 10^9 + 7, and alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
