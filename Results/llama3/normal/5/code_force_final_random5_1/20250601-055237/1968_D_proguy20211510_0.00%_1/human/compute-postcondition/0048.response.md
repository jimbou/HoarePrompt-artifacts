Output State: **n, k, maxa retain their initial values, i is i + 1, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[pb - 1], s is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, pb is p[pb - 1].**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `maxa` remain unchanged. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` are still True. The list `b` has been appended with the element `a[pb - 1]`, in addition to its initial elements `(k - (i + 2)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The list `s` remains unchanged, containing the elements `(k - (i + 2)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The value of `pb` has been updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
