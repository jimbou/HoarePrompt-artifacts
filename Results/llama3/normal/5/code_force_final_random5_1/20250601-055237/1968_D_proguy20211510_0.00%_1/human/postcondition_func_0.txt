This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) and two lists of n integers (p_1, ..., p_n) and (a_1, ..., a_n). It determines the winner of a game based on the values of a_1, ..., a_n and the indices P_B and P_S, and prints the result as 'Sasha', 'Bodya', or 'Draw' for each test case. The function does not modify the input variables and only prints the results to the console.
