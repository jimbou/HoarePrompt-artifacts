Output: **`n`, `k`, `maxa`, `i`, `founds`, `foundb`, `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `rem`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `ptsb`, `ptss` are as described in the precondition. Additionally, the maximum value in `ptss` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `ptsb`. The current value of `maxs` is less than the current value of `maxb`. and 'Bodya' is printed**
