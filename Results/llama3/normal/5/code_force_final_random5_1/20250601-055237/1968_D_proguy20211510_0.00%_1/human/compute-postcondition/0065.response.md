Output State: **n retains its initial value, k retains its initial value and is greater than i + 1, maxa retains its initial value, i is i + 2, founds is True, foundb is True. If foundb is True, then b is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 3)) * maxa, maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and maxa, and s is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 3)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and maxa. If foundb is False, then b is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 3)) * maxa, maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[pb - 1], and s is a list containing the elements (k - (i + 3)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and maxa. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, then the postcondition is the same as the if part. Otherwise, pb is set to p[pb - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the list `s` has an additional element `maxa` appended to it. The values of `n`, `k`, `maxa`, `i`, `founds`, and `foundb` remain the same. The list `b` remains the same as well, with its elements still dependent on the value of `foundb`.
