Postcondition: ***`n`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `_` retain their initial values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `s` is a list containing the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, which is equal to `maxa`. Otherwise, `foundb` is False, `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is True, then `s` is a list containing the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Otherwise, `s` is an empty list.***
