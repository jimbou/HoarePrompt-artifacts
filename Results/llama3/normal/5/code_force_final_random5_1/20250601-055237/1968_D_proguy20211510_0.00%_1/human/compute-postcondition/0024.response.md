Postcondition: ***`n`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `_` retain their initial values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `b` is a list containing the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `s` is a list containing the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Otherwise, `b` and `s` are empty lists.***
