Output State: **The loop will execute until there are no more test cases in the input. After the loop finishes executing, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of the results of the loop's execution. The results will be a series of 'Sasha', 'Bodya', or 'Draw' printed to the console, depending on the outcome of each test case. The loop will not modify any of the input variables, so the state of the input will remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of the results of the loop's execution. The loop will print the results of each test case to the console, without modifying any of the input variables.
