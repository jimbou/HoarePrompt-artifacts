Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than 0, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is False, b is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa, s is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, stdin contains no input. a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa, ps is the value of p[ps - 1].**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Since `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, this operation adds a new element to the list `s`. The second line assigns the value of `p[ps - 1]` to `ps`. This operation updates the value of `ps` to be the value of `p[ps - 1]`. 

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer, `k` is still greater than 0, `maxa` is still the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is still 0, `founds` is still False, `b` is still a list of integers with two additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `preb` is still a list of integers, `pres` is still a list of integers, `sb` is still an integer, `ss` is still an integer, `ptsb` is still a list of integers, `ptss` is still a list of integers, `rem` is still `k`, `maxs` is still an integer, `maxb` is still an integer, `p` is still a list of integers, `a` is still a list of integers, `pb` is still an integer, `foundb` is still True if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `foundb` is still False, and `stdin` still contains no input.
