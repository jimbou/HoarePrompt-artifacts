Postcondition: ***n, k, pb, ps, p, a, maxa, _ retain their initial values. If a[pb - 1] is equal to a[ps - 1] and both are equal to maxa, we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa but a[ps - 1] is not, 'Bodya' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa but a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, 'Sasha' is printed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If neither a[pb - 1] nor a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, no action is taken.***
