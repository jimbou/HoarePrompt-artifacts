Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than 0, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, foundb is False, founds is True, b is a list of integers with an additional element a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, stdin contains no input. The element at index (pb - 1) in list a is not equal to maxa.**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` to list `b`. Since the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` is not equal to `maxa`, list `b` now contains an additional element that is not the maximum value in list `a`. The second line assigns the value of `p[pb - 1]` to `pb`. This changes the value of `pb` to the value at index `pb - 1` in list `p`. No other variables are affected.
