Output State: **`n`, `k`, `maxa` retain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True. If `foundb` is True, then `b` is a list containing the elements `(k - (i + 2)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `maxa`, and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `s` is a list containing the elements `(k - (i + 2)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then `b` is a list containing the elements `(k - (i + 2)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` is a list containing the elements `(k - (i + 2)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `maxa`. Additionally, if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `s` has an additional element `maxa` appended to it. The values of `n`, `k`, `maxa`, `i`, `founds`, and `foundb` remain unchanged. The lists `b` and `s` are updated according to their initial conditions, with `s` now containing an additional `maxa` element.
