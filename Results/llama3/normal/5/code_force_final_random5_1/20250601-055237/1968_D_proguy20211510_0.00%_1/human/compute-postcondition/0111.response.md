Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is False, foundb is False, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, rem is k, maxs is 0, maxb is 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, and if the last element of list a is equal to maxa, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise no action is taken.**
