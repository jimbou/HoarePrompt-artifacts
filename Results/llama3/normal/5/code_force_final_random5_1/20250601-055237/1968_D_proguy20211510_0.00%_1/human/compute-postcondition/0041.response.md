Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `i`, `maxa` retain their initial values. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `s` is a list containing the element `maxa`, and `b` is a list containing the elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `s` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`, and `a`, `p`, `foundb`, `pb`, and `b` retain their initial values.***
