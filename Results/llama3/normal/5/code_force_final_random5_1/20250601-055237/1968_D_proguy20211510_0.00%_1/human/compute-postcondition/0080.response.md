According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pres`. If `pres` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `maxa`, `i`, `founds`, `foundb`, `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` retain their initial values. So for the loop to be executed  the list `pres` must have at least 1 element and the index `i` is 0.
State: **`n`, `k`, `maxa` retain their initial values, `i` is 0, `founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `True`, `b` is a list containing the elements `(k - (k)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (k - 1)) * maxa`, ..., `(k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing the elements `(k - (k)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (k - 1)) * maxa`, ..., `(k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa`, `preb` is a list containing `sb + b[i]`, `sb + b[i] + b[i]`, ..., `sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing at least one element `ss + s[i]`, `ss + s[i] + s[i]`, ..., `ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i]`, `ptsb` is an empty list, and `ptss` is an empty list.**
