Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the maximum value in the array `a` is not unique. In this case, the program assumes that the player who starts at the position with the maximum value will always win, which is not necessarily true. The program should consider the entire cycle of positions for each player, not just the starting position.

For example, consider the input:

```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

In this case, the maximum value in the array `a` is 7, which is at position 3. However, the program will incorrectly assume that Bodya will always win, because he starts at position 3. But if Sasha starts at position 2, he will move to position 1, which has a value of 2, and then he will move to position 4, which has a value of 5. So, Sasha's total score will be 2 + 5 = 7, which is the same as Bodya's score. Therefore, the program should output "Draw", but it will incorrectly output "Bodya".
