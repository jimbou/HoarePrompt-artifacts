Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is False, foundb is False, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, rem is k, maxs is 0, maxb is 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, stdin contains no input, 'Bodya' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The only additional information is that 'Bodya' is printed, which was already printed in the initial state.
