Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given inputs. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first checks if the maximum value in the array `a` is present at both `pb` and `ps` indices. If so, it prints 'Draw' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if both players have the maximum value at their starting positions, the game will end in a draw.

2. If the maximum value is present at only one of the indices, the program prints the corresponding player's name ('Bodya' or 'Sasha') and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the player with the maximum value at their starting position will always win the game.

3. If the maximum value is not present at either of the indices, the program simulates the game for `k` turns. It keeps track of the scores of both players and updates their positions based on the permutation `p`. This is correct because the game is simulated correctly according to the problem statement.

4. After simulating the game, the program calculates the total score for each player by adding the scores of all turns and the remaining turns (if any). It then compares the total scores and prints the winner's name ('Bodya' or 'Sasha') or 'Draw' if the scores are equal. This is correct because the total scores are calculated correctly and the winner is determined correctly.

5. The program uses a loop to process multiple test cases. It reads the input for each test case, processes it, and prints the result. This is correct because the program correctly handles multiple test cases.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given inputs, and it handles multiple test cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
