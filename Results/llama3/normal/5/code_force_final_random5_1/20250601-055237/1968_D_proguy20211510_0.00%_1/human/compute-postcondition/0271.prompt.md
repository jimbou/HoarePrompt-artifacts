You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state, icluding the state of all the variables after the execution of the code snippet. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer , stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin only contains one integer now. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer, stdin contains 1 input: an integer **

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1 , stdin contains a space-separated list of integers
```
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line assins to num a list of integers from stdin. Stdin is now empty so we dont include it in the output state.The second line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The thir line does not affect any variables. The 4th line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to 0, pb is an integer equal to the third integer from the input if founds is True or a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise pb is equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list p if foundb is False and a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa, ps is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise ps is equal to the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers from the second line of the input, a is a list of integers from the third line of the input, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa if founds is True, otherwise b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1], and a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa if founds is True, otherwise s is a list of integers with k elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise s is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: a[ps - 1], maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1], preb is a list of integers with (the number of iterations) elements: sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i], ..., sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i], pres is a list of integers with (the number of iterations + 1) elements: ss + s[i], ss + s[i] + s[i], ..., ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i] and must have at least 3 elements, sb is an integer equal to b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i], ss is an integer equal to s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i], rem is an integer equal to k - (i + 1), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, ptsb is a list with two elements: preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list with two elements: pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + rem * s[i], stdin contains 0 inputs, s is not empty and has at least (the number of iterations + 1) more elements
```
rem = k - (i + 1)
ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])

```
Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the states of the variables after the codeexecutes. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans
