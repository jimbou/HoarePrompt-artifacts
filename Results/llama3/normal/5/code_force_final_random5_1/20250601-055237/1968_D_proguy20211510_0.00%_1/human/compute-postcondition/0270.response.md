The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list pres, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the pres.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, pres has at least 2 elements, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is 2.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to 0, pb is an integer equal to the third integer from the input if founds is True or a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise pb is equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list p if foundb is False and a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa, ps is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise ps is equal to the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers from the second line of the input, a is a list of integers from the third line of the input, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa if founds is True, otherwise b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1], and a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa if founds is True, otherwise s is a list of integers with k elements: maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise s is a list of integers with k + 1 elements: a[ps - 1], maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1], preb is a list of integers with (the number of iterations) elements: sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i], ..., sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i], pres is a list of integers with (the number of iterations + 1) elements: ss + s[i], ss + s[i] + s[i], ..., ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i] and must have at least 3 elements, sb is an integer equal to b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i], ss is an integer equal to s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i], rem is an integer equal to k - (i + 1), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, ptsb is a list with two elements: preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list with two elements: pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + rem * s[i], stdin contains 0 inputs, s is not empty and has at least (the number of iterations + 1) more elements**
