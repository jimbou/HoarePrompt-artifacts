Output State: **n, k, maxa retain their initial values, i is 0, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa, s is a list containing the elements (k - (k)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (k - 1)) * maxa, ..., (k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i], ..., sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i], pres is a list containing at least one element ss + s[i], ss + s[i] + s[i], ..., ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i], sb is sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i], ss is ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i], ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1).**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for ptsb and ptss, which are now lists containing the results of the calculations preb[i] + rem * b[i] and pres[i] + rem * s[i], respectively. The variable rem is also updated to be k - (i + 1).
