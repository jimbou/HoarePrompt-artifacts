Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in list a, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the 2 lines of input that were read. Either a[pb - 1] is not equal to a[ps - 1] or a[pb - 1] or a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa. Additionally, a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa. The current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, and 'Sasha' is printed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we continue to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the current iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the continue statement are still true.
