Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with `k` additional elements, `s` is a list of integers with `k` additional elements, `preb` is a list containing `sb` + `b[i]` repeated `len(s)` times, `pres` is a list containing `ss` + `s[i]` repeated `len(s)` times, `sb` is `sb` + `len(s)` * `b[i]`, `ss` is `ss` + `len(s)` * `s[i]`, `rem` is 0, `maxs` is an integer, `maxb` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pres)):
    rem = k - (i + 1)
    ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
    ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with k additional elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) times and must have at least 1 element, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1), maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 1, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with k additional elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) times and must have at least 2 elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], rem is 0, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i] and preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i] and pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with k additional elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) times and must have at least 3 elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1), maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i], and preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i], and pres[i] + rem * s[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
