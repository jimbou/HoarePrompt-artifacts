Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is False, foundb is False, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, rem is k, maxs is 0, maxb is 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, stdin contains no input. If a[pb - 1] equals a[ps - 1] equals maxa, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the element at index pb-1 in list a is equal to maxa, 'Bodya' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If the last element of list a is equal to maxa, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
