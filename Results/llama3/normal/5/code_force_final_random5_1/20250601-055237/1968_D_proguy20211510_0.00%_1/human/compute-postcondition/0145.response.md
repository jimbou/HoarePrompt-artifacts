Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is 1, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is False. If `foundb` is True, then `b` is a list of integers with an additional element `maxa` if both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with three additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` and `maxa` if `foundb` is True and `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with two additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with two additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. `s` is a list of integers with two additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with two additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `b` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` is a list of integers with two additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with two additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`. `preb` is a list of integers, `pres` is a list of integers, `sb` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `ptsb` is a list of integers, `ptss` is a list of integers, `rem` is `k`, `maxs` is an integer, `maxb` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `foundb` is True if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `foundb` is False, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `s` now has an additional element `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
