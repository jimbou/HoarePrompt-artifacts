Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) on the first line, a list of n integers (p_1, ..., p_n) on the second line, and a list of n integers (a_1, ..., a_n) on the third line. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. p_i and a_i are positive integers for all i. YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 10^9 + 7, and alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxa = max(a)
    if a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        print('Bodya')
        continue
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Sasha')
        continue
    b, s = [], []
    founds, foundb = False, False
    for i in range(k):
        if foundb and founds:
            b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            break
        if foundb:
            b.append(maxa)
        elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
            foundb = True
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
        else:
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
        if founds:
            s.append(maxa)
        elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
            founds = True
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
        else:
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
    preb, pres = [], []
    sb, ss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        preb.append(sb + b[i])
        sb += b[i]
        pres.append(ss + s[i])
        ss += s[i]
    ptsb, ptss = [], []
    for i in range(len(pres)):
        rem = k - (i + 1)
        ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
        ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])
    maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)
    if maxs > maxb:
        print('Sasha')
    elif maxs < maxb:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `maxa` retain their initial values, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `True`, `b` is a list containing the elements `(k - (k)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (k - 1)) * maxa`, ..., `(k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing the elements `(k - (k)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (k - 1)) * maxa`, ..., `(k - (k - (k - 1))) * maxa`, `preb` is a list containing `sb + b[i]`, `sb + b[i] + b[i]`, ..., `sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing `len(pres)` elements `ss + s[i]`, `ss + s[i] + s[i]`, ..., `ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i]`, `ptsb` is a list containing `len(pres)` elements `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list containing `len(pres)` elements `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, 'Sasha' is printed. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, 'Bodya' is printed. If `maxs` is equal to `maxb`, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with `k` additional elements, `s` is a list of integers with `k` additional elements, `preb` is a list containing `sb` + `b[i]` repeated `len(s)` times, `pres` is a list containing `ss` + `s[i]` repeated `len(s)` times, `sb` is `sb` + `len(s)` * `b[i]`, `ss` is `ss` + `len(s)` * `s[i]`, `rem` is 0, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[i]` + `rem` * `b[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(pres)`), `ptss` is a list containing `pres[i]` + `rem` * `s[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(pres)`). If the maximum value in `ptss` is higher than the maximum value in `ptsb`, 'Sasha' is printed. If the maximum value in `ptss` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `ptsb`, 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, if the maximum value in `ptss` is larger than or equal to the maximum value in `ptsb`, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to 0, `pb` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input if `founds` is True or `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is equal to the value at index `pb - 1` in list `p` if `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `ps` is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `ps` is equal to the value at index `ps - 1` in list `p`, `p` is a list of integers from the second line of the input, `a` is a list of integers from the third line of the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `s` + (the number of iterations - 1), `foundb` is True, `b` is a list of integers with `k + 1` elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with `k + 1` elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with `k + 1` elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list of integers with `k + 1` elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with `k` elements: `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, otherwise `s` is a list of integers with `k + 1` elements: `a[ps - 1]`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[ps - 1]`, `preb` is a list of integers with (the number of iterations) elements: `sb + b[i]`, `sb + b[i] + b[i]`, ..., `sb + b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i]`, `pres` is a list of integers with (the number of iterations + 1) elements: `ss + s[i]`, `ss + s[i] + s[i]`, ..., `ss + s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i]` and must have at least (the number of iterations) elements, `sb` is an integer equal to `b[i] + b[i] + ... + b[i]`, `ss` is an integer equal to `s[i] + s[i] + ... + s[i]`, `rem` is an integer equal to `k - (i + 1)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `ptss` is a list with (the number of iterations) elements: `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, ..., `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `ptsb` is a list with (the number of iterations) elements: `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, ..., `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `s` is not empty and has at least (the number of iterations + 1) more elements. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then 'Sasha' is printed. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
