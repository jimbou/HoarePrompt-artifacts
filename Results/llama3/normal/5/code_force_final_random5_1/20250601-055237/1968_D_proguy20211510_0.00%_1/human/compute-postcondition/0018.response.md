Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `_` retain their initial values. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, 'Bodya' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, 'Sasha' is printed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
