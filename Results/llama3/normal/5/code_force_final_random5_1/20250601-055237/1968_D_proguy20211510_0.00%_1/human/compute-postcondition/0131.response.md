Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is greater than 0, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is False, b is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa, s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, stdin contains no input. The current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa***
