You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

After the loop finishes executing, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of the results of the loop's execution. The results will be a series of 'Sasha', 'Bodya', or 'Draw' printed to the console, depending on the outcome of each test case. The loop will not modify any of the input variables, so the state of the input will remain unchanged.

Return Postconditions: The loop will execute until there are no more test cases in the input. After the loop finishes executing, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of the results of the loop's execution. The results will be a series of 'Sasha', 'Bodya', or 'Draw' printed to the console, depending on the outcome of each test case. The loop will not modify any of the input variables, so the state of the input will remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
