Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string 'Bodya'.

The variables and objects in the precondition describe the state of the program before the print statement is executed. However, the print statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the string 'Bodya'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is independent of the values of `n`, `k`, `maxa`, `i`, `founds`, `foundb`, `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `rem`, `maxs`, and `maxb`.

Output: **Bodya**
