The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer, k is greater than 1, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 1, founds is True if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise founds is False, b is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa if foundb is True and a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa and a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa, s is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise s is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, stdin contains no input.**
