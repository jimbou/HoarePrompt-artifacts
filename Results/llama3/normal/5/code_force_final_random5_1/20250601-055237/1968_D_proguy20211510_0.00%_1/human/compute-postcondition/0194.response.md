Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, pb is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, ps is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, p is a list of integers from the second line of the input, a is a list of integers from the third line of the input, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is equal to the length of s, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list of integers with k additional elements, s is a list of integers with k additional elements, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) times, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], rem is 0, maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i] for all i in range(len(pres)), ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i] for all i in range(len(pres)), stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the second line of the input to `p`. The third line assigns a list of integers from the third line of the input to `a`. The fourth line assigns the maximum value in list `a` to `maxa`. No other variables are affected.
