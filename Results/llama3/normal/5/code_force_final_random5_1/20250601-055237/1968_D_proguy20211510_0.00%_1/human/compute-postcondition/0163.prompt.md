Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is False, foundb is False, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, rem is k, maxs is 0, maxb is 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is greater than 0, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 0, founds is True if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise founds is False, b is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa if foundb is True and a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa and a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1] if a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa, s is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise s is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is greater than 1, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 1. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then b is a list of integers with an additional element maxa if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise b is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. s is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. Otherwise, b is a list of integers with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise s is a list of integers with two additional elements (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1]. preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is greater than 2, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, maxb is an integer, maxs is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers, preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k - 1. If foundb is True, then b is a list of integers with an additional element maxa. If foundb is False, then pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If founds is True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element maxa. If founds is False, then ps is updated to p[ps - 1]. If foundb and founds are both True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
