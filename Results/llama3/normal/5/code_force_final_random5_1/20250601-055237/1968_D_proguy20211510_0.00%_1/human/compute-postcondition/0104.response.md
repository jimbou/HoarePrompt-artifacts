Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `i` is 0, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `rem` is `k`, `maxs` is 0, `maxb` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement, without changing any variable values.
