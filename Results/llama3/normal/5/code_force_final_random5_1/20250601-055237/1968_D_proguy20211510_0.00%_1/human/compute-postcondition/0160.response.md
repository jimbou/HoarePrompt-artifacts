Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than 2, maxa is the maximum value in list a, i is 2, maxb is an integer, maxs is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is an integer, ps is updated to p[ps - 1], foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers with an additional element a[ps - 1], preb is a list of integers, pres is a list of integers, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list of integers, ptss is a list of integers, rem is k - 1. If foundb is True, then b is a list of integers with an additional element maxa. If foundb is False, then pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If foundb and founds are both True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the code has modified the value of `ps` to `p[ps - 1]` and appended `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships as specified in the precondition.
