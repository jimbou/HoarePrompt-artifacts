Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The program iterates through each test case, processing the input data and determining the winner of the game based on the scores of Bodya and Sasha.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by defining constants and initializing variables for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha.
2.  It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.
3.  The program checks if the maximum value in array `a` is present at both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
4.  If the maximum value is present only at Bodya's starting position, it prints "Bodya" and continues to the next test case. Similarly, if the maximum value is present only at Sasha's starting position, it prints "Sasha" and continues to the next test case.
5.  If neither of the above conditions is met, the program simulates the game for both Bodya and Sasha. It maintains two lists, `b` and `s`, to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha at each turn, respectively.
6.  The program iterates through each turn of the game, updating the scores of Bodya and Sasha based on their current positions and the values in array `a`. It also checks if either player has reached the maximum value in array `a` and updates their score accordingly.
7.  After simulating the game for both players, the program calculates the total score for each player by summing up their scores at each turn and adding the remaining turns multiplied by the maximum value in array `a`.
8.  Finally, the program compares the total scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner of the game.

Correctness: **True**
