According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `n`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `_`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, and `foundb` do not ensure that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `k` and `i`.

State: **`n`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `_` retain their initial values, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
