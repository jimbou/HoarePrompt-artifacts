Output State: **_t is an integer larger than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and equal to the integer value of the input, s is a binary string of size n and equal to the string value of the input, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is 1 or cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` will be the same as the last test case processed, and the standard input `stdin` will be empty, having processed all test cases. The output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body, depending on the value of `cnt1` and the presence of '11' in the binary string `s`.
