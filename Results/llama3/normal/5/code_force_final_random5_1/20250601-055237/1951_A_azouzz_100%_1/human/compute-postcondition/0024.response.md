Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases. If cnt1 is more than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is being printed. If cnt1 is more than 2 and is an odd number, 'NO' is being printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is being printed. If cnt1 is not 1 but either less than or equal to 2 or cnt1 is odd, then if the binary string s contains the substring '11', 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed.***
