Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given configuration of lamps can be reached by performing the specified operation. The program checks the following conditions:

1. If the number of '1's in the configuration is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES' because it is possible to turn on all the lamps in pairs.
2. If the number of '1's is 1, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to turn on a single lamp.
3. If the number of '1's is greater than 2 and odd, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to turn on all the lamps in pairs.
4. If the number of '1's is 2, it checks if the two '1's are adjacent. If they are, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to turn on two adjacent lamps. If they are not adjacent, it prints 'YES' because it is possible to turn on the two lamps.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
