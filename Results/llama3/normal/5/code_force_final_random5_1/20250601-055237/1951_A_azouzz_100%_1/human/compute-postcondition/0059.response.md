Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a binary string s of size n. It then checks the number of '1's in the string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if the number of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the number of '1's is 1 or greater than 2 and odd, it prints 'NO'; if the number of '1's is 2, it prints 'NO' if the string contains '11', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
