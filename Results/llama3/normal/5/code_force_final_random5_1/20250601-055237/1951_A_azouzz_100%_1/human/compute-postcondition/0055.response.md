Postcondition: ***_t is an integer larger than 2 and at least 3, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and equal to the integer value of the input, s is a binary string of size n and equal to the string value of the input, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case. If cnt1 is larger than 2, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
