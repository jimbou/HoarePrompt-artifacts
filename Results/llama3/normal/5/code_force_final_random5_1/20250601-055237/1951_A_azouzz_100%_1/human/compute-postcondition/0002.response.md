Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, as it is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The value of `s` is now a binary string of size `n`, as it is assigned the value of the second input from stdin, which is a binary string of size `n`. The value of `cnt1` is now the number of '1' in `s`, as it is assigned the count of '1' in `s`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
