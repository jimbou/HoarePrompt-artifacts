The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer larger than 1 and at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ must be increased by 1 and t must be larger than 2.
State: **_t is an integer larger than 2 and at least 3, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and equal to the integer value of the input, s is a binary string of size n and equal to the string value of the input, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
