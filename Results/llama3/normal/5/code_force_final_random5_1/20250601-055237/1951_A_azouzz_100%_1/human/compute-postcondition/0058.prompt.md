Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2:
        print('NO')
    elif cnt1 == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases. If cnt1 is more than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is being printed. If cnt1 is more than 2 and is an odd number, 'NO' is being printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is being printed. If cnt1 is not 1 but either less than or equal to 2 or cnt1 is odd, then if the binary string s contains the substring '11', 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_t is an integer larger than 1 and at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and equal to the integer value of the input, s is a binary string of size n and equal to the string value of the input, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_t is an integer larger than 2 and at least 3, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and equal to the integer value of the input, s is a binary string of size n and equal to the string value of the input, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is 1 or cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
