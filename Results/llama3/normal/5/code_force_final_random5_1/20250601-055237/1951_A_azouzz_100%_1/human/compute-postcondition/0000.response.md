Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of an integer larger than 0 from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, since one test case has been read to assign the value to `t`. Each test case still contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.
