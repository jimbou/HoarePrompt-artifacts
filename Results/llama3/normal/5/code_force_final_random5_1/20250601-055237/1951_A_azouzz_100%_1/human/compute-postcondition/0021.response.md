Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases. cnt1 is either less than or equal to 2 or cnt1 is odd, and cnt1 is not equal to 1. If the binary string s contains the substring '11', then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed.***
