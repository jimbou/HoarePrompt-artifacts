Postcondition: ***_t is an integer larger than 2 and at least 3, _ is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and equal to the integer value of the input, s is a binary string of size n and equal to the string value of the input, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is 1 or cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
