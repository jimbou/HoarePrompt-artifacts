Output State: **_t is an integer larger than 1 and at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and equal to the integer value of the input, s is a binary string of size n and equal to the string value of the input, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases.**

The code executes in the following way: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, it remains so, but its value is now equal to the integer value of the input. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`. Since `s` was previously a binary string of size `n`, it remains so, but its value is now equal to the string value of the input. The third line assigns the number of '1' in `s` to `cnt1`. Since `s` is a binary string, `cnt1` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases.
