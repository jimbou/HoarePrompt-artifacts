Output State: *_t is an integer larger than or equal to 0, _ is equal to t, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and equal to the integer value of the input, s is a binary string of size n and equal to the string value of the input, cnt1 is the number of '1' in s, stdin contains multiple test cases - 0 test cases. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is 1 or cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of t will be equal to the number of test cases executed, the value of _ will be equal to t, the value of n and s will be equal to the last test case input, the value of cnt1 will be equal to the number of '1' in the last test case input, and the output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions in the loop.
