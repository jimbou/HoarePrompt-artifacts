To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable in this context, but still part of the loop head). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer larger than 0, it already satisfies this condition. However, to make it explicit that the loop will execute at least once, we can specify that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n**
