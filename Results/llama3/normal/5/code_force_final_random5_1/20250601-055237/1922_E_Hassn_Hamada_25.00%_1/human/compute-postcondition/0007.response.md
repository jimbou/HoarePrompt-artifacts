The variables in the loop head are size and number, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables size and number. If (1 << size + 1) - 1 is less than or equal to number, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, size is 2, and number is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, size needs to be adjusted to 3, and number needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 7.

State: **The function returns an integer value 3 representing the size of the generated sequence, and the number must be greater than or equal to 7**
