The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and size, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `size` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `size` must be greater than 1.
State: **`size` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `sequence` is a list containing one element, which is 0.**
