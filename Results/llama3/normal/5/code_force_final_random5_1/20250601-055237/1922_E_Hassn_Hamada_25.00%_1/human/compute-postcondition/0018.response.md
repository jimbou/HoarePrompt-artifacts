Output State: **`size` is at least `size`, `i` is `size - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `size - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the `size` variable remains unchanged, the loop counter `i` reaches the last index of the sequence, and the `sequence` list is populated with consecutive integers from 0 to `size - 1`, inclusive.
