The code `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` increments the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` list by `result`. Since `i` is 1, the index is `-result - 2`. The value of `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, but its value is not specified. However, we know that `size` is greater than 1, so `1 << size` is at least 2.

Output State: **`size` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, where the element at index `-result - 2` is incremented by `result`, `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.**
