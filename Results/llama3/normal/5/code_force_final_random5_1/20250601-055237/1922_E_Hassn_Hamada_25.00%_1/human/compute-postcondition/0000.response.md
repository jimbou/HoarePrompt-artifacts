Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, but the actual sequence generation code is missing, so the sequence remains unchanged. The number is still a positive integer.**

In natural language, this means that the function is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number, but since the actual code for generating the sequence is missing, the sequence remains the same as it was before. The function returns an integer value, but we don't know what this value is because the code is incomplete. The input number is still a positive integer.
