You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers.
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is a positive integer and represents the size of the generated sequence, but the actual sequence remains unchanged.
    #State: The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, but the actual sequence generation code is missing, so the sequence remains unchanged. The number is a positive integer and is not equal to 0.
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1).
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: `size` is at least `size`, `i` is `size - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `size - 1`.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: `size` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `size - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, where each element at index `-result - j - 1` is incremented by `result` for `j` in range(`size`), `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`
    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is greater than or equal to 0 and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, which is a function that takes two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, a list containing `size` elements, where each element at index `-result - j - 1` is incremented by `result` for `j` in range(`size`).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0, which is a positive integer and represents the size of the generated sequence, but the actual sequence remains unchanged.

Case_2: The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is greater than or equal to 0 and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, which is a function that takes two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, a list containing `size` elements, where each element at index `-result - j - 1` is incremented by `result` for `j` in range(`size`).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
