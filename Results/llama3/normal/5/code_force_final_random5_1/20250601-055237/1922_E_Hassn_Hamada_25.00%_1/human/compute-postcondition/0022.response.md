The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `size` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `size` must be greater than 1.
State: **`size` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, where the element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result`, `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
