The code `sequence.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of the list `sequence`. Since `i` is 0, the list `sequence` now contains one element, which is 0. The value of `size` is not affected by this code, so it remains at least 1. The value of `i` is also not changed by this code, so it remains 0.

Output State: **`size` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `sequence` is a list containing one element, which is 0.**
