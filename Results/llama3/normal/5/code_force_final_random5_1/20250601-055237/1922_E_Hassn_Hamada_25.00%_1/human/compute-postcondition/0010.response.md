Output State: **`size` is either 1, 2, or 3, `number` is greater than or equal to 7**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3, since it was initially less than 3. The value of `number` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code, and it is still greater than or equal to 7.
