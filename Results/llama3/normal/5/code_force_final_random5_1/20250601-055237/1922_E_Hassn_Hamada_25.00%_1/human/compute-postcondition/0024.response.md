To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for i in range(size):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size`.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `size` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, where the element at index `-result - 2` is incremented by `result`
- `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`.

Since `i` is 1 and `size` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1 (because of the nature of the `range` function in Python, which generates numbers up to but not including the stop value), and `size` remains greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `size` is greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2)
- `i` is 2

The states of `sequence` and `result` are not directly affected by the loop head, so they are not adjusted based on the loop head alone. However, their values might change within the loop body, but that's not considered in this step.

State: **`size` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
