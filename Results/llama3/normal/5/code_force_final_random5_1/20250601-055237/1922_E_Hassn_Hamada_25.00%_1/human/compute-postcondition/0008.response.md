Output State: **The function returns an integer value 4 representing the size of the generated sequence, and the number must be greater than or equal to 7.**

In this output state, the value of the size variable has been incremented by 1, so it now represents the size of the generated sequence as 4. The condition that the number must be greater than or equal to 7 is still valid, as the incremented size value still meets this condition.
