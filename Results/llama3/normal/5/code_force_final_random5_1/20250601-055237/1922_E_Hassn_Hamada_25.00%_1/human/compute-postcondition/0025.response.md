Output State: **`size` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sequence[-result - 3]` is increased by `result`**

In this output state, the value of `sequence[-result - 3]` is increased by `result`. The values of `size` and `i` remain unchanged. Note that the index `-result - 3` is used to access an element in the `sequence` list, and the value at this index is incremented by `result`.
