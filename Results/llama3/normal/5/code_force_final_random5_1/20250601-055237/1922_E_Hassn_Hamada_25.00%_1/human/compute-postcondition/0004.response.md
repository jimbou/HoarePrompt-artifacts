Output State: **The function returns an integer value 1 representing the size of the generated sequence, but the actual sequence generation code is missing, so the sequence remains unchanged. The number is a positive integer and is not equal to 0.**

In this output state, the variable `size` has been assigned the value 1, which represents the size of the generated sequence. However, since the actual sequence generation code is missing, the sequence itself remains unchanged. The number is still a positive integer and is not equal to 0, as specified in the initial state.
