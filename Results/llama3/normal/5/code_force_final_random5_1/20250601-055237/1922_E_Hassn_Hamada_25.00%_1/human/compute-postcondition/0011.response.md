Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1).**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the function will return the size of the generated sequence, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of the number plus 1. This is because the loop continues to increment the size as long as the condition (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number is true, which is equivalent to size + 1 <= log2(number + 1). Therefore, the final value of size will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1).
