Output State: **`size` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `sequence` is a list containing three elements, which are 0, 1, and 2.**

In this output state, the value of `size` remains the same, as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 2. However, the `sequence` list has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. Therefore, the `sequence` list now contains three elements: 0, 1, and 2.
