According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. If `size` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `size` is at least `size`, `i` is `size - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `size - 1`, `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. For the loop to be executed, `size` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`size` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `size - 1`, `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
