Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0 without modifying the sequence. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of size equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1), appends this sequence to the input sequence, and then modifies the input sequence by incrementing certain elements based on the result of a recursive function call. The function returns the sum of the sequence size and the result of the recursive function call.
