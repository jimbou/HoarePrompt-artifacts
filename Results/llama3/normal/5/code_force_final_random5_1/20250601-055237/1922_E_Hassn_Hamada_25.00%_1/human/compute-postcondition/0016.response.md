To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(size):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `size` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `sequence` is a list containing two elements, which are 0 and 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `i` is now 2, `size` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `sequence` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`size` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `sequence` is a list containing two elements, which are 0 and 1.**
