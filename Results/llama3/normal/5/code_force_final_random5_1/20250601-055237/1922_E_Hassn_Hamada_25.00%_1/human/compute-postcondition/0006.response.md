Output State: **The function returns an integer value 2 representing the size of the generated sequence, and the number must be greater than or equal to 3.**

The code increments the value of `size` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that the function returns an integer value 1 representing the size of the generated sequence, the new value of `size` is 2. The condition that the number must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid, but it is not met by the current value of `size`.
