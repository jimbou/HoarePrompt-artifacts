    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns:

        #The program returns 0, which is a positive integer and represents the size of the generated sequence, but the actual sequence remains unchanged.

    #State: `size` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `size - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, where each element at index `-result - j - 1` is incremented by `result` for `j` in range(`size`), `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`
    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is greater than or equal to 0 and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, which is a function that takes two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, a list containing `size` elements, where each element at index `-result - j - 1` is incremented by `result` for `j` in range(`size`).

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0 without modifying the sequence. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of size equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1), appends this sequence to the input sequence, and then modifies the input sequence by incrementing certain elements based on the result of a recursive function call. The function returns the sum of the sequence size and the result of the recursive function call.
