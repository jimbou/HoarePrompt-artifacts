Output State: **`size` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, where the element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result`, `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**

In this output state, the value of `size` remains greater than 0, and `i` remains 0. The `sequence` list still contains `size` elements, but the element at index `-result - i - 1` has been incremented by the value of `result`. The value of `result` is still the return value of the function `func_1` called with arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`.
