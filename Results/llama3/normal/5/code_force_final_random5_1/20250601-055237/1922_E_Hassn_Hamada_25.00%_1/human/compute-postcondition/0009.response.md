The variables in the loop head are size and number, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables size and number. If (1 << size + 1) - 1 is less than or equal to number, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, size is 4 and number is greater than or equal to 7. size being 4 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to size is less than 3. number being greater than or equal to 7 does ensure that the loop will execute again, so it does not need to be adjusted.
State: **size is less than 3, number is greater than or equal to 7**
