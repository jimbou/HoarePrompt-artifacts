According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. If `size` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1). So for the loop to be executed, the size must be at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`size` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
