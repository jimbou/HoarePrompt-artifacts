Output State: **The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is greater than or equal to 0 and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, which is a function that takes two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, a list containing `size` elements, where each element at index `-result - j - 1` is incremented by `result` for `j` in range(`size`).**
