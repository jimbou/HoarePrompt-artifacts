To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This condition involves the variables `size` and `number`.

Given that the function returns an integer value 1 representing the size of the generated sequence, we can infer that `size` is currently 1. The number is a positive integer and is not equal to 0.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` must be true. Let's evaluate this condition with the current values:

* `size` is 1
* `number` is a positive integer (but we don't know its exact value)

Substituting `size` = 1 into the condition, we get:

`(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 <= number`
`(1 << 2) - 1 <= number`
`3 <= number`

To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to adjust the state of `number` to guarantee that it is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **The function returns an integer value 1 representing the size of the generated sequence, and the number must be greater than or equal to 3.**
