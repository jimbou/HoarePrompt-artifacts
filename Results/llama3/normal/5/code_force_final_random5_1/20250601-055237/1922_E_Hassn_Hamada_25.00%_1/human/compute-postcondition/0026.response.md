Output State: **`size` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `size - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, where each element at index `-result - j - 1` is incremented by `result` for `j` in range(`size`), `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `size` remains unchanged, the value of `i` is reset to `size - 1`, and the `sequence` list has been modified such that each element at index `-result - j - 1` has been incremented by `result` for all `j` in the range of `size`. The value of `result` remains the same as the initial state, which is returned by the function `func_1` with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`.
