Output State: **`size` is at least `size`, `i` is `size - 1`, `sequence` is a list containing `size` elements, which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `size - 1`, `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.

In this output state, the values of `size`, `i`, and `sequence` remain unchanged. The new variable `result` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The exact value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
