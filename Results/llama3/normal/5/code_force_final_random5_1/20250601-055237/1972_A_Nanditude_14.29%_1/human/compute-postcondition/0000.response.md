Output State: **The program returns a list of lists of integers, where the first element of the list is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and the rest of the list consists of pairs of lists of integers, where the first element of each pair is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second and third elements of each pair are lists of n integers, sorted in non-decreasing order, sorted in descending order based on the first element of each pair.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the input list `arr` sorted in descending order based on the first element of each pair, while maintaining the internal order of the lists within each pair.
