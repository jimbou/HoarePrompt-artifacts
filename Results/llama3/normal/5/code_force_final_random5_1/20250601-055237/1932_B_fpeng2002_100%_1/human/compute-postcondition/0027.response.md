The only variables in the loop head are variables  x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and the length of the list nums. If x is less than the length of nums, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 0, nums has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, x must be 1 and nums must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is equal to the first element of `nums`, `x` is 1, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases**
