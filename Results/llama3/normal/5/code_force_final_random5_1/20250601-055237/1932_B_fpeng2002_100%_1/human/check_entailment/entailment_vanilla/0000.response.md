Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program takes the number of test cases as input, followed by the number of signs and their periodicities for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and their periodicities (a_i).
3. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the next sign is expected to occur.
4. The program then iterates through each sign's periodicity. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by dividing the current `start_year` by the sign's periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity. This effectively calculates the next multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`.
5. The program updates the `start_year` variable with the calculated next occurrence year.
6. After iterating through all signs, the program prints the final `start_year` value, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The use of integer division and multiplication ensures that the calculations are performed correctly, even when dealing with large numbers.

Correctness: **True**
