Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of signs and their periodicities, and calculates the year in which the nth sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The key part of the program is the loop that calculates the start year:

```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```

This loop correctly calculates the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous sign's periodicity. This is done by dividing the current start year by the current sign's periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the current sign's periodicity.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the number of signs is 1, in which case the start year is simply the periodicity of the first sign.

Overall, the program is well-structured, easy to understand, and accurately implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
