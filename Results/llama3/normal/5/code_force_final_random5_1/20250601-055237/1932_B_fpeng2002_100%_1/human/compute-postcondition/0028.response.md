Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`, `x` is 1, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of tests is still greater than 0 and is two less than its original value. The value of n remains the same, an integer between 1 and 100. The list of numbers also remains the same, with n integers between 1 and 10^6, and it must have at least 2 elements. The start year is now equal to the smallest multiple of the second number in the list that is greater than or equal to the first number in the list. The value of x is still 1. The standard input contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases.
