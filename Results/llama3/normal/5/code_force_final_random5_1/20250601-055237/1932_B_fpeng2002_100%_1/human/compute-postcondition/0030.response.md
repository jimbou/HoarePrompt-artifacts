Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 3 elements, `start_year` is equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`, `x` is 2, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases**

The value of `start_year` is updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`. This is calculated by dividing `start_year` by `nums[2]`, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by `nums[2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
