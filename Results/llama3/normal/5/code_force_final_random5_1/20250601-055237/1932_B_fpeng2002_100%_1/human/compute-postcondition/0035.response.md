Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the smallest multiple of the last integer that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second-to-last integer that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the first integer that is greater than or equal to the first element of the list. The function then prints this calculated value, which represents the "start year", for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is exhausted.**
