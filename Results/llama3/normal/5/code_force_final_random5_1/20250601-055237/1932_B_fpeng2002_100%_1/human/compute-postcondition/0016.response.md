The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and the length of nums. If x is less than the length of nums, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 0, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6. For the loop to execute again x is increased by 1 so x is 1 and for the loop to execute again the length of nums must be greater than 1.
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]`, `x` is 1, stdin contains `num_tests - 2` test cases, and the value of `start_year` which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]` is being printed**
