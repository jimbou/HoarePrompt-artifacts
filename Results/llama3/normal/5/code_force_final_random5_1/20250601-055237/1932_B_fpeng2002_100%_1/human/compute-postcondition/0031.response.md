Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[n-2]` that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`, `x` is n-1, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `num_tests` remains two less than its original value, `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100, and `nums` remains a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6. The value of `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element of `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second-to-last element of `nums` that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second element of `nums` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`. The value of `x` is `n-1`, and `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases.
