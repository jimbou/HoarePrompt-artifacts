Output State: **num_tests is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, start_year is equal to the smallest multiple of nums[n-1] that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of nums[n-2] that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of nums[1] that is greater than or equal to the first element of nums, x is n-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the start year is printed which is the smallest multiple of nums[n-1] that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of nums[n-2] that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of nums[1] that is greater than or equal to the first element of nums.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the number of tests (`num_tests`) will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The value of `n` and `nums` will remain the same as in the last iteration, representing the number of integers and the list of integers in the last test case, respectively. The `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last integer in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second last integer in `nums` that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the first integer in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`. The value of `x` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has finished processing all integers in the last test case. The standard input (`stdin`) will contain 0 test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed. Finally, the `start_year` will be printed, which is the smallest multiple of the last integer in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second last integer in `nums` that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the first integer in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`.
