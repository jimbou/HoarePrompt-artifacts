The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[n-2]` that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `start_year` value.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of nums[n-1] that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of nums[n-2] that is greater than or equal to ... that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of nums[1] that is greater than or equal to the first element of nums)**
