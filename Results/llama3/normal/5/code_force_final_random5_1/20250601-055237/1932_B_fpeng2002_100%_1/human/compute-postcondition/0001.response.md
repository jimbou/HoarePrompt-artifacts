To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head, which is `num_tests > 0`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).

The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`. For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Since `num_tests` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 1000, it inherently satisfies the condition of being greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time, as the given state already ensures that `num_tests` is greater than 0.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
