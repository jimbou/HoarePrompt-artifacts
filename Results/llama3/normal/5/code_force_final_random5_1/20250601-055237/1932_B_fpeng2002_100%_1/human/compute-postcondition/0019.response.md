Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[2]` and is at least `nums[2]` and is one more than the largest multiple of `nums[2]` that is less than or equal to its original value, `x` is 2, stdin contains `num_tests - 2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be one more than the largest multiple of `nums[2]` that is less than or equal to its original value. This is because the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the original value of `start_year`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
