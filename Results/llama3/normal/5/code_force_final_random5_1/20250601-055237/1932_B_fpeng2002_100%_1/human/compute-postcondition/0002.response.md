Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999, n is an integer between 1 and 100, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases.**

The first line decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1, reducing its range from 1-1000 to 0-999. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 1 and 100. The third line assigns a list of `n` integers to `nums`, where each integer is between 1 and 10^6. The fourth line initializes `start_year` to 0. Stdin now contains `num_tests - 1` test cases, as one test case has been processed.
