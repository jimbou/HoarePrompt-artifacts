To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`.

The objects in the loop head are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 2. The length of `nums` remains the same, but since `x` is now 2, `nums` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `stdin`, are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 3 elements, `start_year` is equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the first element of `nums`, `x` is 2, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 3 test cases**
