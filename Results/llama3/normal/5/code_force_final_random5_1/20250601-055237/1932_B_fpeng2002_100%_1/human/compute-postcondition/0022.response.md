Output: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]`, `x` is `n-1`, stdin contains `num_tests - 2` test cases, and the value of `start_year` which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]` is being printed, and the value of `start_year` is printed**
