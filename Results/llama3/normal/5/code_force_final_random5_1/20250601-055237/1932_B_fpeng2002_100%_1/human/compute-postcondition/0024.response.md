Output State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, n is an integer between 1 and 100, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, start_year is 0, x is n-1, stdin contains num_tests - 3 test cases.**

The code first decrements `num_tests` by 1, making it two less than its original value. Then, it reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 1 and 100. The next line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, separated by spaces, and assigns it to `nums`, which is now a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6. The last line sets `start_year` to 0, overriding its previous value. The value of `x` is not modified by the code, so it remains `n-1`. The stdin now contains `num_tests - 3` test cases, as two inputs have been read.
