Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]`, `x` is `n-1`, stdin contains `num_tests - 2` test cases, and the value of `start_year` which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The number of tests is one less than its original value, the list of numbers remains unchanged, the start year is a multiple of the last number in the list and is at least as large as that number, the loop counter is at the last index of the list, and the standard input contains the remaining test cases. The value of the start year, which is a multiple of the last number in the list and is at least as large as that number, is being printed.
