The code `num_tests = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The integer t is assigned to `num_tests`, so `num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
