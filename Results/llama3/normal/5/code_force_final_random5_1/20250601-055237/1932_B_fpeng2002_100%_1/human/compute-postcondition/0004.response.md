Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[0]` and is at least `nums[0]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be a multiple of `nums[0]` and is at least `nums[0]`. This is because the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
