Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `num_tests` and `stdin` remain unchanged, `n` and `nums` also remain unchanged but with the added condition that `nums` must have at least `n` integers, `start_year` is a multiple of the last integer in `nums` and is at least as large as that integer, and `x` is one less than `n`.
