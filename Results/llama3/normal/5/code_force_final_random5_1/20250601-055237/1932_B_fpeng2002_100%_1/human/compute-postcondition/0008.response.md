Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 3 integers, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` and is at least `nums[1]` and is equal to `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**

The code updates the value of `start_year` by dividing it by `nums[x]` (which is `nums[2]` since `x` is 2), rounding down to the nearest whole number, adding 1, and then multiplying the result by `nums[2]`. This ensures that `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[2]` and is at least `nums[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
