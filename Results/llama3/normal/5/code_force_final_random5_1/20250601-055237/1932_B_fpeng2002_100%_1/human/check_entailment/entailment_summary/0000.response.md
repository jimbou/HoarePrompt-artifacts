Reasoning:

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
3. The program initializes the start year to 0 and then iterates over the signs. For each sign, it calculates the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to the current start year. This is done using the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
4. The program prints the calculated start year for each test case, which represents the year when the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program's logic aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
