The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `num_tests` is greater than 0.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is `n-1`, and the value of `start_year` which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]` is being printed**
