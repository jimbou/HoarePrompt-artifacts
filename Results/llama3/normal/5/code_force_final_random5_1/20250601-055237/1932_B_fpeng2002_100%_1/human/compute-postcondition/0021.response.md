The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` and is at least `nums[n-1]`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `nums[n-1]` is the last element of the list `nums`. Therefore, `start_year` is a multiple of the last element of the list `nums` and is at least the last element of the list `nums`.

Output: **start_year (which is a multiple of the last element of the list nums and is at least the last element of the list nums)**
