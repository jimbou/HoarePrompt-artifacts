The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `nums`. If `x` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `len(nums)` is `n`. For the loop to execute again `x` must be 2.
State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[2]` and is at least `nums[2]`, `x` is 2, stdin contains `num_tests - 2` test cases, and the value of `start_year` which is a multiple of `nums[2]` and is at least `nums[2]` is being printed.**
