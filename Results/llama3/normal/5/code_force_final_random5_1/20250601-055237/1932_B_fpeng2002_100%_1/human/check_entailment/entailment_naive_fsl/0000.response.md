Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign to be the next multiple of the sign's periodicity after the previous sign's start year. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the signs have different periodicities
* When the signs have the same periodicity
* When the signs have periodicities that are multiples of each other
* When the number of signs is 1

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input list is empty or when the periodicities are very large.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
