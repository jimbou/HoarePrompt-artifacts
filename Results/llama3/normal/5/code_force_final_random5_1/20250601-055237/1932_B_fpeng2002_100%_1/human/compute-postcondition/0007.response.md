To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The objects involved are `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` has at least 2 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 2. The length of `nums` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 3 integers, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` and is at least `nums[1]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**
