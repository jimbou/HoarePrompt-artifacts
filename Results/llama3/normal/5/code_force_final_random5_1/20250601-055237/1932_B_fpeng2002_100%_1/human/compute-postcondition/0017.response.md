Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` and is at least `nums[1]`, `x` is 1, stdin contains `num_tests - 2` test cases, and the value of `start_year` which is a multiple of `nums[1]` and is at least `nums[1]` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `start_year` is now a multiple of `nums[1]` and is at least `nums[1]`, and it is being printed. The stdin still contains `num_tests - 2` test cases.
