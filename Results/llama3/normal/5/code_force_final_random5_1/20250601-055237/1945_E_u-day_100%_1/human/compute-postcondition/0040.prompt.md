You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and pos is the index of k in arr.
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1. If the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, then pos is n-1. Otherwise, pos remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the values that were once mid, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high + 1, 0 (where high is the high index of the search range and 0 is the value of pos + 1)
    #State: low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the values that were once mid, i is n-1, and pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed, and low + 1 and pos + 1 are printed, where low is equal to high and pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the values that were once mid, i is n-1, and the current value of pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. The current value of arr[low] is equal to k, and 0 is being printed

Case_2: low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the values that were once mid, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, and the value of arr[low] is not equal to k, and the number 1 is being printed, and this is printed: low + 1 and pos + 1, where low is equal to high and pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
