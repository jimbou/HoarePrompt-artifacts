The variables in the loop head are low and high, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables low and high. If low + 1 is less than high, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, low is either 0 or (low + high) // 2, and high is equal to mid which is (low + high) // 2. For the loop to execute again, low must be less than high - 1. So, low must be less than mid - 1, and high must be greater than mid. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing the values mid and mid, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, low is less than mid - 1, and high is greater than mid**
