Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is n, st is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calculates the midpoint of the range [low, high] and assigns it to the variable mid. Since low is 0 and high is n, the value of mid is (0 + n) // 2, which simplifies to n // 2. The second line adds the value of mid to the set st. Since st was initially empty, it now contains the single value n // 2. The values of n, k, arr, i, low, high, and pos remain unchanged.
