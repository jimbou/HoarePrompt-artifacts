The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 2. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 1. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
