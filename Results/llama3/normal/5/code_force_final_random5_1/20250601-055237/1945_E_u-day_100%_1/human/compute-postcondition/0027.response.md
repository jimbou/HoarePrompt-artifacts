Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing the values mid and mid, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, low is less than mid - 1, and high is equal to mid, mid is the average of low and high**

In this output state, the value of high has been updated to be equal to mid, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between mid, low, and high has been updated, with high now being equal to mid, and low still being less than mid - 1.
