Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `low` is equal to `high`, which means that the search range has been narrowed down to a single element.
* `st` is a set containing all the values that were once `mid`, but this is not relevant to the print statement.
* `i` is equal to `n-1`, which means that we are currently considering the last element of the array `arr`.
* `pos` is either `n-1` or `-1` depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, we know that `arr[i]` is not equal to `k` either (because `i` is equal to `n-1` and `low` is equal to `high`). Therefore, `pos` is `-1`.
* The value `1` is being printed, but this is not relevant to the print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(low + 1, pos + 1)`

* `low + 1` is equal to `high + 1`, since `low` is equal to `high`. This is the index of the next element after the last element of the array `arr`.
* `pos + 1` is equal to `-1 + 1`, which is `0`. This is because `pos` is `-1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the index of the next element after the last element of the array `arr`, and the value `0`.

Output: **high + 1, 0 (where high is the high index of the search range and 0 is the value of pos + 1)**
