Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `st` is a set containing the values `mid` and `mid`, `pos` is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to k, `low` is `mid`, and `high` is greater than or equal to `mid + 1`, `mid` is `mid`**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of the previous `low` and `high` values. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `st` still contains the values `mid` and `mid`, which are now equal to the new value of `low`. The value of `high` is still greater than or equal to `mid + 1`, and the other variables retain their previous values.
