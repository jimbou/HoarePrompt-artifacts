According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low + 1` is less than `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is either 0 or `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is either `(low + high) // 2` or `n`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the values of `low` and `high` so that `low + 1` is still less than `high`.

Since `low` is either 0 or `(low + high) // 2`, we can adjust `high` to be greater than `(low + high) // 2` to ensure `low + 1` is less than `high`. Specifically, we can adjust `high` to be greater than or equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `st` is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2, `pos` is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `low` is either 0 or (low + high) // 2, and `high` is greater than or equal to (low + high) // 2 + 1**
