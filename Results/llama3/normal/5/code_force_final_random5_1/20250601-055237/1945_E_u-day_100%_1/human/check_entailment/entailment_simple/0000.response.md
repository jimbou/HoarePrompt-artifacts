Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` using `func_1()`, which returns a map object containing a list of integers.
2. The program correctly reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`, which returns a list of values of any type returned by the iterator `func_1()`.
3. The program correctly finds the index `pos` of the value `k` in the permutation `arr`.
4. The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the value `k` in the permutation `arr`. The binary search algorithm is correct because it maintains the invariant that the value `k` is within the range `[low, high]`.
5. The program correctly handles the case where the value `k` is found at the index `low` by printing `0`.
6. The program correctly handles the case where the value `k` is not found at the index `low` by printing `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the indices that need to be swapped to make the permutation sorted.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
