Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `st` is a set containing the values `low + high` // 2 and `mid`, `pos` is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `low` is either 0 or `(low + high)` // 2, and `high` is now equal to `mid` which is `(low + high)` // 2, `mid` is `(low + high)` // 2**

In this output state, the value of `high` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `low` and `high`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `high` is now equal to `(low + high)` // 2, which means it has been updated to be the midpoint of the original range.
