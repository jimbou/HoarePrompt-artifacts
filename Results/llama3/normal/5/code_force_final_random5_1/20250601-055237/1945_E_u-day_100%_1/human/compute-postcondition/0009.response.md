Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 2, `pos` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `pos` is no longer dependent on the condition `arr[i] == k`, but is now simply equal to the value of `i`, which is 2.
