Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `low` is (low + high) // 2, `high` is n, `st` is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2, `pos` is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, and the value of arr[mid] is less than or equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `low` has been updated to be the middle index of the current range, which is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and the value of `arr[mid]` is still less than or equal to `k`. The position `pos` is still either `n-1` or `-1` depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.
