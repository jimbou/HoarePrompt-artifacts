Postcondition: **low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the values that were once mid, i is n-1, and pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed, and low + 1 and pos + 1 are printed, where low is equal to high and pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k.**
