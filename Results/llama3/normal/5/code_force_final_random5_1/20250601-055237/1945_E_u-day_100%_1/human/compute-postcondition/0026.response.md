Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing the values mid and mid, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, low is less than mid - 1, and high is greater than mid, mid is the average of low and high**

The code calculates the average of `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. It then adds `mid` to the set `st`. Since `mid` is already in `st`, adding it again does not change the set. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.
