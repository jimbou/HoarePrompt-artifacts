Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and pos is -1.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers and `k` is between 1 and `n`, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the returned values from `func_1()`. The second line calls the function `func_2()` and assigns its return value to `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, so the value of `arr` is updated to the returned list from `func_2()`. The third line assigns the value `-1` to `pos`. Since the initial state specifies that `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, the value of `pos` is updated to `-1`, indicating that `k` is no longer at a valid index in `arr`.

Note that the code does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, or `arr` based on their previous values. Instead, it updates their values to the returned values from the functions `func_1()` and `func_2()`. The value of `pos` is simply set to `-1` without any relation to its previous value.
