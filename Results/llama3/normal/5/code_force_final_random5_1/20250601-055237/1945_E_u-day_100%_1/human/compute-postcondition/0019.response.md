Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. If the current value of arr[mid] is greater than k, then low is 0 and high is (low + high) // 2. Otherwise, low is (low + high) // 2 and high is n.***
