Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1. If the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, then pos is n-1. Otherwise, pos remains -1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index of the array `arr`. If the value at this index is equal to `k`, then the position `pos` will be updated to `n-1`. Otherwise, `pos` will remain `-1`, indicating that `k` was not found in the array. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
