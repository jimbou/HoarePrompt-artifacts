The code `pos = i` assigns the value of `i` to `pos`. Since `i` is 1, `pos` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 1, and `pos` is 1.**
