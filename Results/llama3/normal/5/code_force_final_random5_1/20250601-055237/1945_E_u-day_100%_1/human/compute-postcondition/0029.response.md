Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing the values mid and mid, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. If arr[mid] is greater than k, then low is less than mid - 1 and high is equal to mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid and high is greater than mid. In both cases, mid is the average of low and high.***
