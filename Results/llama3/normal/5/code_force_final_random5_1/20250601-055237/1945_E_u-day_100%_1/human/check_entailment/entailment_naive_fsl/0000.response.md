Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem description. The binary search algorithm should continue until `r - l == 1`, but the program stops when `low + 1 < high`, which is not the same condition. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

For example, consider the input `n = 5, x = 3, p = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`. The program will output `2` and swap the elements at positions `2` and `4`, but the correct output should be `1` and swap the elements at positions `1` and `3`. This is because the binary search algorithm should continue until `r - l == 1`, which would lead to the correct swap.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
