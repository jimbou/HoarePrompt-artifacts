Output State: **low is equal to high, st is a set containing all the values that were once mid, i is n-1, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the search space defined by low and high has been narrowed down to a single value, which is stored in both low and high. The set st contains all the mid values that were calculated during the loop's execution. The value of i remains n-1, and pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k.
