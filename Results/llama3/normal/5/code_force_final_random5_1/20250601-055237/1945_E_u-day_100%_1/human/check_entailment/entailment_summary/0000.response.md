Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a target value k in a permutation of distinct integers using a modified binary search algorithm. The program consists of multiple functions, but the main logic is implemented in func_3.

func_3 first reads the input values n and k, and the permutation array arr. It then finds the position of the target value k in the array. The function then performs a binary search on the array, maintaining a set st of indices that have been visited.

If the target value k is found at the index low, the function prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. If k is not found, the function prints 1 and the indices low + 1 and pos + 1, indicating that a single swap is needed to move the target value to the correct position.

The program's logic is correct, and it meets the problem description. The use of a set to keep track of visited indices is unnecessary, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
