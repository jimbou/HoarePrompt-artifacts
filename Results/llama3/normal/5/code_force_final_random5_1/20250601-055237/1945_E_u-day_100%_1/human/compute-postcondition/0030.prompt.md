Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is n, st is an empty set, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k.
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. If the current value of arr[mid] is greater than k, then low is 0 and high is (low + high) // 2. Otherwise, low is (low + high) // 2 and high is n.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing the values mid and mid, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. If arr[mid] > k, then low is either 0 or (low + high) // 2, and high is now equal to mid which is (low + high) // 2. If arr[mid] <= k, then low is mid, and high is greater than or equal to mid + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing the values mid and mid, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. If arr[mid] is greater than k, then low is less than mid - 1 and high is equal to mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid and high is greater than mid. In both cases, mid is the average of low and high.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
