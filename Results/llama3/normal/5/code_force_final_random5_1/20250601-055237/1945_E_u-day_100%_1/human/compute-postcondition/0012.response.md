Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is n, st is an empty set, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code introduced two new variables, `low` and `high`, which were assigned the values 0 and `n`, respectively. Additionally, an empty set `st` was created. The value of `pos` remains dependent on the condition specified in the initial state, which is not affected by the code.
