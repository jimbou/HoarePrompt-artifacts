Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not sorted, and the program is allowed to perform at most 2 operations (swapping elements) before running the binary search algorithm.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` reads input from the user and returns a map of integers. `func_2` converts the map to a list. `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem.

In `func_3`, the program first reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `k`. It then reads the permutation `arr` and finds the position `pos` of `k` in the array.

The program then performs a binary search on the array, but with a twist. Instead of updating the `low` and `high` variables based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`, it updates them based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`. This is because the array is not sorted, and the program is trying to find the position where `k` should be if the array were sorted.

The program uses a set `st` to keep track of the indices that have been visited during the binary search. However, this set is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be removed.

After the binary search, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no operations are needed. Otherwise, the program prints 1, indicating that one operation is needed, and prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the positions where the swap operation should be performed.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program assumes that the binary search will always find the correct position where `k` should be if the array were sorted. But this is not always the case, especially when the array is not sorted. The program should instead find the correct position of `k` in the sorted array and then perform the swap operations accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
