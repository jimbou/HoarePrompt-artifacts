Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `st` is a set containing the values mid and mid, `pos` is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, `low` is equal to mid, `high` is greater than mid, `mid` is the average of low and high**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains distinct integers from 1 to n, and the set `st` still contains the values mid and mid. The position `pos` is still either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. The value of `high` is still greater than `mid`, and `mid` is still the average of `low` and `high`.
