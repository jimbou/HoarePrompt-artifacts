To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `low + 1 < high`. This condition depends on the values of `low` and `high`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n`.
- `st` is an empty set.
- `pos` is either `n-1` or `-1` depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.

The condition `low + 1 < high` will be true if `low` is less than `high - 1`. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The other variables' states do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, `i` is `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set, `pos` is either `n-1` or `-1` depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.**
