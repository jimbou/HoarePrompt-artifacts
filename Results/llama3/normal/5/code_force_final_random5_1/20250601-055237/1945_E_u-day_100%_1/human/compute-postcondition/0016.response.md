Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is (low + high) // 2, st is a set containing the value (low + high) // 2, pos is either n-1 or -1 depending on whether the current value of arr[i] is equal to k. The current value of arr[mid] is greater than k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `high` has been updated to be the middle index of the current range `[low, high]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and the current value of `arr[mid]` is still greater than `k`. The value of `pos` is still either `n-1` or `-1`, depending on whether the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.
