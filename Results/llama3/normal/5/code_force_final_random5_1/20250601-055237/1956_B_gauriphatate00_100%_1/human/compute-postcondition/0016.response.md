Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` elements, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value equal to the count of `num` in `a`, `max_score` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `max_score` that has been initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
