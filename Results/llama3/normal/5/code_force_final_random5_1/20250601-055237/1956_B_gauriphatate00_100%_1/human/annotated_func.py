    #State: `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` elements, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value equal to the count of `num` in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and its count in `a` is 2, then `max_score` is equal to the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear twice in `a`. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 0.
    return max_score
    #The program returns max_score which is equal to the number of integers from 1 to n that appear twice in list a, or 0 if no integer appears twice.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by counting the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the input list a. It returns the count of such integers, or 0 if no integer appears twice.
