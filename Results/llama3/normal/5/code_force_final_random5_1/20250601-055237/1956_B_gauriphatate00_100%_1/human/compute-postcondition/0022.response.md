Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` elements, `n` is a positive integer and is at least 1, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value equal to the count of `num` in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and its count in `a` is 2, then `max_score` is 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 0.***
