Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num in count_a:
        count_a[num] += 1
    else:
        count_a[num] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `num` and the value is the count of `num` in `a` plus one if `num` is already in `count_a`, otherwise `count_a` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and 1 as its value, and `num` is the first element in the list `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value of 1 if `num` is not already in `count_a`, otherwise the value is the count of `num` in `a` plus one if `num` is already in `count_a` and the count is 1, otherwise the value is the count of `num` in `a` plus two if `num` is already in `count_a` and the count is larger than 1, and `num` is the second element in the list `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value of 1 if `num` is not already in `count_a`, otherwise the value is the count of `num` in `a` plus one if `num` is already in `count_a` and the count is 1, otherwise the value is the count of `num` in `a` plus two if `num` is already in `count_a` and the count is larger than 1, and `num` is the third element in the list `a`. If `num` is already in `count_a`, the value of `num` in `count_a` is increased by one if the count is 1, otherwise it is increased by two. If `num` is not in `count_a`, the value of `num` in `count_a` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
