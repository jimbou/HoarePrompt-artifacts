The only variables in the loop head are variables  num and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and `n`. If `num` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `num` must be increased by 1 so `num` is `n + 2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n + 1`. However, `n` cannot be greater than `n + 1` so the loop cannot execute again. However, we are asked to adjust the state so that the loop can execute again. So we will adjust the state so that the loop can execute again.
State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` elements, `n` is a positive integer and is at least 3, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value equal to the count of `num` in `a`, `num` is `n + 2`. If `num` is in `count_a`, then `max_score` is 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 0.**
