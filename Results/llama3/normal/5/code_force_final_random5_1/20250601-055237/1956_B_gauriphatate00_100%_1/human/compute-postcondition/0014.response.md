Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value of 1 if `num` is not already in `count_a`, otherwise the value is the count of `num` in `a` plus one if `num` is already in `count_a` and the count is 1, otherwise the value is the count of `num` in `a` plus two if `num` is already in `count_a` and the count is larger than 1, and `num` is the third element in the list `a`. If `num` is already in `count_a`, the value of `num` in `count_a` is increased by one if the count is 1, otherwise it is increased by two. If `num` is not in `count_a`, the value of `num` in `count_a` is set to 1.**
