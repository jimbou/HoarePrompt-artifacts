Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `num` and the value is the count of `num` in `a` plus one if `num` is already in `count_a`, otherwise `count_a` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and 1 as its value, and `num` is the first element in the list `a`***
