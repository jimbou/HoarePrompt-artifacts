Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each number in the input list `a` and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` to find the numbers that appear twice in the list. For each such number, it increments the `max_score` by 1, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When there are no numbers that appear twice in the list, the `max_score` remains 0.
* When there are numbers that appear twice in the list, the `max_score` is incremented correctly.
* When the input list `a` contains numbers outside the range from 1 to `n`, the program ignores them correctly.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1 or when the input list `a` is empty.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally.
