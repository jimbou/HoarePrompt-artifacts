To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` elements, `n` is a positive integer and is at least 1, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value equal to the count of `num` in `a`, `max_score` is 0, `num` is 1**
