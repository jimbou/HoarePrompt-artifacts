To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `num` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer, we can conclude that `a` must have at least 1 element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to ensure it has at least 1 element. We can also adjust the state of `num` to be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
