Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by counting the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the input list `a`. This is because if a number appears twice in the list, it means that the player has two cards with the same number, and they can play one of them to get a point. 

The function correctly initializes a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each number in the list `a`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if each number appears twice in the list. If a number appears twice, it increments the `max_score` by 1. 

Finally, the function returns the `max_score`, which is the maximum number of points that can be achieved.

Correctness: **True**
