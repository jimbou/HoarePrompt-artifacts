Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` elements, `n` is a positive integer and is at least 3, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value equal to the count of `num` in `a`, `num` is `n + 2`, `max_score` is 2 if `num` is in `count_a`, otherwise `max_score` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `max_score` has been updated to be 2 if `num` is in `count_a`, otherwise it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
