Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` elements, `n` is a positive integer and is at least 1, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the key `num` has a value equal to the count of `num` in `a`, `max_score` is 1, the current value of `num` is 1, and `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a`. The current count of `num` in `a` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n` with each integer appearing at most twice, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The dictionary `count_a` keeps track of the count of each number in `a`. The maximum score has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The current number `num` is 1, and it is a key in the dictionary `count_a` with a count of 2.
