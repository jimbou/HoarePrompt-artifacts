Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, num is a positive integer, numbers is 0, out is a list containing the sum of the integer values of the strings at even indices of list1, a is a positive integer, list1 is a sorted list of strings, list2 is a list containing the integer value of the string at index 0 of list1, the integer value of the string at index 2 of list1, the integer value of the string at index 4 of list1, and so on, up to the integer value of the string at index 2*(a-1) of list1, i is a-1**

In this output state, the value of `out` has been updated to include the sum of the integer values of the strings at even indices of `list1`, which is stored in `list2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
