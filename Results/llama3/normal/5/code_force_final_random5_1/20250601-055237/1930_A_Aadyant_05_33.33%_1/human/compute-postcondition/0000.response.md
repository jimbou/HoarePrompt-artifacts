Output State: **stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), num is a string equal to the first line of stdin, out is an empty list.**

Explanation: The first line of code reads the first line of stdin and assigns it to the variable `num`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) followed by `t` test cases, `num` will be a string representation of the integer `t`. The second line initializes an empty list `out`. The rest of the code does not modify any variables or stdin. Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of `num` and `out`, as well as the remaining contents of stdin, which are the `t` test cases.
