Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.

2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program creates a set of unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order. This is done using the `sorted(set(encoded))` expression, which correctly implements the first step of the decoding algorithm.

4. The program then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character to its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters. This is done using the `char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` expression, which correctly implements the second step of the decoding algorithm.

5. Finally, the program uses the `char_map` dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string. This is done using the `''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))` expression, which correctly implements the third step of the decoding algorithm.

6. The decoded string is then returned by the `func_1` function and printed as the output for each test case.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order
* Strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters (although the problem statement specifies that the input strings will only contain lowercase letters)

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
