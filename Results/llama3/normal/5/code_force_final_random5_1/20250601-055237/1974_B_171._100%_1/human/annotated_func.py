#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with `len_unique` key-value pairs where each key is a character in `unique_chars` and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored index in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`, `i` is `len_unique - 1`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string 'decoded' where each character is the mirrored character of the corresponding character in 'encoded', 'decoded' is created by mapping each character in 'encoded' to its corresponding character at the mirrored index in the sorted list of unique characters 'unique_chars'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a new string where each character is replaced by its mirrored character in the sorted list of unique characters from the input string. The mirroring is done by mapping each character to the character at the opposite index in the sorted list of unique characters.
