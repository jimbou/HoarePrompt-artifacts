Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with `len_unique` key-value pairs where each key is a character in `unique_chars` and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored index in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`, `i` is `len_unique - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `char_map` dictionary will have a key-value pair for each unique character in the `encoded` string, where each key is a unique character and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored index in the `unique_chars` list. The `i` variable will have reached its final value, which is `len_unique - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `encoded` and `unique_chars` variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
