Reasoning:

1. The problem requires decoding a given string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.

2. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string.

3. Inside `func_1`, it first finds all unique characters in `b` using `set(b)` and sorts them in alphabetical order using `sorted`. This gives the auxiliary string `r`.

4. It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is done by iterating over the indices of `r` and mapping each character to the character at the corresponding index from the end of `r`.

5. Finally, it uses a generator expression to replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character from `r` using the `char_map` dictionary. The resulting decoded string is returned.

6. The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

7. The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
