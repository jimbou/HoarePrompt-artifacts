To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len_unique):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `len_unique`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `len_unique`. If `i` is less than `len_unique`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `len_unique` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `len_unique` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `len_unique` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `encoded`, `unique_chars`, `char_map`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the character at index 1 in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 2` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
