Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters in encoded, sorted in ascending order, char_map is an empty dictionary, len_unique is the number of unique characters in encoded
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len_unique):
    char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the character at index 1 in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 2` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 1, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the character at index 1 in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 2` in `unique_chars`, and the key is the character at index 2 in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 2, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
