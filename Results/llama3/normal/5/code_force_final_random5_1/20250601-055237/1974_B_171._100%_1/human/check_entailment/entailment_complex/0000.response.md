Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The program correctly implements the decoding process by first finding the unique characters in the encoded string, sorting them in ascending order, and then creating a dictionary that maps each character to its mirrored character in the sorted list of unique characters.

The program then uses this dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding mirrored character, effectively decoding the string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
