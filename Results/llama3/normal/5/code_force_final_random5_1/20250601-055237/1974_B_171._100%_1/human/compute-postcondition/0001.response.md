According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len_unique`. If `len_unique` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`, so it needs to be adjusted to `len_unique` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
