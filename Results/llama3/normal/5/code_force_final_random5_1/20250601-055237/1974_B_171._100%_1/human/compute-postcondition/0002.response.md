Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the dictionary `char_map` has been updated with a new key-value pair. The key is the character at index `i` in the sorted list of unique characters `unique_chars`, and the value is the character at the mirrored index `len_unique - 1 - i` in the same list. The other variables remain unchanged.
