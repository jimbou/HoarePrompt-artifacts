Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an encoded string as input, creates a sorted list of unique characters from the string, and then maps each character in the string to its mirrored character in the sorted list. This is done by creating a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character to its mirrored character, and then using this dictionary to replace each character in the string with its mirrored character. The resulting decoded string is then returned.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases, the length of each string, and the string itself from the input, and then prints the decoded string for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
