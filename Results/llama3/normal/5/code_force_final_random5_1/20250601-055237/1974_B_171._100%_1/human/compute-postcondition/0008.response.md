Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with `len_unique` key-value pairs where each key is a character in `unique_chars` and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored index in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`, `i` is `len_unique - 1`, `decoded` is a string where each character is the mirrored character of the corresponding character in `encoded`**.

In this output state, the new variable `decoded` is introduced, which is a string where each character is the mirrored character of the corresponding character in `encoded`. The mirroring is done based on the `char_map` dictionary, which maps each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character at the mirrored index. The other variables remain unchanged.
