Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The program correctly implements the decoding process by first finding the unique characters in the encoded string, sorting them in ascending order, and then creating a dictionary that maps each character to its mirrored character. Finally, it uses this dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly reverses the encoding process to obtain the original string. The use of a dictionary to map characters to their mirrored characters is an efficient approach, and the program's implementation is clear and concise.

Correctness: **True**
