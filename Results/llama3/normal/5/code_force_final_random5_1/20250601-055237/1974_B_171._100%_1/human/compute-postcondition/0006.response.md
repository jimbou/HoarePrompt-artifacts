Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the character at index 1 in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 2` in `unique_chars`, and the key is the character at index 2 in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `char_map` has been updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is the character at index 2 in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1` in `unique_chars`. The other variables remain unchanged.
