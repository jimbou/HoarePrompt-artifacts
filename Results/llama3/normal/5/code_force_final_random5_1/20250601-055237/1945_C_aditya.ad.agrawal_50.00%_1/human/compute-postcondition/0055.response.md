Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the second element in arr is 0, then z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus two, o_r is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 2, and o_l is 0. If the second element in arr is not 0, then z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus one, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus one, z_l is 1, and o_l is 1. If o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is equal to pos, otherwise ans is 0, where b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus pos.***
