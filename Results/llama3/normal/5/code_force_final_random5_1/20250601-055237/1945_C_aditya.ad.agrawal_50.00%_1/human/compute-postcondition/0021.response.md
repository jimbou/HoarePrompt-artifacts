Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr minus 1, z_l is 1, o_l is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the next element in the list, b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 minus 1 or 30001, ans is either 0 or 1, pos is either 1 or 2**

The code increments `o_l` by 1 and decrements `o_r` by 1. Since `o_l` was initially 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, and `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr` if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in `arr` minus 1, the new values of `o_l` and `o_r` are 1 and the number of ones in `arr` minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise they are 2 and the number of ones in `arr` minus 2. No other variables are affected.
