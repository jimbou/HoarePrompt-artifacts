Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus n.**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from stdin, a string `input_string` of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, and converts the string into a list of integers `arr`. It then counts the number of zeros `z` and ones `o` in `arr`, and initializes variables `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` based on the values of `z`, `o`, and `n`. The values of `t`, `b_d`, and the remaining test cases in stdin are not affected by the code.
