Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus three if the first two elements in arr are 0, otherwise it remains the same minus two if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it remains the same, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus three, z_l is 2 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, o_l is 1 if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 2, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), i is the third element in arr which is either 0 or not 0, ans is 1, b_d is the absolute value of n/2.**

The code modifies the values of `o_l` and `o_r`. The first line increments `o_l` by 1, and the second line decrements `o_r` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
