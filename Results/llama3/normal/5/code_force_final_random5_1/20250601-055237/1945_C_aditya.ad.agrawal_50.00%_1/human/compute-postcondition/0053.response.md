Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus two if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus one, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of ones in arr minus one, z_l is 2 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise z_l is 1, o_l is 0 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise o_l is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is equal to pos, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus pos, otherwise ans is 0, pos is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is the second element in arr.**

In this output state, the values of `z_r`, `z_l` have been updated based on the initial values of `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, and the second element in `arr`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
