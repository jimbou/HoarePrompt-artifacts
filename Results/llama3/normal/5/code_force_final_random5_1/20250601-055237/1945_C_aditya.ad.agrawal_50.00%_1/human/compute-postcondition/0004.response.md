Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, b_d is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `b_d` which is assigned the value of `dist`, which is the absolute value of `n/2`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
