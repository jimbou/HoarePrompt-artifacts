The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is accepted and assigned to `t`. The second input, a string `a` of length `n`, is still in stdin. The value of `t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
