Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `pos` is equal to `n`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of ones in `arr`, and `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2` minus `n`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and (`b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`), then `ans` is equal to `pos`, otherwise `ans` is either equal to 0 or the value of `pos` when the loop terminated, and the value of `ans` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and the number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by one. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
