Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if i is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr minus 1 if i is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 2 if i is not 0, otherwise it is 3, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0 and i is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the third element in the list, if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is either 1 or 2, and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 minus 1 or the absolute value of n/2 minus 2, and pos is increased by 1.**

The code increments `z_l` by 1 and decrements `z_r` by 1. This means that the number of zeros on the left side (`z_l`) increases by 1, and the number of zeros on the right side (`z_r`) decreases by 1. The values of `z` and `o` remain unchanged, as they represent the total number of zeros and ones in the list, respectively. The values of `o_r` and `o_l` also remain unchanged, as they depend on the first element of the list and the value of `i`, which are not modified by the code. The value of `dist` remains the same, as it is calculated based on the absolute value of `n/2`, which is not changed by the code. The value of `i` remains the same, as it is the third element in the list, which is not modified by the code. The conditions for `ans` and `b_d` remain the same, as they depend on the values of `o_r`, `z_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, and `pos`, which are not all modified by the code.
