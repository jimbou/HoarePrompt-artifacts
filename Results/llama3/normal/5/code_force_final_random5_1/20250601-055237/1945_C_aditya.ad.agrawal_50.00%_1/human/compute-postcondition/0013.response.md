Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus 1, z_l is 1, o_l is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the first element in the list and is not equal to 0, b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 or 30001 depending on the value of o_r.**

In this output state, the values of `o_l` and `o_r` have been updated. `o_l` is now 1, and `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr` minus 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
