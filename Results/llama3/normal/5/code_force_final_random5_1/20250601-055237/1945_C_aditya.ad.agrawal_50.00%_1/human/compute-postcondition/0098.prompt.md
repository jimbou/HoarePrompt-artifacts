Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive). If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the total elements in `arr`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of zeros in `arr` minus one if the first element in `arr` is 0, otherwise it remains the same, `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr` minus one if the first element in `arr` is not 0, otherwise it remains the same, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0 if the first element in `arr` is 0, otherwise it is 1, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 1 if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is met, otherwise it is 0, `pos` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), `i` is the first element in `arr` which is either 0 or not 0, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2` minus 1 if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is met, otherwise it remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus three if the first two elements in arr are 0, otherwise it remains the same minus two if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it remains the same, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus two if the first two elements in arr are not 0, otherwise it remains the same minus one if the first element in arr is not 0, otherwise it remains the same, z_l is 2 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), i is the second element in arr which is either 0 or not 0. If o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is 3 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 3. Otherwise, ans remains 1 and b_d remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus three if the first two elements in arr are 0, otherwise it remains the same minus two if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it remains the same, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus two if the first two elements in arr are not 0, otherwise it remains the same minus one if the first element in arr is not 0, otherwise it remains the same, z_l is 3 if the second element in arr is 0 and the third element is 0, otherwise it is 2 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1 if the first element in arr is not 0 and the third element is 0, otherwise it is 2, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), i is the third element in arr which is either 0 or not 0. If i is 0, ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2. If i is not 0, ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus three, and z_l is 2 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, o_l is 1 if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 2. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, and z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute difference between n/2 and pos, then ans is 4 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 4, otherwise ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
