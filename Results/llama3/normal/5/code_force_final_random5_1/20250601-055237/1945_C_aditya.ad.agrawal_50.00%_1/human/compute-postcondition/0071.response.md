Output State: **`n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, `pos`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `b_d` is updated to be equal to `dist`, which is the absolute value of `n/2`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by three.
