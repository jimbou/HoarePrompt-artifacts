Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr minus 1, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr minus 1, z_l is 2, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the next element in the list, b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 minus 1 or 30001, ans is either 0 or 1, pos is either 1 or 2**

The code increments `z_l` by 1 and decrements `z_r` by 1. Since `z_l` was initially 1, it becomes 2. The value of `z_r` depends on whether the first element in `arr` is 0 or not. If it is 0, `z_r` was initially the number of zeros in `arr` minus 1, so it becomes the number of zeros in `arr` minus 2. If the first element is not 0, `z_r` was initially the number of zeros in `arr`, so it becomes the number of zeros in `arr` minus 1. No other variables are affected.
