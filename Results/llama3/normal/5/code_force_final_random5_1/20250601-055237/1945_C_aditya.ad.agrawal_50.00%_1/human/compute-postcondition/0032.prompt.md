Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, then b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, b_d is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr minus 1, z_l is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the current value of i is either 0 or not equal to 0, which is the first element in the list. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, then the current value of b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 1. Otherwise, the current value of b_d is 30001. Additionally, if o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, the current value of z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and the current value of b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 minus pos, then ans is 1 and pos is 1. Otherwise, ans is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if i is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr minus 1 if i is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 1 if i is not 0, otherwise it is 2, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0 and i is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the next element in the list, if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is either 1 or 2, and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 minus 1 or the absolute value of n/2 minus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if i is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr minus 1 if i is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 1 if i is not 0, otherwise it is 2, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0 and i is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the third element in the list. If o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is either 1 or 2, and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 minus 1 or the absolute value of n/2 minus 2, and pos is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is pos, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus pos, and pos is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
