Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2.**

In this output state, the value of b_d has been updated to be equal to dist, which is the absolute value of n/2. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, and the values of t, n, input_string, arr, z, o, z_r, o_r, z_l, o_l, dist, ans, and pos are still the same as in the initial state.
