Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr minus 1, z_l is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the current value of i is either 0 or not equal to 0, which is the first element in the list. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, then the current value of b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, the current value of b_d is 30001.***
