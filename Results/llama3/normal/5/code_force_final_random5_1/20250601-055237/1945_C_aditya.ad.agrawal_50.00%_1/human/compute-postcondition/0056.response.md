Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 3, ans is 3, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the second element in arr is 0, then z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus two, o_r is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 2, and o_l is 0. If the second element in arr is not 0, then z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus one, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus one, z_l is 1, and o_l is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `pos` to `ans` and calculates the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, storing it in `b_d`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `pos`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is set to 3, which is the value of `pos`. The value of `b_d` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n/2` and 3.
