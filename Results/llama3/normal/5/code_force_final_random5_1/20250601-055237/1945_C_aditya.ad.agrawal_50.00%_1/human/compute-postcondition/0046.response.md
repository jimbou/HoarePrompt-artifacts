Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus one, z_l is 1, o_l is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, i is the first element in arr and i is not equal to 0**

The code increments `o_l` by 1 and decrements `o_r` by 1. Since `o_l` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The value of `o_r` is reduced by 1, but its exact value depends on the initial count of ones in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
