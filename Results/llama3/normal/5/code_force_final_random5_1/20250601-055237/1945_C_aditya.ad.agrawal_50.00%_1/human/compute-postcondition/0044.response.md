Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus one, o_r is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 1, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, i is 0, and the first element in arr is 0.**

In this final state, the values of `z_r` and `z_l` have been updated. `z_r` has decreased by one, and `z_l` has increased by one. The other variables remain unchanged.
