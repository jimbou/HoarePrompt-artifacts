To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element. Since `arr` is a list of integers, we can adjust its state to reflect this requirement.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2` if `o_r` >= (`z_r` + `o_r`) / 2, otherwise `b_d` is 30001, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
