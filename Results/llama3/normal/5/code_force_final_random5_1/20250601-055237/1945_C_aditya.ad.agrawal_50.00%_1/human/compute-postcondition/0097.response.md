Postcondition: ***n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus three if the first two elements in arr are 0, otherwise it remains the same minus two if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it remains the same, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus two if the first two elements in arr are not 0, otherwise it remains the same minus one if the first element in arr is not 0, otherwise it remains the same, z_l is 3 if the second element in arr is 0 and the third element is 0, otherwise it is 2 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1 if the first element in arr is not 0 and the third element is 0, otherwise it is 2, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), i is the third element in arr which is either 0 or not 0. If i is 0, ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2. If i is not 0, ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus three, and z_l is 2 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, o_l is 1 if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 2. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, and z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute difference between n/2 and pos, then ans is 4 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 4, otherwise ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2.***
