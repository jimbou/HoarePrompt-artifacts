Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus one if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of ones in arr minus one, z_l is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise o_l is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, and i is the first element in arr. The current value of o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, the current value of z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and the current value of b_d is greater than the absolute difference between n/2 and pos.**
