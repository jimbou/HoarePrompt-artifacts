Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), `i` is the first element in `arr` and is not equal to 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the total elements in `arr`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.***
