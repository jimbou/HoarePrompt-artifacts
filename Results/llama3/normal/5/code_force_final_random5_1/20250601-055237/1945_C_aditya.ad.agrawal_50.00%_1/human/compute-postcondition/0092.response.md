Output State: **`n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of zeros in `arr` minus three if the first two elements in `arr` are 0, otherwise it remains the same minus two if the first element in `arr` is 0, otherwise it remains the same, `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr` minus two if the first two elements in `arr` are not 0, otherwise it remains the same minus one if the first element in `arr` is not 0, otherwise it remains the same, `z_l` is 2 if the second element in `arr` is 0, otherwise it is 1, `o_l` is 0 if the first element in `arr` is 0, otherwise it is 1, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `pos` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), `i` is the third element in `arr` which is either 0 or not 0. If `o_r` >= (`z_r` + `o_r`) / 2 and `z_l` >= (`z_l` + `o_l`) / 2 and (`b_d` > abs(`n` / 2 - `pos`)), then `ans` is 3 and `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2` minus 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1 and `b_d` remains the same.**

The code increments the value of `pos` by 1, so `pos` is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
