Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least one element, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus one, z_l is 1, o_l is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), i is the first element in arr and is not equal to 0, b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 or 30001 depending on whether o_r is greater than or equal to half of the total elements in arr.**

The code increments `o_l` by 1 and decrements `o_r` by 1. No other variables are affected.
