Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is 0, o_r is 0, z_l is the number of zeros in arr, o_l is the number of ones in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, and the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met which is ans is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 2 and 3*10^5 (inclusive). The values of the other variables remain the same. The number of test cases in stdin has also been decremented by 1.
