Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr minus 1 if i is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in arr, o_r is the number of ones in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr minus 1 if i is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 1 if i is not 0, otherwise it is 2, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0 and i is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the third element in the list, ans is pos, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus pos, pos is increased by 1.**
