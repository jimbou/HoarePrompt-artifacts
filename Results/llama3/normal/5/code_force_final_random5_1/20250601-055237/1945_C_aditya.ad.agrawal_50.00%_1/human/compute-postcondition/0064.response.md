Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the third element of arr, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 4. If o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - 4)), then ans is 4. Otherwise, ans is either equal to 0 or 4 (depending on the conditions).***
