Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus three if the first two elements in arr are 0, otherwise it remains the same minus two if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it remains the same, o_r is the number of ones in arr minus two if the first two elements in arr are not 0, otherwise it remains the same minus one if the first element in arr is not 0, otherwise it remains the same, z_l is 2 if the second element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in arr is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 3, pos is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), i is the second element in arr which is either 0 or not 0, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 3.**

The code assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 3. The second line assigns the absolute value of `n/2 - pos` to `b_d`, making `b_d` equal to the absolute value of `n/2 - 3`. No other variables are affected.
