Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least one element, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus one, o_r is the number of ones in arr, z_l is 1, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), i is the first element in arr which is 0. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the total elements in arr, then b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, b_d is 30001.**

The code increments `z_l` by 1 and decrements `z_r` by 1. Since `i` is 0, `z_l` becomes 1 and `z_r` becomes the number of zeros in `arr` minus one. No other variables are affected.
