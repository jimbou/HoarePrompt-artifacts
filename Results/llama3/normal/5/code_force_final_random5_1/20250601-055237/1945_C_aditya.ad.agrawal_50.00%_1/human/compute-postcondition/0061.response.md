Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the third element of arr, z_r is the number of zeros in arr minus two or one (depending on the second element of arr), o_r is the number of ones in arr minus one or zero (depending on the second element of arr) minus one, z_l is 2 or 1 (depending on the second element of arr), o_l is 0 or 1 (depending on the second element of arr) plus one, ans is either equal to pos or 0 (depending on the conditions), and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus pos.**

The code increments `o_l` by 1 and decrements `o_r` by 1. The values of `o_l` and `o_r` depend on the second element of `arr`. If the second element is 0, `o_l` becomes 1 and `o_r` becomes the number of ones in `arr` minus two. If the second element is 1, `o_l` becomes 2 and `o_r` becomes the number of ones in `arr` minus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
