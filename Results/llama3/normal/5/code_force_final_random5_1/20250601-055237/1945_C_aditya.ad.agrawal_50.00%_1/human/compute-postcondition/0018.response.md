To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head `for i in arr:`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes on the value of the next element in the list `arr`. Since we are not given any information about the specific elements in `arr`, we can only adjust the state of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, which is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute again, `i` should take on the value of the next element in the list. Since we don't know the specific value of the next element, we can only say that `i` is the next element in the list.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `stdin`, `b_d`, `ans`, and `pos`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of zeros in `arr` minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr` if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the next element in the list, `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` minus 1 or 30001, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `pos` is either 0 or 1**
