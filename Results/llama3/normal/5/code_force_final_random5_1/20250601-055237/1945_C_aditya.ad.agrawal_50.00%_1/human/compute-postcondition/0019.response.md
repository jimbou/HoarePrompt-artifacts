Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the number of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of zeros in `arr` minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of ones in `arr` if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of ones in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the next element in the list, `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` minus 1 or 30001, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `pos` is either 1 or 2**

The value of `pos` has been incremented by 1. The value of `pos` was either 0 or 1, so now it is either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
