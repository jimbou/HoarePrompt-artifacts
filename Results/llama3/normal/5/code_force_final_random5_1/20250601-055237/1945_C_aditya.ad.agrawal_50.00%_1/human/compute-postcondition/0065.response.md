Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers, z is the number of zeros in arr, o is the number of ones in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, pos is equal to n, z_r is 0, o_r is 0, z_l is the number of zeros in arr, o_l is the number of ones in arr, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus n. If o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is equal to pos, otherwise ans is either equal to 0 or the value of pos when the loop terminated.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The value of t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, input_string remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged, z remains unchanged, o remains unchanged, dist remains unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, pos is equal to n, z_r is 0, o_r is 0, z_l is the number of zeros in arr, o_l is the number of ones in arr, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus n. The value of ans depends on the conditions in the loop. If the conditions are met, then ans is equal to pos, otherwise ans is either equal to 0 or the value of pos when the loop terminated.
