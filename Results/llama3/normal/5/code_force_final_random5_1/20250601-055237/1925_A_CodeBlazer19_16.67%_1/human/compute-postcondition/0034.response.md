The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing the characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+97`. If `k` is 1, the string 'a' repeated `n` times is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, then if `n` is 1, an empty string is printed, otherwise, the string `s` is printed twice.**
