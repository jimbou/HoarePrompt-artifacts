State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+96`. If `k` is 1, the string 'a' repeated `n` times is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, either `s` or `2*s` is printed, depending on the value of `n`.**
