Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 96 and less than or equal to 26, `s` is a string containing a single character with ASCII value 97, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 97**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include a single character with ASCII value 97, which is the character 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-6` lines of input, each with two integers `n` and `k` within their respective ranges.
