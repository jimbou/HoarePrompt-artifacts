To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the range defined by `97` and `k + 97`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `k + 97` is greater than `97`, which means `k` must be greater than `0`. Since `k` is already defined as an integer between `1` and `26` inclusive, this condition is already satisfied.

However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be within the range defined by `97` and `k + 97`. Since `j` is currently defined as `k + 96`, we can adjust it to be `97` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 97**
