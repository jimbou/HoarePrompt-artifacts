Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+96`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The value of `k` will still be between 1 and 26 inclusive. The string `s` will contain `k` characters, starting from 'a' and ending at the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`. The variable `j` will have the value `k+96`, which is the ASCII value of the last character added to the string `s`.
