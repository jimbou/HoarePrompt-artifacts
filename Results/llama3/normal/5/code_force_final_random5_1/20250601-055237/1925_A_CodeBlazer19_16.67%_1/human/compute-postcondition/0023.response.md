The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 97`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 98, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than 1. So `j` is 99 and `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing the character 'a' and 'b', `stdin` contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 99**
