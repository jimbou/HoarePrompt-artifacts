Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, s is an empty string, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), j is k+96.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `s` is now an empty string, as assigned by the second line of the code. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, as one line of input has been consumed by the first line of the code.
