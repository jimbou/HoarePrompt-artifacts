Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing the character 'a', `stdin` contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 97**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain the character 'a' because `chr(j)` returns the character represented by the ASCII value `j`, which is 97 for 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
