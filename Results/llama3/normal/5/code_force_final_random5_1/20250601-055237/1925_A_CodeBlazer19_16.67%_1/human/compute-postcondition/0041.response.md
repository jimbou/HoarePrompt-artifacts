Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26, `s` is a string containing three characters with ASCII values 98, 98, and 99, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 99**

The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 99, the character 'c' is appended to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
