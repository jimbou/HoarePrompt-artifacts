The code prints the product of `n` and `s`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, and `s` is a string containing 1 character with ASCII value 97, which corresponds to the lowercase letter 'a', the product `n * s` will be a string consisting of `n` repetitions of the character 'a'.

Output: **a repeated n times (where n is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive)**
