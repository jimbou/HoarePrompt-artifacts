The code prints a string that is either equal to `s` or `2*s`, depending on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, the string printed is equal to `s`, otherwise, it is equal to `2*s`. Where `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive.

Output: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+96`, and either `s` or `2*s` is printed, depending on the value of `n`**
