Output: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing `k` characters with ASCII values ranging from 97 to `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+97`, and this is printed: a string that is either equal to `s` (if `n` is not equal to 1) or equal to `s` repeated twice (if `n` is equal to 1)**
