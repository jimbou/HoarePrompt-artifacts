To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 97, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 98. The value of `k` remains the same.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing the character 'a', `stdin` contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 98**
