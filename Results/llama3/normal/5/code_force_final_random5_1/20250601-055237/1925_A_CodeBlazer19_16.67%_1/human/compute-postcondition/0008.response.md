Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26, `s` is a string containing three characters 'abc', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 99**

The code appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 99) to the string `s`. Since `j` is 99, the character appended is 'c'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
