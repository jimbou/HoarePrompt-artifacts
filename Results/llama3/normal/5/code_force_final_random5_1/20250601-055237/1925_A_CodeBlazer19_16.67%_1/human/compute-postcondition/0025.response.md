Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing the characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+97`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the string `s` containing all the characters from 'a' up to the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`. This is because the loop iterates from the ASCII value of 'a' (97) up to `k+96`, adding each character to the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
