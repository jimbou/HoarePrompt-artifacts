The function reads input from stdin, expecting a specific format: the first line contains an integer t, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k. It then generates a string s consisting of k characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value k+96. Depending on the value of k, it prints either the string 'a' repeated n times (if k is 1) or either s or 2*s (if k is greater than 1), with the choice between s and 2*s depending on the value of n. After processing all input lines, stdin is left empty.
