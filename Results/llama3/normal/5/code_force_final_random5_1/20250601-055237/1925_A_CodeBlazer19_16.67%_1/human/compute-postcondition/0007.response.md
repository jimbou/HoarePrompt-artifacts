To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 98. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 99.

The value of `k` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26, `s` is a string containing two characters 'ab', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 99**
