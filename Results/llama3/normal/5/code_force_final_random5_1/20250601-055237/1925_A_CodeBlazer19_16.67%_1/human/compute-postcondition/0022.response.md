Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing the character 'a' and 'b', `stdin` contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 98**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the character 'b' in addition to 'a', as `chr(j)` evaluates to 'b' when `j` is 98. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
