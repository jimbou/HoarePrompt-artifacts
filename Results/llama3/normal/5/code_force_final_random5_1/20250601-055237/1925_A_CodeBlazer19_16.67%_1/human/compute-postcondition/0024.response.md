Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', `stdin` contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 99**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending the character 'c' (which is the character represented by the ASCII value 99) to the original string containing 'a' and 'b'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
