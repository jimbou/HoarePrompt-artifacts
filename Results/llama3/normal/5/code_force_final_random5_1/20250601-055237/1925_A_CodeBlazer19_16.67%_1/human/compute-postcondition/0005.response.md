The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `k + 97`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 97, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 98 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26, `s` is a string containing a single character 'a', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 98**
