To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `k`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is already an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we need to adjust the value of `j` to be within the range of the loop.

Since the loop starts from 97 and goes up to `k + 97`, we can set `j` to be 97, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 97**
