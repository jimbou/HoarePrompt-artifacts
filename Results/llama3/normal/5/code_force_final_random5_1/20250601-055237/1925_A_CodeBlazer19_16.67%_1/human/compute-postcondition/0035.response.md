Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, s is an empty string, stdin contains t-6 lines of input, each containing two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), j is k+97.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variable `s` is now an empty string, as assigned by the second line of the code. The stdin now contains `t-6` lines of input, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function in the first line of the code.
