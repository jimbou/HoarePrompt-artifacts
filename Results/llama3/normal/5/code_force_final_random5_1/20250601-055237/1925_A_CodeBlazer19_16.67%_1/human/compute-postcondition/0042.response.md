Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing `k` characters with ASCII values ranging from 97 to `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+97`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the string `s` will contain `k` characters, each with an ASCII value ranging from 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') to `k+96` (the ASCII value of the `k`-th character after 'a'). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The value of `j` is updated to `k+97` after the loop finishes executing.
