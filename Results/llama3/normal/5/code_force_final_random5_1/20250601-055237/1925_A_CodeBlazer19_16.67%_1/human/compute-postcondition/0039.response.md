Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 96 and less than or equal to 26, `s` is a string containing two characters with ASCII values 98 and 98, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 98**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain two characters with ASCII values 98, which is the result of concatenating the original character with ASCII value 98 and the new character with ASCII value 98 obtained from `chr(j)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
