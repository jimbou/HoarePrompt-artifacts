Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26, `s` is a string containing two characters 'ab', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 98**

The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 98, the character 'b' is appended to `s`, resulting in a string containing two characters 'ab'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
