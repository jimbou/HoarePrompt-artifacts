Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing a single character 'a', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is 97**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain a single character 'a', which is the result of `chr(j)` where `j` is 97. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` lines of input, each with two integers `n` and `k` within the specified ranges.
