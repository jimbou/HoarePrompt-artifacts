The code prints the result of multiplying the value of `n` by the string `s`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, and `s` is a string containing the character 'a', the result will be a string containing `n` repetitions of the character 'a'.

Output: **a repeated n times (where n is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive)**
