Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''
    for j in range(97, k + 97):
        s += chr(j)
    if k == 1:
        print(n * s)
    else:
        print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+96`. If `k` is 1, the string 'a' repeated `n` times is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, either `s` or `2*s` is printed, depending on the value of `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing the characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+97`. If `k` is 1, the string 'a' repeated `n` times is printed. If `k` is greater than 1, then if `n` is 1, an empty string is printed, otherwise, the string `s` is printed twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `s` is a string containing `k` characters with ASCII values ranging from 97 to `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+97`. If `k` is 1, a string containing `n` repetitions of the character with ASCII value 97 (which is 'a') is printed. If `k` is not 1, a string that is either equal to `s` (if `n` is not equal to 1) or equal to `s` repeated twice (if `n` is equal to 1) is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
