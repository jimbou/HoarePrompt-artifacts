Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, `k` is 1, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k+96`, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26), `j` is `k+96` which is 97. The current value of `k` is 1.**
