Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move. The problem statement provides examples and notes to illustrate the game's behavior.

The provided Python program reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, determines whether the sum of each pair is even or odd, and prints 'Bob' for even sums and 'Alice' for odd sums. The program processes a specified number of pairs, as indicated by an initial integer input, and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem statement.

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the pairs of integers and storing them in variables `a` and `b`.
2. The program checks whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the modulo operator (`(a + b) % 2 == 0`). This is a correct approach, as the parity of the sum determines the winner of the game.
3. The program prints the correct output based on the parity of the sum. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. This matches the problem statement's examples and notes.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program's logic. The problem statement mentions that the game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means that the game's state is not solely determined by the sum of the coins in the wallets. The program's logic assumes that the game's outcome is solely determined by the parity of the sum, which is not entirely accurate.

In the problem statement's examples, the game's outcome is indeed determined by the parity of the sum, but this is not a general rule. There might be cases where the game's outcome depends on the specific sequence of moves, not just the parity of the sum.

Therefore, the program's logic is not entirely correct, and it might produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
