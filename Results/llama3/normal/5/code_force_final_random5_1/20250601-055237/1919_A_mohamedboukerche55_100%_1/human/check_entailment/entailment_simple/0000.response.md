Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

The given program uses a simple and elegant approach to solve the problem. It calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) and checks if it is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

This approach is correct because the game can be analyzed as follows:

* If the sum of the coins is even, Alice and Bob can alternate turns, exchanging wallets and removing coins, until both wallets are empty. In this case, Bob will make the last move, and Alice will not be able to make a valid move, so Bob wins.
* If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice can make the first move, exchanging wallets and removing a coin. Then, Bob will have to exchange wallets and remove a coin, and so on. In this case, Alice will make the last move, and Bob will not be able to make a valid move, so Alice wins.

The program correctly implements this logic, and the output matches the expected results for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
