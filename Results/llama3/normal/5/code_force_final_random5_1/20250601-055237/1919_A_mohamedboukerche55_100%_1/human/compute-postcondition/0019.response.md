Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers. If (a + b) is even, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are overwritten. The value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains `t-4` lines, each containing two integers. The code does not modify the condition for printing 'Bob' or 'Alice', which depends on the parity of `a + b`.
