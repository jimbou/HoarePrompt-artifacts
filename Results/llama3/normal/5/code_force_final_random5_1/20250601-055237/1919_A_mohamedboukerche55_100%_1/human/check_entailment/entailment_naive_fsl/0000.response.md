Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who makes the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The program uses the fact that if the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who removes the last coin wins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice's turn, and vice versa if the total number of coins is odd.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of Alice's and Bob's coins using the modulo operator (`(a + b) % 2 == 0`). If the result is 0, it means the total number of coins is even, and Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
