Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin is empty, i is t-1. If (a + b) is even for the last iteration, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive), the standard input (`stdin`) will be empty because all lines have been read, and the loop counter `i` will be one less than `t` (since it starts at 0 and goes up to `t-1`). The last output will depend on whether the sum of `a` and `b` from the last line read from `stdin` is even or odd, determining whether 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed, respectively.
