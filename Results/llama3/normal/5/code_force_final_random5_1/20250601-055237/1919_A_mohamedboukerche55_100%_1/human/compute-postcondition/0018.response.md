The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers. If (a + b) is even, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed.**
