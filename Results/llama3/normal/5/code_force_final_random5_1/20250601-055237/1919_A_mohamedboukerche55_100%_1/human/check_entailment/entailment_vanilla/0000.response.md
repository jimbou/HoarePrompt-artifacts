Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program uses a simple approach to determine the winner. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, `a` and `b`, respectively.

The program then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the modulo operator (`(a + b) % 2`). If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", and if the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game can be won by the player who can make the last move. Since the players alternate turns, the player who starts with the higher number of coins will always have the opportunity to make the last move, unless the total number of coins is odd.

When the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can make the first move and ensure that Bob is left with an even number of coins. When the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves and ensure that Alice is left with an even number of coins.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Correctness: **True**
