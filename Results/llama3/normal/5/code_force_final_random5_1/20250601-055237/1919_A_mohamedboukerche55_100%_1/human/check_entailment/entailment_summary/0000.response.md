Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, who take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move. The provided program determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

The program works by reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It calculates the sum of the coins and checks if it is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game can be viewed as a series of moves where each player either exchanges wallets or removes a coin. Since the players alternate turns, the total number of moves is equal to the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum is even, Bob will make the last move, and if it is odd, Alice will make the last move. Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum.

Correctness: **True**
