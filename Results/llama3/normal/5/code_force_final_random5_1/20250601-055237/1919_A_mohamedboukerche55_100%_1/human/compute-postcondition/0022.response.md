Based on the precondition, the code will print 'Alice' regardless of the values of a and b, or whether (a + b) is even or odd. The reason is that the print statement is hardcoded to print 'Alice', and there is no conditional statement that checks the parity of (a + b) to determine what to print.

Output: **Alice**
