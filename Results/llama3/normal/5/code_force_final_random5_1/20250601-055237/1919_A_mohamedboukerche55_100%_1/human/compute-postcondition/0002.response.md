The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `i` is 0**
