Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads the first input from stdin, which is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000).
	* `int()` converts this input to an integer.
	* The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Since `t` is now assigned a value, we can update the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

Note that the value of `t` is now known to be between 1 and 1000, and the stdin still contains the remaining `t` lines of input.
