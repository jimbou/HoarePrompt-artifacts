Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'Bob'.

The value of the variable 't' is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, but it does not affect the output of the print statement.

The values of the variables 'a' and 'b' are integers between 1 and 10^9, but their exact values are not specified. However, it is mentioned that their sum is even, which also does not affect the output of the print statement.

The variable 'i' is initialized to 0, but it is not used in the print statement.

The fact that stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers, is also irrelevant to the output of the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
