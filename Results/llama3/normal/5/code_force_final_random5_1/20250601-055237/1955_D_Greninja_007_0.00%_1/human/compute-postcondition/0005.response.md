Postcondition: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, k is an integer, n is an integer greater than m, m is an integer, good_subarrays is 1 if the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in the first m elements of list a and its frequency in list b is greater than or equal to k, otherwise good_subarrays is 0, b_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in list b, window_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of list a, matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in the first m elements of list a and its frequency in list b, i is 0, and the current value of a[i] is an integer that exists in the frequency counter b_freq.**
