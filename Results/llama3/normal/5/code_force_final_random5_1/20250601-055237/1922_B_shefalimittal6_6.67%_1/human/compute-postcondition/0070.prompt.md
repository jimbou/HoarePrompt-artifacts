Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the input list, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, x is the last integer in the list, res is not defined, cnt is not defined, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for x in nums:
    num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is the first integer in the list, `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, `res` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `res` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `num_of_lens[y]` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_of_lens[x]` is greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers with at least one more element, `x` is the third integer in the list, `res` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
