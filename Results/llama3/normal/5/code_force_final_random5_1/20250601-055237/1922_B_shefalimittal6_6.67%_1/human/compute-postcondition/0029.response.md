The code prints the value of `res`, which is the sum of the initial value of `res` and the number of ways to choose 2 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value, plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order for values that are 3 or more.

Since the exact values of `num_of_lens` and `res` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of the initial value of res and the number of ways to choose 2 items from each value in num_of_lens without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except the current value, plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from each value in num_of_lens without repetition and without order for values that are 3 or more)**
