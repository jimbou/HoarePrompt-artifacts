The value of `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, where `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 3. `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order. Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is a positive integer. Therefore, the value of `res` is increased by a positive integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least one value, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin is empty**
