The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` adds the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time to the value of `res`. The value of `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens`, which is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list.

Since `num_of_lens` has at least two values, `cnt` is a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items, which is a positive integer.

The value of `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time.**
