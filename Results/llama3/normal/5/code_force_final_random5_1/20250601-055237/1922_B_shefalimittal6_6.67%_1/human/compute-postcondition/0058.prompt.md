Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 0 integers.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least one value greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list. If the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3 and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of the first value in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time and `math.comb(cnt, 2)` times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the input value, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, x is the last integer in the list. If cnt is 2 or more, res is increased by the number of combinations of cnt taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, and total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements without repetition and without order if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
