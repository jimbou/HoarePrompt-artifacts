To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `nums`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If the list has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least one integer, `x` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `nums` must have at least one more integer, and `x` must be the next integer in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is 1, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers**
