Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time.***
