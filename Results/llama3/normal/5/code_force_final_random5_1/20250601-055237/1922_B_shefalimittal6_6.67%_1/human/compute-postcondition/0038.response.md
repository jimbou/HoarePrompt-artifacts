Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is 1, the second integer in the list as a key and its value is 2, and the third integer in the list as a key and its value is 1 plus the previous value of the third integer in the dictionary, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) - 1 integers.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been updated to be 1 plus its previous value, which was either 0 or a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less integer than before, since one integer was used to update the value of `num_of_lens[x]`.
