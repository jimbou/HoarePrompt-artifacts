Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in nums as keys and their respective counts as values, nums is a list of n integers, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state is such that the dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains all integers from the list `nums` as keys, with their respective counts as values. The list `nums` remains unchanged, and the other variables `t`, `_`, and `n` retain their initial values. The stdin now contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.
