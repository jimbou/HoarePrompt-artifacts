Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, such that a non-degenerate triangle can be formed out of them.

The program first counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `num_of_lens`. Then, it iterates over the counts of each stick length. If a stick length has a count of 3 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)` and adds it to the result. If a stick length has a count of 2 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of that length and 1 stick of any other length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths, and adds it to the result.

The program correctly handles the cases where the order of choosing sticks does not matter and where the sticks must form a non-degenerate triangle.

Correctness: **True**
