Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is `t`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and the value of `res` which is a positive integer greater than 0 is being printed, and `stdin` contains 0 integers.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables inside the loop have been updated accordingly. The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `x`, `cnt`, `res`, and `total_sum` have been updated based on the last iteration of the loop. The input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input data has been processed.
