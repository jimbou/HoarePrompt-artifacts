Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is a positive integer greater than 0, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least one value, nums is an empty list, x is not defined, cnt is the first value in num_of_lens and is greater than or equal to 2, res is a positive integer greater than 0 if cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is 0, total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

The code calculates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` and assigns it to `total_sum`. Then, it increments `res` by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` becomes a positive integer greater than 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. No other variables are affected.
