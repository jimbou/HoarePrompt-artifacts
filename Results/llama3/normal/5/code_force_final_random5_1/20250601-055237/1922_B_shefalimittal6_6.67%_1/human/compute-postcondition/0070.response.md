Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is a positive integer greater than 0, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, nums is an empty list, x is not defined, res is not defined, cnt is not defined, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `_` remains 2, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` remains a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` becomes an empty list because all elements have been processed, `x` is no longer defined because the loop has finished, `res` and `cnt` remain undefined as they were not affected by the loop, and `stdin` remains empty.
