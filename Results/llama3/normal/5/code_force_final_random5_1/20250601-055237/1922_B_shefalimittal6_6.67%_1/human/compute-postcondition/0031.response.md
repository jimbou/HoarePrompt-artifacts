The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is the sum of the initial value of `res` and the number of ways to choose 2 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value, plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order for values that are 3 or more, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`. `stdin` contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers, and the value of `res` is being printed**
