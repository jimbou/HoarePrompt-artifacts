Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least three values, nums is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is the third value in num_of_lens, res is the initial value of res plus the number of ways to choose 2 items from cnt items without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the product of the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order (calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 2)`) and the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` (calculated using `total_sum`). The other variables remain unchanged.
