Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is 0, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.**

In this output state, a new variable `res` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.
