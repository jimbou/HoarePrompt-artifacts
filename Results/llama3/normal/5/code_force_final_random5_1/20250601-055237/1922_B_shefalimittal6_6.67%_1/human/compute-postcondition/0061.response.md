The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time and the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value, `cnt` is not defined**
