The only variable in the loop head is variable x and list nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable nums. If nums has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - 1 integers. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is the first integer in the list.
State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - 1 integers**
