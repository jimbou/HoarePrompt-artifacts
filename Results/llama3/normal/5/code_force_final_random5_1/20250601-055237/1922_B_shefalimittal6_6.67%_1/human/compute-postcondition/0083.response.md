Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0 and its value is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.***
