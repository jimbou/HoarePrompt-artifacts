Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least one value greater than 0, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, and if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, then the current value of `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of the first value in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time and 0, otherwise the current value of `res` remains 0. Additionally, the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.***
