Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is a positive integer greater than 0, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, nums is an empty list, x is not defined, cnt is the second value in num_of_lens, res is a positive integer greater than 0 and its value is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 items from cnt items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the product of the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order (calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 2)`) and the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` (calculated using `total_sum`). The value of `total_sum` remains the same as it was not modified by the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
