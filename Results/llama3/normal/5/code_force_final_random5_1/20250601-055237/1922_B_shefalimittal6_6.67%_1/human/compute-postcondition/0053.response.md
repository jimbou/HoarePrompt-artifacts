The only variable in the loop head is variable  cnt, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. If `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_of_lens` has at least two values greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` and `num_of_lens` has at least two values greater than 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
