Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements without repetition and without order if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.***
