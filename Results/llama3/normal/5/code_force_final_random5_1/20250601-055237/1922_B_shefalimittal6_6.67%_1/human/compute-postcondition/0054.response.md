Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements without repetition and without order.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is increased by the number of combinations of 3 elements that can be chosen from `cnt` elements, where `cnt` is the next value in the dictionary `num_of_lens` that stores the frequency of each integer in the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
