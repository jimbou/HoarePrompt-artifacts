Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the input value, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, x is the last integer in the list, cnt is the next value in the iteration of num_of_lens.values(), res is increased by the number of combinations of cnt taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time and the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The value of `total_sum` has been calculated as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
