Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is the sum of the initial value of `res` and the number of ways to choose 2 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value, plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order for values that are 3 or more, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`. `stdin` contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `_`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged. `num_of_lens` still contains the count of each integer in `nums`. `res` is updated to include the number of ways to choose 2 items from each count in `num_of_lens` (without repetition and without order) times the sum of all other counts, plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from each count in `num_of_lens` (without repetition and without order) for counts that are 3 or more. `cnt` is the last count in `num_of_lens`. The contents of `stdin` remain the same.
