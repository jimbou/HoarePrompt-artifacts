To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for x in nums:`. The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If the list has at least one more integer, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `nums` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is 1, and the second integer in the list as a key and its value is 2, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers**
