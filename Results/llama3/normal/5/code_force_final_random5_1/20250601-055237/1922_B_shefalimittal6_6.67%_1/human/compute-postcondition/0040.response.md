Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 0 integers.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been changed to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `cnt` is still not defined. The stdin is empty, containing 0 integers.
