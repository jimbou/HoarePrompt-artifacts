Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains 2*t*n integers, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5. The first integer is n, and the next n integers are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    num_of_lens = {}
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for x in nums:
        num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
    res = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
        if cnt >= 2:
            total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
            res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is the sum of the initial value of `res` and the number of ways to choose 2 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value, plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order for values that are 3 or more, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`. `stdin` contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers, and the value of `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time and the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value, `cnt` is not defined, and the value of `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and the value of `res` which is a positive integer greater than 0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
