Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the next value in the iteration of `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, which is calculated using the `math.comb` function. The other variables remain unchanged.
