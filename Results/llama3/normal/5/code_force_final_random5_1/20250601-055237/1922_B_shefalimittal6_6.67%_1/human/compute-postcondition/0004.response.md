The code `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1` updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary initially, `num_of_lens.get(x, 0)` will return 0 if `x` is not already a key in the dictionary, and the value associated with `x` if it is. Therefore, `num_of_lens[x]` will be set to 1 if `x` is not already a key, and incremented by 1 if it is.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - 1 integers**
