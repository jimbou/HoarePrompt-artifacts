This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n integers. The function calculates the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 items from the input integers without repetition and without order, and prints the result for each test case. The input stream is emptied after processing all test cases.
