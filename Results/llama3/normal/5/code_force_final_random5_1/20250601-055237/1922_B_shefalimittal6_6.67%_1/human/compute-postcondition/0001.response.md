According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `t` does not need to be adjusted. However, the state of `_` needs to be adjusted to 0, because the loop variable `_` starts from 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains 2*t*n integers, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5. The first integer is n, and the next n integers are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= n.**
