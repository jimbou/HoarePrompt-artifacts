Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is 0, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is the sum of the initial value of `res` and the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains the same as its initial value. `stdin` contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` is either the updated value or remains the same as its initial value plus the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains the same as its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` is the initial value of `res` plus the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains the same as its initial value. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is either the updated value or remains the same as its initial value plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order. Otherwise, `res` remains the same as its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
