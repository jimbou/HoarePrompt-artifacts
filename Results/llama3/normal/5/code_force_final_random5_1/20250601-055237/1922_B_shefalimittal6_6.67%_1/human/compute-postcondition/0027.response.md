Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` is the initial value of `res` plus the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains the same as its initial value. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is either the updated value or remains the same as its initial value plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order. Otherwise, `res` remains the same as its initial value.***
