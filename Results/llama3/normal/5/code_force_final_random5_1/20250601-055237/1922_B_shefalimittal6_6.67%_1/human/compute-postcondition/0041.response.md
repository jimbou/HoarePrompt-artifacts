To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. The loop will execute if `num_of_lens` has at least one value (i.e., at least one integer in the list `nums` has a count greater than 0). 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least one value greater than 0, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is 0, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`**
