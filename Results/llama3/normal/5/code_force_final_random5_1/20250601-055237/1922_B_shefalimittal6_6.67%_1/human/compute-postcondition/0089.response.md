Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all variables remain unchanged except for `cnt`, `res`, and `total_sum`. The value of `cnt` will be the last value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary, `res` will be a positive integer greater than 0, and `total_sum` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
