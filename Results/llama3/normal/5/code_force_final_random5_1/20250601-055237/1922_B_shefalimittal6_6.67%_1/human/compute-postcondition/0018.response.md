To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values():`, which means the loop iterates over the values of the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `t` is a positive integer
* `_` is 0
* `n` is a positive integer
* `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one value
* `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer
* `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`
* `res` is either the sum of the initial value of `res` and the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, or remains the same as its initial value, depending on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. Since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we can only modify `cnt`.

For the loop to execute again, there must be another value in `num_of_lens` to iterate over. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

* `cnt` becomes the next value in `num_of_lens` (since we've already processed the first value)

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, and `res`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is either the updated value or remains the same as its initial value**
