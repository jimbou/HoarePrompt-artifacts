According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin, so for the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 1 integer and `x` is the first integer in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers**
