Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The value of `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, which is calculated using the math.comb function.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is increased by the number of combinations of 3 items that can be chosen from `cnt` items, which is calculated using the math.comb function. All other variables remain unchanged.
