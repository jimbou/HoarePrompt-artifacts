Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least two values, nums is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is the second value in num_of_lens, total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, and res is either the updated value or remains the same as its initial value plus the number of ways to choose 2 items from cnt items without repetition and without order, multiplied by total_sum.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `cnt` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The new variable `total_sum` is introduced, which is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The value of `res` is updated by adding the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by `total_sum`, to its initial value.
