To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for x in nums:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `nums` must have at least 2 integers, and `x` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - 1 integers**
