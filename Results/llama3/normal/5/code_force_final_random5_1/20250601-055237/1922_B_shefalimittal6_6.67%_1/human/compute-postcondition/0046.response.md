Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the input value, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least one value greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, x is the last integer in the list, cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is the sum of the number of combinations of the first value in num_of_lens taken 3 at a time and math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum, and total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet modifies the values of `res` and introduces a new variable `total_sum`. The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time and the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The value of `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
