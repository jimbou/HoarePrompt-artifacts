Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is the first integer in the list, `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, `res` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been increased by 1, indicating that the first integer `x` in the list has been counted one more time. The other variables remain unchanged.
