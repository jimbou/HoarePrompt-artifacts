Output State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, stdin is empty

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list `nums`, and the dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains the correct count of each integer in the list. The list `nums` is now empty, and the variable `x` holds the last integer that was processed in the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
