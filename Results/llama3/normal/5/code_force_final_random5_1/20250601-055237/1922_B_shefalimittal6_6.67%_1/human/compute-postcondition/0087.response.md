Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is a positive integer greater than 0, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, nums is an empty list, x is not defined, cnt is the next value in num_of_lens, res is increased by the number of combinations of cnt items taken 3 at a time if cnt is greater than or equal to 3, and also increased by the product of the number of combinations of cnt items taken 2 at a time and the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `cnt` is still the next value in `num_of_lens`, but its value is used in calculations. The value of `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and also increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
