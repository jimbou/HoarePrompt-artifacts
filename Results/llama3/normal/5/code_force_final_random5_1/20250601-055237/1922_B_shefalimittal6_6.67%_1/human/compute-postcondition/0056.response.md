Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the input value, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, x is the last integer in the list, cnt is the next value in num_of_lens.values(), res is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements without repetition and without order if cnt is greater than or equal to 3, total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements without repetition and without order, multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The value of `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
