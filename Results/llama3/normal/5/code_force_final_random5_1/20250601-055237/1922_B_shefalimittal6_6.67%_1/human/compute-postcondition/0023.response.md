To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values():`, which means we are iterating over the values of the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next value in the dictionary.

Since `num_of_lens` has at least two values, we can assume that there is a third value. Let's call this third value `cnt_new`.

Here's the updated state:

* `t` is still a positive integer (no change)
* `_` is still 0 (no change)
* `n` is still a positive integer (no change)
* `num_of_lens` is still a dictionary with at least two values (no change)
* `nums` is still a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer (no change)
* `cnt` is now the third value in `num_of_lens` (updated)
* `res` depends on the value of `cnt_new`. If `cnt_new` is 2 or more, `res` is either the updated value or remains the same as its initial value plus the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt_new` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt_new`. Otherwise, `res` remains the same as its initial value.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is either the updated value or remains the same as its initial value plus the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, depending on the value of `cnt`**
