The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1, the new value of `num_of_lens[x]` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - 1 integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - 1 integers.**
