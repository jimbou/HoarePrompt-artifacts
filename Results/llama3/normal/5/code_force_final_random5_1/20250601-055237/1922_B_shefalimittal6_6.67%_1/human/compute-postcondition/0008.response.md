Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 3, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - 2 integers.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been updated to 3, as it was initially 2 and the code increments it by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 2*t*n - n - 2 integers.
