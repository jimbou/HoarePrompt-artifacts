Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time and the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value, `cnt` is not defined.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variable `res` has been updated to include the sum of combinations for each value in `num_of_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
