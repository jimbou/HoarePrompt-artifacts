Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `num_of_lens[y]` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_of_lens[x]` is greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers with at least one more element, `x` is the third integer in the list, `res` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been updated to be greater than or equal to 2, since it was previously greater than or equal to 1 and we added 1 to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
