Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the number of combinations when there are at least two sticks of the same length. The current implementation adds the number of combinations of choosing two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length, but it does not consider the case where the third stick is also of the same length as the first two.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2], the program will count the combination (1, 1, 2) twice, once for each of the two sticks of length 2. However, this combination should only be counted once.

To fix this issue, the program should only count the combinations where the third stick is of a different length than the first two. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of combinations where all three sticks are of the same length from the total count.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        res = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
                if cnt >= 3:
                    res -= math.comb(cnt, 3)
        print(res)
```

This corrected code will correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.
