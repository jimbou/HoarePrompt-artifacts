Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, n is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the input list, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, x is the last integer in the list, res is not defined, cnt is not defined, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to the number of integers in the input list. The `num_of_lens` dictionary is populated with the count of each integer in the list. The `nums` list contains all the integers from the input list. The value of `x` is updated to be the last integer in the list. The variables `res` and `cnt` are not defined. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
