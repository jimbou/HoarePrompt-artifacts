Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least one value greater than 0, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is the sum of the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time and 0, and the current value of `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 3.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, which is calculated using the `math.comb` function. The other variables remain unchanged.
