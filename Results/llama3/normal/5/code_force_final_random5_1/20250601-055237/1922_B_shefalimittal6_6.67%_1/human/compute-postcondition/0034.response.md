Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is 1, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens` has been updated to include the first integer in the list as a key with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same number of integers.
