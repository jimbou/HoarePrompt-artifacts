Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 0 integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the dictionary `num_of_lens` contains all the integers from the list `nums` as keys, and their corresponding values are the number of times each integer appears in the list. The variable `x` is the last integer in the list, and the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin contains 0 integers, indicating that all the input has been processed.
