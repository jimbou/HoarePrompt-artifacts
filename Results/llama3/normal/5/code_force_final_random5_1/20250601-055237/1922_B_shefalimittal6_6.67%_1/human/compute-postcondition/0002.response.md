Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - 1 integers.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 0. The value of `n` is now a positive integer, which was read from the input. The `num_of_lens` dictionary is empty, as no operations were performed on it. The `nums` list contains `n` integers, which were read from the input after `n`. The stdin now contains `2*t*n - n - 1` integers, as `n+1` integers were read from the input.
