Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is either the updated value or remains the same as its initial value plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the number of combinations of choosing 3 items from `cnt` items, which is calculated using the `math.comb` function. The other variables remain unchanged.
