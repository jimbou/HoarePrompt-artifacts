Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `res` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been updated to 1, indicating that the second integer in the list (`x`) has been encountered once. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
