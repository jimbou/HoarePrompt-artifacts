Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the input value, num_of_lens is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, x is the last integer in the list. If cnt is 2 or more, res is increased by the number of combinations of cnt taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, and total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, no change is made.***
