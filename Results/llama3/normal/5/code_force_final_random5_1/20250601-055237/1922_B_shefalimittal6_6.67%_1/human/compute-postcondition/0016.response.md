Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least one value, nums is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is the first value in num_of_lens and is greater than or equal to 2, res is the sum of the initial value of res and the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.**

The code calculates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` and assigns it to `total_sum`. Then, it increments `res` by the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements (calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 2)`) and `total_sum`. The value of `res` is updated based on the initial value of `res` and the calculated product. No other variables are affected.
