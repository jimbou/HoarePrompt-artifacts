The code prints the value of `res`, which is the sum of the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time and the number of combinations of each value in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list.
2. For each value in `num_of_lens`, the number of combinations taken 3 at a time is calculated using the formula `nC3 = n! / (3! * (n-3)!)`, where `n` is the value in `num_of_lens`.
3. For each value in `num_of_lens`, the number of combinations taken 2 at a time is calculated using the formula `nC2 = n! / (2! * (n-2)!)`, where `n` is the value in `num_of_lens`.
4. The sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value is calculated.
5. The number of combinations taken 2 at a time is multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value.
6. The sum of the number of combinations taken 3 at a time and the result of step 5 is calculated for each value in `num_of_lens`.
7. The final result is the sum of all the results from step 6.

Since the exact values in `num_of_lens` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of the number of combinations of each value in num_of_lens taken 3 at a time and the number of combinations of each value in num_of_lens taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in num_of_lens except the current value)**
