Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, `res` is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least one value, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0 and its value is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order, multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and also increased by the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time and the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
