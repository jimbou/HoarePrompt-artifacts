To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least one value, the loop will execute. Since `cnt` is not defined before the loop, it needs to be adjusted to take on the first value in `num_of_lens`. Also, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least one value, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is 0, stdin is empty**
