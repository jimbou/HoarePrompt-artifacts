To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least one value, the loop will execute. Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, we can infer that `nums` must have at least one integer for `num_of_lens` to have a value. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is 0, stdin contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`**
