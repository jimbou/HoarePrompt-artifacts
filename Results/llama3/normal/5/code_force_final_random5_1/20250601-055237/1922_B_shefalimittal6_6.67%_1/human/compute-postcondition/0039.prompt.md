Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the input value, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, res is the initial value of res, cnt is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers
Code of the loop:
for x in nums:
    num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is 1, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is 1, and the second integer in the list as a key and its value is 2, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is 1, the second integer in the list as a key and its value is 2, and the third integer in the list as a key and its value is 1 plus the previous value of the third integer in the dictionary, `nums` is a list of n integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `res` is the initial value of res, `cnt` is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) - 1 integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
