Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains 2*t*n integers, where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5. The first integer is n, and the next n integers are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` has been assigned a positive integer value from the input, and the remaining input contains `2*t*n` integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 3*10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5. The first integer in the remaining input is `n`, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that each `a_i` is between 0 and `n`.
