Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is the sum of the initial value of `res` and the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains the same as its initial value. `stdin` contains 2*t*n - n - (n-1) integers.***
