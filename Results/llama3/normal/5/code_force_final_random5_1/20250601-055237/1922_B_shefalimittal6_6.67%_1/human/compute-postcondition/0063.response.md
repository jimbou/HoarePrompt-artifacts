To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute.

At the start of the loop, `x` is the last integer in the list, but for the loop to begin, `x` should be the first integer in the list. Also, since `nums` is a list of `n` integers, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, implying that `nums` must have at least 1 integer.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `res` is not defined, `cnt` is not defined, stdin is empty**
