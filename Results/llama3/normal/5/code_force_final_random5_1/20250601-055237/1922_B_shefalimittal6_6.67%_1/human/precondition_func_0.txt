stdin contains t+2*t*n integers, where t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5. The first integer is t, then for each test case, the first integer is n, and the next n integers are a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= n.
