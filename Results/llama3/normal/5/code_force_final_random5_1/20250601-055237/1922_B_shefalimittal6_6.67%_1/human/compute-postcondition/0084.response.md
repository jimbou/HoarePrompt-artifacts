The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_of_lens` dictionary. If `num_of_lens` has at least two values, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` has at least two values, `cnt` is one of the values in `num_of_lens`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num_of_lens` must have at least two values and `cnt` must be the next value in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens`**
