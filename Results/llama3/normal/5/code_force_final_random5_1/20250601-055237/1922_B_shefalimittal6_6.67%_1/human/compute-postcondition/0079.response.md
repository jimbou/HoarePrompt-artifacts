The only object in the loop head is variable `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least two values the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` has at least one value, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `num_of_lens` must have at least two values and the `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list, and must have at least two values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is a positive integer greater than 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made to the variables.**
