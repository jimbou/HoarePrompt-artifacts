To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values():`, which means the loop iterates over the values of the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `num_of_lens` has at least one value greater than 0, and `cnt` is one of those values.

For the loop to execute again, `num_of_lens` must have at least one more value greater than 0, and `cnt` must be the next value in the iteration.

Since we don't know the exact order of the values in `num_of_lens`, we can't determine the exact value of `cnt` in the next iteration. However, we can say that `cnt` will be the next value in the iteration of `num_of_lens.values()`.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appears in the list and must have at least two values greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `x` is the last integer in the list, `cnt` is the next value in the iteration of `num_of_lens.values()`**
