Output State: `_` is `t`, `n` is a positive integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all integers in `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is the sum of the initial value of `res` and the number of ways to choose 2 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current value, plus the number of ways to choose 3 items from each value in `num_of_lens` without repetition and without order for values that are 3 or more, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`. `stdin` contains 0 integers, and the value of `res` is being printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the final value of `res` is being printed. The loop variable `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`, and `cnt` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The input stream `stdin` is empty, as all input values have been processed.
