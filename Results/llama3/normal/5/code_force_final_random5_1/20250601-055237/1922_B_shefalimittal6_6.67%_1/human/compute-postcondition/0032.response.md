Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the input value, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers from stdin, res is the initial value of res, cnt is not defined, stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, overwriting its initial value. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `nums`. The value of `num_of_lens` is not affected by the code and remains an empty dictionary. The value of `res` is not modified by the code and remains its initial value. The value of `cnt` is not defined after the code execution. The stdin contains 2*t*n - 2*n - (n-1) integers after the code execution.
