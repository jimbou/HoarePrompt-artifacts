Output State: **The loop has executed for all test cases. For each test case, if k is greater than or equal to 2, then if n equals k, a list of k elements, all of which are equal to k, has been printed. Otherwise, -1 has been printed. If k is less than 2, a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) has been printed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, if the number of sorted cyclic shifts (k) is 2 or more, then if the length of the array (n) is equal to k, a list of k elements all equal to k has been printed. If k is 2 or more but n is not equal to k, -1 has been printed. If k is less than 2, a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) has been printed.
