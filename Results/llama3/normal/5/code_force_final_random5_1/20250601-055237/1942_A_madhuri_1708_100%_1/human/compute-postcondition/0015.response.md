According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If the stdin has at least 2 lines the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin has at least 1 line, `s` is the second line. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least 2 lines and the `s` is the third line.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 2 lines, `s` is the third line. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements all equal to `k` is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, the numbers from 1 to n are being printed.**
