Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers that are assigned values from the third line of stdin, stdin contains at least one line of input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are now assigned from the third line of stdin, which contains at least two integers separated by a space. The stdin still contains at least one line of input, as the third line has been consumed to assign values to `n` and `k`.
