Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), representing the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts the array must have.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k >= 2:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            print('-1')
    else:
        print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, `s` is the second line. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements all equal to `k` is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, the numbers from 1 to n are being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers that are assigned values from the third line of stdin, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements all equal to `k` is being printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, the numbers from 1 to n are being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers that are assigned values from the third line of stdin, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are equal to `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
