Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program correctly handles the case when `k` is greater than or equal to 2. In this case, it checks if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it prints a list of `k` elements, all of which are equal to `k`. This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this list will be sorted. If `n` is not equal to `k`, it prints -1, which is also correct because it's impossible to have more than one sorted cyclic shift for a list of length `n` when `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
*   The program correctly handles the case when `k` is less than 2. In this case, it prints a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This is a valid solution because the list itself is sorted, and all other cyclic shifts will not be sorted (except for the case when `n` equals `k`, which is handled separately).

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases and prints valid solutions or -1 as required.

Correctness: **True**
