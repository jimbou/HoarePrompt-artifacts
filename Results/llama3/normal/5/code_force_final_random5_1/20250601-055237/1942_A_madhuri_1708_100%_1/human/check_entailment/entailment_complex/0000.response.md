Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
2. For each test case, it takes two integers n and k as input, representing the length of an array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts.
3. If k is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if n equals k. If true, it prints a list of k elements, all equal to k. This is a valid solution because if all elements are equal, then all cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. If k is greater than or equal to 2 and n is not equal to k, it prints -1. This is correct because if k is greater than or equal to 2, then there must be at least two sorted cyclic shifts, but if n is not equal to k, then there can be at most one sorted cyclic shift (the one where all elements are equal).
5. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive). This is a valid solution because if k is less than 2, then there must be at most one sorted cyclic shift, and the list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
