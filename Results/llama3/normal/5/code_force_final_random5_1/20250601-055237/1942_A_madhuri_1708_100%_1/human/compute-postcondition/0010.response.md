Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, `s` is the second line. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements all equal to `k` is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed.**
