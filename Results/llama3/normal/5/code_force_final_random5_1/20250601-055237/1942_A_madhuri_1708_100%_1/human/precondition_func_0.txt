stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), representing the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts the array must have.
