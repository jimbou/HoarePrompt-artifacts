Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, `s` is the second line. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements all equal to `k` is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, the numbers from 1 to n are being printed.***
