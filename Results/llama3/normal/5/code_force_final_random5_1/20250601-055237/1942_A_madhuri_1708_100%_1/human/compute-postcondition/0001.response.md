Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, `s` is the second line**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are integers that are obtained by splitting the second line of input (`s`) into two parts and converting them to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but at least one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `s` remains the same, which is the second line of input.
