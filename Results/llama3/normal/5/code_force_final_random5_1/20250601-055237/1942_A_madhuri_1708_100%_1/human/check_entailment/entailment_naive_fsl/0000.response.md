Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n = 3` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, the program should output an array `a` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program outputs the array `[1, 2, 3]`, which has only one sorted cyclic shift (`[1, 2, 3]` itself), whereas the problem requires exactly `k = 1` sorted cyclic shifts.

The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and if so, it outputs either an array of all `k`s or `-1` if `n` is not equal to `k`. However, it does not handle the case when `k` is 1 correctly.
