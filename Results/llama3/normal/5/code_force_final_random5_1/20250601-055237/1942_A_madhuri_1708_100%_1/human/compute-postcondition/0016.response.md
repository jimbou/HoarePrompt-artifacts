Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers that are assigned values from the third line of stdin, stdin contains at least one line of input, if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements all equal to `k` is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, the numbers from 1 to n are being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the third line of stdin. The stdin now contains at least one line of input, as the third line has been consumed. The printing behavior remains the same as in the initial state, depending on the values of `k` and `n`.
