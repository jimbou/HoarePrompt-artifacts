The only object in the loop head is the file object `open(0)`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object `open(0)`. If the file object has at least one more line to read, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the file object has been read up to the third line. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the file object must have at least one more line to read.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers that are assigned values from the third line of stdin, stdin contains at least two lines of input.**
