The `print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])` statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer.

Since `n` is an integer, the `range(n)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The list comprehension `[(j + 1) for j in range(n)]` will then add 1 to each number in the sequence, resulting in a list of numbers from 1 to `n`.

The `*` operator is used to unpack the list, so the `print` statement will print each number in the list as a separate argument.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the integer n)**
