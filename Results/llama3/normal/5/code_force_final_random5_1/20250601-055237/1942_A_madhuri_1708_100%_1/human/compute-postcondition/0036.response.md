Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. For each test case, it takes two integers n and k as input, representing the length of an array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts. If k is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if n equals k. If true, it prints a list of k elements, all equal to k. If false, it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive). The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.**
