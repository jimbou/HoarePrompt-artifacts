Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers that are assigned values from the third line of stdin, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements all equal to `k` is being printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, the numbers from 1 to n are being printed.***
