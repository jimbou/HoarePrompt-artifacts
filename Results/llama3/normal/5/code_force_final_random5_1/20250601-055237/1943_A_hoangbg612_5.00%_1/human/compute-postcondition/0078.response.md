Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N, cur is the smallest integer i such that M[i] > i, and i is equal to cur - 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `cur` will be the smallest integer `i` such that the value of `M` at index `i` is greater than `i`. The value of `i` will be one less than the value of `cur`. The other variables, `T`, `S`, `N`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
