Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, cur is 0, i is 0, and the current value of M[i] is less than or equal to i.**

The code block consists of two lines: `cur = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, making `cur` equal to 0. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables. 

The initial state is preserved for all variables except `cur`, which is updated to 0. The value of `i` remains 0, and the condition `M[i]` being less than or equal to `i` is still valid. The other variables `T`, `S`, `N`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
