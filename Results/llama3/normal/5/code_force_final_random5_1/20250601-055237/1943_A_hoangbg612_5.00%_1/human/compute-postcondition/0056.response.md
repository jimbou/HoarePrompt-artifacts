Output State: **`T` is at least 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second smallest integer in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value is increased by 1, `cur` is -1, and `i` is -1, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `cur` and `i` have been updated to -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` now has an updated value for the key `cur`.
