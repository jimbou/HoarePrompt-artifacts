Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, cur is equal to i, i is incremented by 1**

In this code block, the first line assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, effectively setting `cur` equal to `i`. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables but rather exits the loop or control structure it is part of, if any. Since there are no other operations or assignments in the code snippet, the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is already stated to be incremented by 1 in the initial state, and this change is not reverted or modified by the provided code.
