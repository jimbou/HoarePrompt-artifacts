Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, num is the second smallest integer in N, cur is equal to num + 1, M is a dictionary with num as a key and its value is 1, and i remains unchanged.**

The code block increments the value of `cur` by 1, making it equal to `num + 1`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `stdin`, `num`, `M`, and `i` remain unchanged.
