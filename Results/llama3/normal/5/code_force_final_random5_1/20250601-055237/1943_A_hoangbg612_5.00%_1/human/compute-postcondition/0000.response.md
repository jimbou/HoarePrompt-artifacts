Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a list of integers (0 <= integer < 2 * 10^5). The sum of the lengths of the lists over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^4. The remaining test cases in stdin each contain a list of integers, with the first integer of each test case already consumed by the input statement. The sum of the lengths of these lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
