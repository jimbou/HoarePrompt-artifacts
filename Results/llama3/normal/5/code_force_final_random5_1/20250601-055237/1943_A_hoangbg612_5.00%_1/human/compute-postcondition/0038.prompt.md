Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty. If the sum of the counts of all integers in M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list plus one. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty. If the current value of M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is 0 and i is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, if M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is 1 and i is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, cur is at least 2, i is 2. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, cur is 2, i is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
