Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, M is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty, and if num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is 0, i is -1, and num is at least 1. Otherwise, the values of cur, i, and num remain unchanged.***
