Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, cur is equal to num, M[cur] is 1, stdin is empty.**

The code block assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, making `cur` equal to the third integer in the sorted list `N`. Then, it assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`, which is the dictionary entry corresponding to the key `cur`. The state of the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, and `stdin` remains unchanged.
