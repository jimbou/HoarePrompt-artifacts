To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, we know that `cur` is either the largest integer in the original list `N` or the largest integer in the original list `N` plus 1, depending on the sum of the values in dictionary `M`. Since `N` is an empty list, the largest integer in `N` is undefined. However, we can infer that `cur` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cur` to be at least 1. We can also adjust the state of `i` to be 0, since it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N, cur is at least 1, i is 0**
