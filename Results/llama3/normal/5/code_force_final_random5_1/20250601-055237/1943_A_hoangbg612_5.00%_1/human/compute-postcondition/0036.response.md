The code snippet consists of two lines: `cur = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, and the second line is a break statement that terminates the loop.

Since `i` is 2, `cur` becomes 2. No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, cur is 2, i is 2**
