To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` has at least one element. Since `N` is a sorted list of integers, we can assume that if it has at least one element, it will be the smallest integer in the list.

State: **`T` is at least 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `i` is -1, `stdin` is empty, `num` is the smallest integer in `N`**
