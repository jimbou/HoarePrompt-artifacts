The value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` is unknown, so the output state is: The value of `M[cur]` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin is empty, num is the third integer in the list, and the value of `M[cur]` is increased by 1**
