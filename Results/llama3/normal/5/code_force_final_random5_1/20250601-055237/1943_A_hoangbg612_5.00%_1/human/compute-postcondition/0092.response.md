To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for num in N:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `num` and `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least one more integer. Since `N` is sorted, the next integer in the list must be greater than or equal to the current first integer in the list.

The state of `num` is not explicitly mentioned, but since it is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the next integer in the list `N`.

The other variables `T`, `S`, `stdin`, and `M` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer equal to the first input, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `stdin` is empty**
