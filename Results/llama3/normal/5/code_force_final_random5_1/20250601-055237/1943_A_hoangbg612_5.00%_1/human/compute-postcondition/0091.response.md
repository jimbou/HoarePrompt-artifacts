Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, stdin is empty. If the first integer in the list is greater than the current value, a dictionary M is created with the first integer as the key and 1 as the value, and the current value is updated to the first integer. Otherwise, a dictionary M is created with the current value as the key and 1 as the value.***
