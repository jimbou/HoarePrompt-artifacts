The code prints the value of `cur`, which is the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] > i`. Since `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `N` and its value is the number of times the integer appears in `N`, and `N` is an empty list, `M` is also empty. Therefore, there is no integer `i` such that `M[i] > i`, and `cur` is not defined.

However, since `i` is equal to `cur - 1`, and `cur` is not defined, `i` is also not defined.

Output: **None**
