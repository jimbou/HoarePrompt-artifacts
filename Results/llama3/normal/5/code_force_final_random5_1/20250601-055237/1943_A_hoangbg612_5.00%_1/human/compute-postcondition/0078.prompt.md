Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N, if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the largest integer in the original list N plus 1, otherwise cur remains the largest integer in the original list N, and i is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N. If the value of M at index i is less than or equal to i, then cur is equal to i and i is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N. If the value of M at index i is less than or equal to i, then cur is equal to i. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then i is increased by 1 and cur is equal to i. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
