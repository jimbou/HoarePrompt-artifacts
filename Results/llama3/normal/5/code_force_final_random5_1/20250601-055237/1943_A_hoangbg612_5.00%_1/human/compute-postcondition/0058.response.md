To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for num in N:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `num` and `N`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `N` has at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second smallest integer in `N`. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least one more element, and `num` should be the next integer in the list.

State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, num is the third smallest integer in N**
