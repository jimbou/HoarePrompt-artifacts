The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `cur`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. If `cur` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cur` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `cur` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 1.
State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, cur is greater than 0, i is 1**
