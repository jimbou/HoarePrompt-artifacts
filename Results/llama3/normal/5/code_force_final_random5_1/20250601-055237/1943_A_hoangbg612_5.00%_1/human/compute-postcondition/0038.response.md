Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, cur is equal to the index of the first element in M that is greater than its index, i is equal to cur.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to iterate until it finds an element in the list M that is greater than its index. At that point, the loop will exit, and the value of cur will be set to the index of that element. The value of i will also be set to cur. The other variables, T, S, N, and stdin, will remain unchanged.
