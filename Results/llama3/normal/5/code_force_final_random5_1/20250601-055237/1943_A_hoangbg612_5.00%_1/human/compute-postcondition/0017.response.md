Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin is empty, and num is the second integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, cur is set to num and M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, cur remains -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and num is less than or equal to cur. In the else case, cur is the second integer in the list, M is a dictionary with key cur and value 2, and num is equal to cur.***
