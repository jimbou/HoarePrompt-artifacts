Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N, cur is the largest integer in the original list N, and i is -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

* The time T is still at least 0, and the integer S remains unchanged.
* The list N is now empty because the loop has iterated over all its elements.
* The standard input stdin remains empty.
* The dictionary M now contains all the integers from the original list N as keys, and their corresponding values represent the frequency of each integer in the original list N.
* The variable cur is set to the largest integer in the original list N.
* The variable i remains unchanged at -1.
