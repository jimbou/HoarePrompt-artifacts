Postcondition: ***T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then i is increased by 1 and cur is equal to i. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
