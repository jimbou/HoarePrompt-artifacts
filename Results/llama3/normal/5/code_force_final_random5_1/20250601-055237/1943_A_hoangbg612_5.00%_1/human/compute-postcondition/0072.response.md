The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and cur, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cur`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `cur` must be greater than 0.
State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N. If the value of M at index i is less than or equal to i, then cur is equal to i and i is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
