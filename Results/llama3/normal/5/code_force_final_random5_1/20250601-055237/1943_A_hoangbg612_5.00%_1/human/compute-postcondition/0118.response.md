Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a list with at least one element, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty. If the sum of the counts of all unique integers in M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the sorted list of integers from the second input plus one and i is -1. Otherwise, cur is the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i and i is equal to cur.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The time T is at least 1.
* The variable S remains unchanged and is equal to the first input.
* The list N contains at least one element.
* The dictionary M remains unchanged and contains the unique integers from the second input as keys and their respective counts as values.
* The standard input stdin is empty.
* If the sum of the counts of all unique integers in M equals S, then the variable cur is set to the last integer in the sorted list of integers from the second input plus one, and the variable i is set to -1.
* Otherwise, the variable cur is set to the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i, and the variable i is set to cur.
