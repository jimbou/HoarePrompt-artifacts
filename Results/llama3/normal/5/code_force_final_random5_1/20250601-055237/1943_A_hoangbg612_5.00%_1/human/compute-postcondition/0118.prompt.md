Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty. If the sum of the counts of all unique integers in M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the sorted list of integers from the second input plus one and i is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty. If the value of M at index i is less than or equal to i, then cur is 0 and i is 0. Otherwise, the values of cur and i remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is equal to i and i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a list with at least one element, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is equal to i. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
