Postcondition: ***T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin is empty. If num is greater than cur, then num is the second smallest integer in N, cur is the second smallest integer in N, M is a dictionary with the second smallest integer in N as a key and its value is 1, and i remains unchanged. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with cur as a key and its value is increased by 1, cur is -1, and i is -1.***
