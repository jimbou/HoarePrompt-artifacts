Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third smallest integer in N, cur is 1 more than its original value**

The code block consists of two lines: `cur += 1` and `break`. The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

The initial state provides information about the variables T, S, N, and num. T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, and num is the third smallest integer in N. The stdin is empty.

After executing the code, the only variable that is modified is `cur`, which is incremented by 1. The values of T, S, N, and num remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty.

Therefore, the final output state includes the updated value of `cur`, which is 1 more than its original value, and the unchanged values of T, S, N, and num.
