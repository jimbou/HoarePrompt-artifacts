According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. If `cur` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer equal to the first input, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, `stdin` is empty. If the sum of the counts of all unique integers in `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is the last integer in the sorted list of integers from the second input plus one and `i` is -1. So for the loop to be executed `cur` must be at least 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer equal to the first input, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, `stdin` is empty, `cur` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
