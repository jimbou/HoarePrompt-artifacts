Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and deleting them, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the remaining array.

The program first reads the number of test cases (T) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (S) and the array itself (N). It then sorts the array and initializes a dictionary (M) to count the occurrences of each unique integer in the array.

The program then iterates over the sorted array, updating the count of each unique integer in the dictionary. If the count of an integer is greater than the integer itself, it breaks the loop and sets the current integer (cur) to the smallest integer that meets this condition.

If the sum of the counts of all unique integers equals the size of the array (S), the program sets the current integer (cur) to the last integer in the sorted array plus one. Otherwise, it sets the current integer (cur) to the smallest integer that meets the condition.

Finally, the program prints the current integer (cur) as the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
