Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, cur is incremented by 1, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `cur += 1` and `break`. The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `cur`, we can only conclude that `cur` is incremented by 1 from its original value. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or the program state.

The initial state provides information about the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num`, as well as the state of `stdin`. Since none of these variables are modified by the code snippet, their values remain the same. The only change is the increment of `cur` by 1.
