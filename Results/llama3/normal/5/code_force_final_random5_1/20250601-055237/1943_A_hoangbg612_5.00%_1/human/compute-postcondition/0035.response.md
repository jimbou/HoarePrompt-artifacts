To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(cur):`. The objects involved are `i` and `cur`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is 1, and `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

However, the loop will only execute again if `cur` is greater than or equal to 2, because `range(cur)` will generate numbers up to `cur-1`. Therefore, `cur` must be at least 2.

The other variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `stdin`, and `M` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `M` is a list, `cur` is at least 2, `i` is 2**
