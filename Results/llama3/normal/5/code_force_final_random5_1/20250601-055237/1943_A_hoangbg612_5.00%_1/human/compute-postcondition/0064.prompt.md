Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, i is -1, and stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is at least 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` is empty, `num` is the smallest integer in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is 1, `cur` is equal to `num`, and `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value is increased by 1, `cur` is -1, and `i` is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin is empty. If num is greater than cur, then num is the second smallest integer in N, cur is the second smallest integer in N, M is a dictionary with the second smallest integer in N as a key and its value is 1, and i remains unchanged. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with cur as a key and its value is increased by 1, cur is -1, and i is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, num is the third smallest integer in N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
