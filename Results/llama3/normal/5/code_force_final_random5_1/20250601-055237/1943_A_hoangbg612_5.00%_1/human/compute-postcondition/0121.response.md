Output State: **T is 0, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a list with at least one element, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty. If the sum of the counts of all unique integers in M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the sorted list of integers from the second input plus one and i is -1. Otherwise, cur is the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i and i is equal to cur, and cur is printed**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases (T) will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, with S being an integer equal to the first input, N being a list with at least one element, M being a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, and stdin being empty. The values of cur and i depend on whether the sum of the counts of all unique integers in M equals S. If it does, cur will be the last integer in the sorted list of integers from the second input plus one, and i will be -1. Otherwise, cur will be the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i, and i will be equal to cur. Finally, the value of cur will be printed.
