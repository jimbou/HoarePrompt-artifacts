The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 1 element, num is the smallest integer in N. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second smallest integer in N.
State: **`T` is at least 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, `num` is the second smallest integer in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is 1, `cur` is equal to `num`, and `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value is increased by 1, `cur` is -1, and `i` is -1.**
