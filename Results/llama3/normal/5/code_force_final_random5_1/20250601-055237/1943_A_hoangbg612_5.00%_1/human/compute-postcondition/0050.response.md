Output State: **`T` is at least 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value is increased by 1, `cur` is -1, `i` is -1, `stdin` is empty, `num` is the smallest integer in `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` is increased by 1, where `cur` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` now contains the key `-1` with an incremented value. The rest of the variables maintain their initial state.
