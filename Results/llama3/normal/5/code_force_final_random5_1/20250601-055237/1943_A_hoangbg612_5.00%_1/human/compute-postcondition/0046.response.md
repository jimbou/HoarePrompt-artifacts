Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is an empty dictionary, cur is 0, i is -1, stdin is empty, num is the smallest integer in N, the current value of num is greater than the current value of cur and num is greater than cur + 1.**

The code block increments the value of `cur` by 1, changing it from -1 to 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
