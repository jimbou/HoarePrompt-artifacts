Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, cur is one more than its original value, stdin is empty.**

Explanation: The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
