Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty, `num` is the smallest integer in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `cur`, `i` remain unchanged.***
