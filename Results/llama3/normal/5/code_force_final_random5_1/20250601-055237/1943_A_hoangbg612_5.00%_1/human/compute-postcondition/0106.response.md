Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, cur is the last integer in the sorted list of integers from the second input plus one, i is -1, stdin is empty, and the sum of the counts of all unique integers in M equals S.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The sum of the counts of all unique integers in `M` still equals `S`, and `stdin` remains empty.
