Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin is empty, and num is the first integer in the list. If the first integer in the list (num) is greater than the current value of cur (which is -1) by more than 1, then cur is updated to 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
