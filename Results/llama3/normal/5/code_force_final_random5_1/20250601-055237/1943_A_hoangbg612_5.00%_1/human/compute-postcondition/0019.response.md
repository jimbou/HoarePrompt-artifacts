Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin is empty, and num is the third integer in the list, cur is one more than its original value.**

The code block increments the value of `cur` by 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty.
