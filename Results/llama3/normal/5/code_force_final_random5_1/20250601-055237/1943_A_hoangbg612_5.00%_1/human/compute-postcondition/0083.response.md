The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N. If the list N has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, i is -1, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list N must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, i is -1, stdin is empty, num is the first integer in the list**
