To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`. The loop will execute again if `N` has at least one more integer to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second integer in the list `N`. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least one more integer, and `num` should be the next integer in the list.

State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin is empty, and num is the third integer in the list.**
