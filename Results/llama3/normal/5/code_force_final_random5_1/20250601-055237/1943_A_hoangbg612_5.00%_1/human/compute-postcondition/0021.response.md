Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin is empty, cur is the third integer in the list, and M[cur] is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, which means `cur` now holds the value of the third integer in the list `N`. Since `num` is the third integer in the list, `cur` is now equal to this value. The second line assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`, which means the value of `M` at the index equal to the third integer in the list `N` is now 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
