To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head `for num in N:` and adjust the states of objects within it.

1. **N**: Since `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, for the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least 3 integers.

2. **num**: At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second integer in the list. For the loop to execute again, `num` should be the third integer in the list.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, stdin is empty.**
