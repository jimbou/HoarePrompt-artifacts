Postcondition: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, i is -1, stdin is empty, and the current value of num is greater than the current value of cur, which is -1, meaning num is at least 0. Additionally, the current value of num is greater than cur + 1, meaning num is at least 1.**
