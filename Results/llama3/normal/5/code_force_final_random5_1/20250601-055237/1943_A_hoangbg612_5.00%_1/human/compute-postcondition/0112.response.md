To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(cur):`. The objects involved are `i` and `cur`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is either 0 or unchanged (if the condition `M[i] <= i` was not met). Since `i` is the loop variable, its value is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `cur` must be greater than the current value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `cur` by at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty, cur is incremented by at least 1, i is incremented by 1**
