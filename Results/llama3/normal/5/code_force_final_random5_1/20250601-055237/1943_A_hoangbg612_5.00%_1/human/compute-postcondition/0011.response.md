Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin is empty, num is the first integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, cur is set to num and M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, cur remains -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and num is less than or equal to cur.***
