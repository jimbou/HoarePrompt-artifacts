Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with 1 key-value pair where the key is the smallest integer in N and the value is 1, stdin is empty, num is the smallest integer in N, cur is equal to the smallest integer in N, and i remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to the smallest integer in `N`, which is also the value of `num`. The dictionary `M` now contains a single key-value pair where the key is the smallest integer in `N` (i.e., `cur` or `num`) and the value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
