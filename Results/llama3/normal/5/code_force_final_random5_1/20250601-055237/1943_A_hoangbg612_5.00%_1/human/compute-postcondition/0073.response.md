Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list N and its value is the number of times the integer appears in N, cur is equal to i if the value of M at index i is less than or equal to i, otherwise no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is at least 0. The value of S also remains unchanged as it is an integer. The list N remains empty. The stdin remains empty as no input is taken. The dictionary M remains unchanged as it still contains the count of each integer in the original list N. The variable cur is assigned the value of i only if the count of i in M is less than or equal to i, otherwise, its value remains unchanged.
