Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin is empty, num is the second integer in the list. If num is greater than cur + 1, cur is incremented by 1. Otherwise, cur remains unchanged, and M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and num is less than or equal to cur.***
