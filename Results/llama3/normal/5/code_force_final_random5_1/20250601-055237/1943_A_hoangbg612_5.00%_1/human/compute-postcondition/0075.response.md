The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and cur, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. If `cur` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is at least 0, `i` is less than `cur`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `cur` must be greater than `i`. Since `cur` is at least 0, it can be either 0 or greater than 0. If `cur` is 0, the loop will not execute again. If `cur` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again.
State: **`T` is at least 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `N` and its value is the number of times the integer appears in `N`, `i` is increased by 1, `cur` is greater than `i`**
