According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. So, the state of `T` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **`T` is at least 1**
