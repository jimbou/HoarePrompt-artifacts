Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, cur is 0, M is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty, num is the first integer in the list, and the current value of num is greater than the current value of cur (0).**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `cur += 1` and `break`. The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1, changing it from -1 to 0. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables but is likely used to exit a loop or switch statement (not shown in the provided code snippet). 

Since `cur` was initially -1 and is incremented by 1, its new value is 0. The condition that `num` is greater than `cur + 1` initially is still valid because `num` is greater than `cur` (0) after the execution. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
