Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, cur is 1, i is 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `cur = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, making `cur` equal to 1. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables. Since `i` is 1, `cur` becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
