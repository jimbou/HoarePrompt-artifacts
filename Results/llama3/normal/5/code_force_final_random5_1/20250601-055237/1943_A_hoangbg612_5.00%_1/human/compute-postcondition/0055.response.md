Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, num is the second smallest integer in N, cur is the second smallest integer in N, M is a dictionary with the second smallest integer in N as a key and its value is 1, and i remains unchanged.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Since `num` is the second smallest integer in `N`, `cur` becomes the second smallest integer in `N`. The second line assigns the value 1 to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Since `cur` is now the second smallest integer in `N`, the dictionary `M` now has the second smallest integer in `N` as a key with a value of 1.

All other variables remain unchanged. `T` is still at least 0, `S` is still an integer, `N` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` is still empty, and `i` remains unchanged.
