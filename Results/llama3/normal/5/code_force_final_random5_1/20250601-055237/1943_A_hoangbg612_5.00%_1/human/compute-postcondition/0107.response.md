Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty. If the sum of the counts of all unique integers in M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the sorted list of integers from the second input plus one and i is -1.***
