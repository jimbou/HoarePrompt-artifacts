Output State: **T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third smallest integer in N, cur is equal to num, M[cur] is 1**

The code assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, effectively updating `cur` to be equal to the third smallest integer in the sorted list `N`. Then, it sets the value of `M[cur]` to 1, where `cur` is now the index or key in the dictionary or data structure `M`. The values of `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged, as they are not directly modified by the code. The relationship between `num` and `cur` is updated, and `M[cur]` is assigned a new value.
