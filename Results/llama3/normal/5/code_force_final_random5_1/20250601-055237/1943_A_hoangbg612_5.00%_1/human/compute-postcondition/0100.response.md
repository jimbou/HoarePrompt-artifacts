Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, stdin is empty. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is one more than its original value. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
