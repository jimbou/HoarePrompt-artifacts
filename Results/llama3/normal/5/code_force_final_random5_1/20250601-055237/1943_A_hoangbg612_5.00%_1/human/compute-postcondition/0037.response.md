Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, cur is at least 2, i is 2. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, M is a list, cur is 2, i is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
