Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game's strategy to maximize the MEX of the array c. The program first sorts the input array N and then iterates through it, keeping track of the current maximum value (cur) and a dictionary M to store the count of each number.

The program correctly handles the case where the input array N contains duplicate numbers by incrementing the count in the dictionary M. It also correctly handles the case where the input array N contains numbers greater than the current maximum value (cur) by breaking the loop and incrementing cur.

The program then checks if the sum of the counts in the dictionary M is equal to the size of the input array N. If it is, it increments cur by 1. This is because if all numbers in the input array N are used, the MEX of the array c will be one more than the maximum value in the array.

Finally, the program iterates through the dictionary M and checks if the count of each number is less than or equal to the number itself. If it finds such a number, it sets cur to that number and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX of the array c will be the smallest number that is not present in the array.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
