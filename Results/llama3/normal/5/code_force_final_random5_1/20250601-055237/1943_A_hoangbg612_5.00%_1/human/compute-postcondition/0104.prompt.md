Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers from the second input, M is an empty dictionary, cur is -1, i is -1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, stdin is empty. If the first integer in the list is greater than the current value, a dictionary M is created with the first integer as the key and 1 as the value, and the current value is updated to the first integer. Otherwise, a dictionary M is created with the current value as the key and 1 as the value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, stdin is empty. If num is larger than cur, then cur is set to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1. stdin remains empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
