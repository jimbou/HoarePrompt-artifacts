Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary with key cur=-1 and value 1, cur is -1, i is -1, stdin is empty, num is the first integer in the list, and num is less than or equal to cur**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1, resulting in M[cur] = 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
