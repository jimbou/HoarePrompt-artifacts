Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` is empty, `num` is the smallest integer in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is 1, `cur` is equal to `num`, and `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value is increased by 1, `cur` is -1, and `i` is -1.***
