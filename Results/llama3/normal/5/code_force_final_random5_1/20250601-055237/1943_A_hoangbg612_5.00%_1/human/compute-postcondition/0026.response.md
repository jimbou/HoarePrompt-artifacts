Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin is empty, cur is the last integer in the original list plus one, M is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in the original list and the values are the counts of each integer. The sum of the counts of all integers in M equals S.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` still contains the counts of each integer in the original list, and the sum of these counts is still equal to `S`.
