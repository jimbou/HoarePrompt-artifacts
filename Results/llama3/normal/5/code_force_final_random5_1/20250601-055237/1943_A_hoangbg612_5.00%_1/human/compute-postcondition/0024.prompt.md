Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin is empty, num is the first integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, cur is set to num and M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, cur remains -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and num is less than or equal to cur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin is empty, and num is the second integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, cur is set to num and M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, cur remains -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and num is less than or equal to cur. In the else case, cur is the second integer in the list, M is a dictionary with key cur and value 2, and num is equal to cur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin is empty, and the value of M[cur] is 1 if the third integer in the list is larger than cur. Otherwise, the value of M[cur] is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
