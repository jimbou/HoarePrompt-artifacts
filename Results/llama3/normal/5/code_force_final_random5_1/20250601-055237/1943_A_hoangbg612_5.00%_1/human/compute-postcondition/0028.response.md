To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`T` is at least 1, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `cur` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
