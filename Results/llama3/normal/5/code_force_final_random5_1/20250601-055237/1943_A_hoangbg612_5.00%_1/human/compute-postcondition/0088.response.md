Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the value of num and the value is 1, cur is equal to num, i is -1, and num is at least 1.**

The code assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, and then adds a key-value pair to the dictionary `M` where the key is the value of `cur` (which is now equal to `num`) and the value is 1. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged.
