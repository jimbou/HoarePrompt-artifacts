Postcondition: ***T is at least 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, num is the second smallest integer in N. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is set to num + 1, M is a dictionary with num as a key and its value is 1, and i remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
