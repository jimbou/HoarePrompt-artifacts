Output State: **T is at least 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, cur is -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, stdin is empty, num is the first integer in the list, and num is less than or equal to cur**

In this output state, the value of M has been updated to include the key -1 with a value of 1, since M[cur] += 1 and cur is -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
