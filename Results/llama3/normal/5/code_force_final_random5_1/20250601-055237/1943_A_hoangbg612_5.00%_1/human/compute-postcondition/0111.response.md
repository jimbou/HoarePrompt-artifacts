Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, S is an integer equal to the first input, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from the second input and the values are their respective counts, stdin is empty. If the value of M at index i is less than or equal to i, then cur is 0 and i is 0. Otherwise, the values of cur and i remain unchanged.***
