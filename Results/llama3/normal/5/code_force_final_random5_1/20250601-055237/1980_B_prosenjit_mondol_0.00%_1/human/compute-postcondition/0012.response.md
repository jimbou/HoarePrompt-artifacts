Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, _ is 0, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is the integer at index f of the original list a, stdin is empty. If the integer at index k of the list a is less than the integer at index f of the original list a, 'YES' is printed. If the integer at index k of the list a is less than or equal to the integer at index f of the original list a, the integer at index k of the list a is larger than or equal to x, and either 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 1 or the integer at index k - 1 of the list a is less than x, or 'MAYBE' is printed if k is not equal to n - 1 and the integer at index k - 1 of the list a is not less than x.***
