Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the cube at the k-th position after sorting, and there are other cubes with the same value that are not removed. In this case, the program prints 'YES', but the correct answer should be 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on its original position.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will print 'YES', but the correct answer is 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube (with value 3) may or may not be removed depending on its original position.
