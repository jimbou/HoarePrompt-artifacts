Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is not less than x, either 'YES' or 'MAYBE' is printed depending on whether k is equal to n - 1 or a[k - 1] is less than x.***
