To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the conditions and variables involved.

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `f` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - `x` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f` after sorting.
   - The condition checks two scenarios:
     - If `k` is equal to `n - 1`, it prints 'YES'.
     - If `a[k - 1]` is less than `x`, it prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Since `a` is sorted in descending order, the largest element is at index 0, and the smallest element is at index `n - 1` (assuming `n` is the length of `a`).
   - The value of `x` is determined by `a[f]`, meaning it's the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`.
   - The condition `k == n - 1` checks if `k` is equal to the last index of `a`. If true, it prints 'YES' regardless of the values of `a[k - 1]` and `x`.
   - The condition `a[k - 1] < x` compares the element before the `k`th index in `a` with `x`. If `a[k - 1]` is less than `x`, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - Without explicit values for `n`, `f`, `k`, and the elements of `a`, we cannot compute an exact numerical output.
   - However, based on the conditions provided, the output depends on whether `k` equals `n - 1` or if `a[k - 1]` is less than `x`.

Given the lack of specific values for `n`, `f`, `k`, and the elements of `a`, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **'YES' if k equals n - 1 or a[k - 1] is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE'**
