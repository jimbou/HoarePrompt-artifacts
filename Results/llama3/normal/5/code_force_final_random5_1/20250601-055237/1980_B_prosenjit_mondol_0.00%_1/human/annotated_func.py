#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the program has printed 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case. The output is based on the relationship between the integer at index k of the sorted list a and the integer at index f of the original list a. If the integer at index k is greater than the integer at index f, 'NO' is printed. If the integer at index k is less than the integer at index f, 'YES' is printed. If the integer at index k is less than or equal to the integer at index f, the program checks if k is equal to n - 1 or if the integer at index k - 1 is less than x. If either condition is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed. The program has processed all test cases and has finished executing.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers and two indices. It determines whether the integer at a specified index in the sorted list is greater than, less than, or equal to the integer at another specified index in the original list, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' accordingly. The function handles all test cases and provides a final output based on the relationships between the integers at the specified indices.
