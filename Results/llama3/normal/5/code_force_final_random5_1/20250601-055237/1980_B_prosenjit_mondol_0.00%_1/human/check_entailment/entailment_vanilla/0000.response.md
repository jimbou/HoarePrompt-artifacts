Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes (n), the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (f), and the number of removed cubes (k). It then subtracts 1 from f and k because list indices in Python start at 0.

3. The program then reads the values shown on the cubes and stores them in a list (a).

4. It finds the value of Dmitry's favorite cube (x) by accessing the list at index f.

5. The program sorts the list of cube values in descending order.

6. It then checks if the value of the k-th cube (after sorting) is greater than the value of Dmitry's favorite cube. If it is, the program prints 'NO' because Dmitry's favorite cube will not be removed in any case.

7. If the value of the k-th cube is less than the value of Dmitry's favorite cube, the program prints 'YES' because Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases.

8. If the value of the k-th cube is equal to the value of Dmitry's favorite cube, the program checks if k is equal to n - 1 (i.e., all cubes with the same value as Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed) or if the value of the (k - 1)-th cube is less than the value of Dmitry's favorite cube (i.e., Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed). If either condition is true, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because Dmitry's favorite cube may be either removed or left.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
