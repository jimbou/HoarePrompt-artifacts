Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f after sorting, stdin is empty. If the element at index k of the list a is greater than the element at index f of the list a, 'NO' is printed. If the element at index k of the list a is less than the element at index f of the list a, 'YES' is printed. If the element at index k of the list a is equal to the element at index f of the list a, then if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k - 1 of the list a is less than the element at index f of the list a, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.***
