Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers and two indices. It determines whether the integer at a specified index in the sorted list is greater than, less than, or equal to the integer at another specified index in the original list, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' accordingly. The function handles all test cases and provides a final output based on the relationships between the integers at the specified indices.**
