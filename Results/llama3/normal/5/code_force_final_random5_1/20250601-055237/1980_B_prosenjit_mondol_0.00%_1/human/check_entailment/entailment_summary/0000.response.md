Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. The program first reads the input, sorts the list of cube values in descending order, and then checks the relationship between the value of the favorite cube and the value of the cube at the k-th position. If the favorite cube's value is greater than the k-th cube's value, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed. If the favorite cube's value is less than the k-th cube's value, it prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite cube will not be removed. If the favorite cube's value is equal to the k-th cube's value, it checks if the k-th cube is the last cube or if the (k-1)-th cube's value is less than the favorite cube's value. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. This logic correctly covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output for each test case.


Correctness: **True**
