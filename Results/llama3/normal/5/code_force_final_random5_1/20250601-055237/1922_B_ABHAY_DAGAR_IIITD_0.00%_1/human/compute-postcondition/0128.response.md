The code prints the second element in the list `results` which is `result`. 
`result` is the value of `res` that must have at least 2 elements. 
`res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0.
Output: **the value of res (where res is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is 0)**
