Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `results` is empty, indicating that all elements in the list have been printed. The other variables remain unchanged, with `test_cases`, `num_list` remaining empty, `n` remaining an integer, `num_of_lens` remaining a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` remaining greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise 0, and `total_count` remaining the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.
