Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), results has one more element appended to it, _ is 1, stdin is empty**

The code executes the following operations:

1. `n = int(input())`: Assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Stdin now contains one less integer.

2. `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Assigns a list of integers from stdin to `num_list`. Stdin is now empty.

3. `num_of_lens = {}`: Initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`.

The final state is a combination of the initial state and the changes made by the code. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input from stdin. The value of `num_list` is updated to the list of integers from stdin. The value of `num_of_lens` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The value of `total_count` is not explicitly updated in the code, but it can be calculated as the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`. Since `num_of_lens` is empty, `total_count` is 0. The value of `results` has one more element appended to it, but the value of this element is not specified in the code. Stdin is now empty.
