The only object in the loop head is `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least 2 key-value pairs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` has at least 1 key-value pair. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `num_of_lens` must have at least 2 key-value pairs.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is `cnt` plus its previous value. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to be `res` plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` divided by 2 times `total_count`.**
