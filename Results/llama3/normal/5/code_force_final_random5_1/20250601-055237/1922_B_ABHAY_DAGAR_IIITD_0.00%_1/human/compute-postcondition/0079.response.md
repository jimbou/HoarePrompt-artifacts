Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt) + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt) + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt) + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt) + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt)`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 2, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt + cnt`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, results, and the input integer and list of integers from stdin remain unchanged. The dictionary of unique integers and their counts also remains unchanged. The value of `cnt` is still greater than or equal to 2. However, the value of `total_count` has been updated to be the sum of `cnt` and itself, which is now `cnt + cnt + cnt`. The value of `res` in the `results` list has been updated accordingly based on the new value of `total_count`.
