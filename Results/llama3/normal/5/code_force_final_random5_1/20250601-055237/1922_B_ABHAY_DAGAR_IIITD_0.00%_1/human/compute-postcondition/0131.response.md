The code prints the third element of the list `results`, which is the value of `res`. The value of `res` is determined by the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is greater than or equal to 1; otherwise, `res` is 0.

Output: **the value of res (which is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise 0)**
