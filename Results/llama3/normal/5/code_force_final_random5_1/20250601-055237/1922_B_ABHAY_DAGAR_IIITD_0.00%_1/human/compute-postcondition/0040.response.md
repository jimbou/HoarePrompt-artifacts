Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from num_list and the value is the number of times that integer appears in num_list, res is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is 0, and total_count is the sum of all values in num_of_lens.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list` remain unchanged. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`. `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0. `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.
