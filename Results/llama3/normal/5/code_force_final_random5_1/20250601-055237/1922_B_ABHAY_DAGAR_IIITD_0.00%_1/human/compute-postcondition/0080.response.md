Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values().**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `results` list contains the final value of `res`, which is the sum of the products of each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` and its corresponding total count `total_count`, considering the conditions for `cnt` being greater than or equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
