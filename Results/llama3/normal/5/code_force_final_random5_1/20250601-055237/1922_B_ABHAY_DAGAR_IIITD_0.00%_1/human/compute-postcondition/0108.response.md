The only object in the loop head is variable `cnt` and dictionary `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If the dictionary has at least 2 key-value pairs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` has at least 1 key-value pair, `cnt` is the first value in the dictionary. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 2 key-value pairs and the `cnt` is the second value in the dictionary.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of unique integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the initial num_list and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `total_count` is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values() plus the first value in the dictionary, `results` has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is defined, `res` is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), `cnt` is the second value in the dictionary and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count**
