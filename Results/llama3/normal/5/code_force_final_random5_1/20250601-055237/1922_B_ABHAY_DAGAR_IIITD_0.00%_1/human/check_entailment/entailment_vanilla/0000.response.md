Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each stick length, and then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks based on these frequencies.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and calls the function func_1(t).
2. The function func_1 iterates over each test case, reading the number of sticks (n) and the list of stick lengths (num_list).
3. It creates a dictionary (num_of_lens) to store the frequency of each stick length.
4. It iterates over the stick lengths, updating the frequency count in the dictionary.
5. It initializes two variables: res (to store the total count of ways to choose 3 sticks) and total_count (to store the total count of sticks).
6. It iterates over the frequency counts in the dictionary. For each count:
   - If the count is 3 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula (cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6) and adds it to res.
   - If the count is 2 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using the combination formula (cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count) and adds it to res.
   - It updates the total_count by adding the current frequency count.
7. It appends the total count (res) to the results list.
8. Finally, it prints each result in the results list.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
