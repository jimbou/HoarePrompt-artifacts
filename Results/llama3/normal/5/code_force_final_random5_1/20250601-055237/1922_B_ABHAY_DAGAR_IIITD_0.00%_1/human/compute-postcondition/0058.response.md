Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer, and total_count is the sum of all values in num_of_lens.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain all the unique integers from the `num_list` as keys, with their corresponding counts as values. The `total_count` variable will be the sum of all these counts. The `res` variable will be greater than or equal to 1 if any of the counts in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise it will be 0. The other variables, `test_cases` and `n`, remain unchanged.
