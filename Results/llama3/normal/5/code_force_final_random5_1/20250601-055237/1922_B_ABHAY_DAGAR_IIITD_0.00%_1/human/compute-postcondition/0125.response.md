The code prints the first element in the list `results`.
Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the first element in the list `results`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first element in the list `results`.
Output: **the first element in the list results (which is the value of res)**
