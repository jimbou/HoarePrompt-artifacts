Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`. If the value of one of the key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6, where `cnt` is the value of one of the key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` and `total_count` is a variable that has been used in the expression.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated. Specifically, if any of the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary are greater than or equal to 3, `res` has been increased by the product of that value, the value minus 1, and the value minus 2, all divided by 6, and also multiplied by `total_count`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
