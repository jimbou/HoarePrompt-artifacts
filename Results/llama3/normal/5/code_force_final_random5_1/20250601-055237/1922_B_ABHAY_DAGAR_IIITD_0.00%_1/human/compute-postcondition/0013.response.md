Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in `num_list` and the value is 1. In both cases, stdin contains no input.***
