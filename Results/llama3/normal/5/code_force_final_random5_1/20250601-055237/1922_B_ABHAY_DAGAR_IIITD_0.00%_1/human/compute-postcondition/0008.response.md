Postcondition: ***test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains no input, and x is the first integer in the list. If x is already a key in the num_of_lens dictionary, the value associated with x is incremented by 1. Otherwise, x is added as a key to the num_of_lens dictionary with a value of 1.***
