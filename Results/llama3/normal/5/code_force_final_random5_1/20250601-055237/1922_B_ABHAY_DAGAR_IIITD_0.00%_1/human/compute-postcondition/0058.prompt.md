Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, res is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is 0, and total_count is the sum of all values in num_of_lens.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer. If the first integer in num_list (x) is already a key in num_of_lens, then the value of x in num_of_lens is increased by 1 and total_count is the sum of all values in num_of_lens plus 1. If the first integer in num_list (x) is not a key in num_of_lens, then x is added as a key in num_of_lens with a value of 1 and total_count is 1. In both cases, res is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 2 integers. If x is in num_of_lens, then num_of_lens[x] is increased by 1. Otherwise, num_of_lens[x] is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1 if `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, otherwise `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
