Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `num_of_lens[x]` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been updated to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `num_of_lens[x]` is now guaranteed to be 1, even if `x` was not previously in the dictionary.
