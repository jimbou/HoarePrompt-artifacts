Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i <= n, `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is that the `test_cases` variable remains unchanged, and a new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list. The `test_cases` variable still contains a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, with the same constraints as before. The `results` variable is a new empty list, waiting to be populated with results.
