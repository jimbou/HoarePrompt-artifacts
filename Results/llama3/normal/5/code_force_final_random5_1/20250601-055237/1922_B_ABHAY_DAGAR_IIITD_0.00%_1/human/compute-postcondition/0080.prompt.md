Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res which is 0, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer, and total_count is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `cnt` is the value of the first key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 2, `total_count` is `cnt`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 2, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt) + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt) + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt) + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt) + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt + cnt)`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 2, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt + cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
