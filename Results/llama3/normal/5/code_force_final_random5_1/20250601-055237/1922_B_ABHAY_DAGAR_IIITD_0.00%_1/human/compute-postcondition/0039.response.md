Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`. If the value of one of the key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6, where `cnt` is the value of one of the key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` and `total_count` is a variable that has been used in the expression and is increased by `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made to `res`.**

In this output state, the value of `total_count` has been increased by `cnt`, which is the value of one of the key-value pairs in `num_of_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for increasing `res` is still valid, and if the value of one of the key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` will be increased accordingly.
