#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i <= n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the number of triplets and pairs that can be formed from a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of times a particular number appears in the list. The function takes no input parameters and returns no value. It reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. The function performs the following actions: 

1. Reads the number of test cases from the user.
2. For each test case, reads the number of integers in the list and the list of integers.
3. Counts the occurrences of each integer in the list.
4. Calculates the number of triplets that can be formed from the list, where a triplet is a combination of three integers that appear at least three times in the list.
5. Calculates the number of pairs that can be formed from the list, where a pair is a combination of two integers that appear at least twice in the list.
6. Prints the total number of triplets and pairs for each test case.

The function modifies the state of the program by reading input from the user, processing it, and printing the results. The final state of the program is that the input lists are empty, and the results have been printed.
