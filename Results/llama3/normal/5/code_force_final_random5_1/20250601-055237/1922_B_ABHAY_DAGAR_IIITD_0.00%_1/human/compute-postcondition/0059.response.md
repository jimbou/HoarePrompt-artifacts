Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res which is 0, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer, and total_count is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign new values to existing variables. The first line sets the value of `res` to 0, which is then included in the `results` list. The second line sets the value of `total_count` to 0. 

The initial state's information about `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` remains valid as these variables are not modified by the code. The only changes are the updated values of `res` and `total_count`, which are now 0.
