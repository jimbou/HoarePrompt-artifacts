Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of results now contains the value of `res`, which is 1 if any number appears at least three times in `num_list`, and 0 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
