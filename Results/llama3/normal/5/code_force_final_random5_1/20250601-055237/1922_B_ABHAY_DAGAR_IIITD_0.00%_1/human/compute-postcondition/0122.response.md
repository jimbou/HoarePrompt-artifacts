Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of unique integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the initial `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least `len(num_of_lens)` key-value pairs, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` plus the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is defined. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with one additional element appended to the `results` list, which is the calculated value of `res` based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
