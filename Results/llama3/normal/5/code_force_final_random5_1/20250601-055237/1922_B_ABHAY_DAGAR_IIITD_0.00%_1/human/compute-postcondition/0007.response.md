Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, num_of_lens is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and 1 as its value, stdin contains no input, and x is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the code has added a new key-value pair to the `num_of_lens` dictionary, where the key is the first integer in the `num_list` (denoted by `x`) and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `test_cases` list still has at least one test case, the `results` list is still empty, the `n` integer remains the same, the `num_list` list still has at least one integer, and the `stdin` contains no input. The value of `x` is still the first integer in the `num_list`.
