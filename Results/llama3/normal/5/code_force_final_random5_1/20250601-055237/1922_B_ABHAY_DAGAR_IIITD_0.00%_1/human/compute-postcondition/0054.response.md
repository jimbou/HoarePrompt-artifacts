To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for x in num_list:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `x` and `num_list`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_list` has at least 2 integers, and `x` is the second integer in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1.**
