Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, results, and the list of integers from stdin are still present, but their values have not been modified by the code.
