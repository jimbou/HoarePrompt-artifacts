Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of unique integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the initial num_list and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `total_count` is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values() plus the first value in the dictionary plus cnt, `results` has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is defined. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**
