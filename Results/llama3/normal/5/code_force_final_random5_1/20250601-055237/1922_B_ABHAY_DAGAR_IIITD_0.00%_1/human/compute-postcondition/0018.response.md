Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, stdin contains no input, and num_of_lens is a dictionary where each key is an integer from num_list and the value is the number of times that integer appears in num_list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is that `test_cases` and `n` remain unchanged, `num_list` is empty because all its elements have been processed, `stdin` still contains no input, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`.
