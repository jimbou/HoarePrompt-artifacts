Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, stdin contains no input, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each key is an integer from num_list and the value is the number of times that integer appears in num_list, res is 0, total_count is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `res` and `total_count`, and assigns them the value 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
