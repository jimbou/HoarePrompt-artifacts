Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in `num_list` and the value is 1, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial variables remain unchanged except for `num_of_lens`, which is now a dictionary with the second integer in `num_list` as the key and the value 1. The stdin still contains no input.
