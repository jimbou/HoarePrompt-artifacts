Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count. `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of unique integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the initial num_list and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `total_count` is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values() plus the first value in the dictionary, `results` has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is defined, `res` has been increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases remains unchanged. The list of results has been updated by adding the product of the count of each integer, the count minus one, and the total count, divided by two, to the result for each count in the dictionary of counts. The integer n, the list of unique integers, the dictionary of counts, and the total count remain unchanged. The results list has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop. The underscore variable remains 1, the standard input is empty, and the variable x is still defined. The result has been increased by the product of the count, the count minus one, and the total count, divided by two.
