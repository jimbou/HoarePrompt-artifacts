To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be greater than 1.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.**
