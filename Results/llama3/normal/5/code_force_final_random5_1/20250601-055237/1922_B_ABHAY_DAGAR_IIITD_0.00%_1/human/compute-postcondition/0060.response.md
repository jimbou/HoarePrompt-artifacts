According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens dictionary. If the dictionary has at least 1 key-value pair, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res which is 0, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer, and total_count is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the dictionary must have at least 1 key-value pair and cnt is the value of the first key-value pair.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res which is 0, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 1 key-value pair, cnt is the value of the first key-value pair, total_count is 0**
