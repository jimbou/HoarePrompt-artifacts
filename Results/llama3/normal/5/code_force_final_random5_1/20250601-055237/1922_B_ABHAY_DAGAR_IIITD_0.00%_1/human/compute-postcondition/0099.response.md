Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the initial num_list and the values are the counts of each integer, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), results has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is not defined, res is 0, total_count is 0**

The code initializes two variables, `res` and `total_count`, to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
