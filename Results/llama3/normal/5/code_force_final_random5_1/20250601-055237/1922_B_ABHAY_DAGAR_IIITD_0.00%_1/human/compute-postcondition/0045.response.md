Postcondition: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the first integer in num_list (x) is a key, res is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is 0, total_count is the sum of all values in num_of_lens, and the current value of x is a key in num_of_lens.**
