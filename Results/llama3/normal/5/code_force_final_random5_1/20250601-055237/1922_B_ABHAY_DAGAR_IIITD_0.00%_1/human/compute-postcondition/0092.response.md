Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` has one more element appended to it, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the second integer in the list, `num_of_lens` has one more key-value pair where `x` is the key and 1 is the value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code adds a new key-value pair to the `num_of_lens` dictionary where the key is `x` (the second integer in the list) and the value is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
