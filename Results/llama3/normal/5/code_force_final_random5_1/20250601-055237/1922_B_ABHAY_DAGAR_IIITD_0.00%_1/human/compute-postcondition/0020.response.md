To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least one value, the loop will execute. 

Since `num_list` is empty, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute. Also, `cnt` will take the value of the first value in `num_of_lens` at the start of the loop.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`**
