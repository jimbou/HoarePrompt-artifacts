Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, and `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `num_of_lens[x]`, which has been incremented by 1. The value of `x` is still the second integer in the list `num_list`.
