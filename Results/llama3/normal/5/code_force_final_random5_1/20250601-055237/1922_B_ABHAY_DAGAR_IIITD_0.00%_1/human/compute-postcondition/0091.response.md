Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values() plus 1 if x is in num_of_lens, otherwise total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), results has one more element appended to it, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is the second integer in the list, num_of_lens[x] is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The test cases list remains unchanged. The results list still contains the calculated value of res, which depends on the counts of each integer in num_list. The value of n remains the same. The num_list still contains at least 2 integers. The num_of_lens dictionary has been updated to reflect the increased count of the integer x. The total_count has been updated accordingly. The results list has one more element appended to it. The value of _ remains 1. The stdin is still empty. The value of x is still the second integer in the list. The count of x in num_of_lens has been increased by 1.
