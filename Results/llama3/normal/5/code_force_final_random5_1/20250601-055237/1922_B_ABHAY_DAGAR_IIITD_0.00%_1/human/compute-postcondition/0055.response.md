Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1 and `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1.**

The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1. The value of `x` is the third integer in the list `num_list`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
