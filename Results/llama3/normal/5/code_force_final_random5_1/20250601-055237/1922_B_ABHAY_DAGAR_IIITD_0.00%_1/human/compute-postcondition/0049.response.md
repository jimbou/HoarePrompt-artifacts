Postcondition: ***test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer. If the first integer in num_list (x) is already a key in num_of_lens, then the value of x in num_of_lens is increased by 1 and total_count is the sum of all values in num_of_lens plus 1. If the first integer in num_list (x) is not a key in num_of_lens, then x is added as a key in num_of_lens with a value of 1 and total_count is 1. In both cases, res is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is 0.***
