According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens. If the dictionary has at least 1 key-value pair, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, results has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop, res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), num_list is a list of unique integers, and x is defined. So for the loop to be executed, the dictionary must have at least 1 key-value pair and cnt is the first value in the dictionary.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of unique integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the initial num_list and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `total_count` is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), `results` has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is defined, `res` is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), `total_count` is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), `cnt` is the first value in the dictionary**
