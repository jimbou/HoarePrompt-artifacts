To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values():`, which means we are iterating over the values of the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `num_of_lens` has at least 2 key-value pairs, and `cnt` is the value of the second key-value pair, which is greater than or equal to 2.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. Specifically, we need to consider the `num_of_lens` dictionary and its values.

Since we are iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, we need to ensure that there is at least one more value to iterate over. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `num_of_lens` to have at least 3 key-value pairs.

Additionally, since `cnt` is the value of the second key-value pair, we can adjust its value to be the value of the third key-value pair.

The other variables, such as `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 2, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`**
