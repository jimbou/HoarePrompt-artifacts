Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` times `cnt-2` divided by 6 if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0 plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` times `cnt-2` divided by 6, and `total_count` is `cnt` plus its previous value. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to be `res` plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` divided by 2 times `total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is `cnt` plus its previous value. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to be `res` plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` divided by 2 times `total_count`.***
