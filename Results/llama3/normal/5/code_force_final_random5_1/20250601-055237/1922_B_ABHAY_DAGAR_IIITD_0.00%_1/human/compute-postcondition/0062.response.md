Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res which is cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in num_list and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 1 key-value pair, cnt is the value of the first key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 3, total_count is 0**

The value of `res` is updated by adding the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2`, divided by 6. The value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, so the new value of `res` is a positive integer. The values of the other variables are not affected.
