Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` that must have at least 1 element, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and the first element in the list `results` which is `res` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and the second element in the list `results` which is `result` is being printed, and the value of `result` which is the second element of the list `results` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and the third element in the list `results` which is `result` is being printed, and the value of `result` which is the third element of the list `results` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
