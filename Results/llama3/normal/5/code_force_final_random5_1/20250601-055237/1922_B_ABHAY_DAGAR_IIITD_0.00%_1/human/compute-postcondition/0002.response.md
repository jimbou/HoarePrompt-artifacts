Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no input.**

The code executes as follows:

1. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer, its value is now set to the input value. 
2. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `num_list`. Since `num_list` is a list of integers, its value is now set to the list of integers from the input. 
3. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, its value remains unchanged.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of any variables that are modified by the code. The output state includes the state of all the variables after the execution of the code snippet.
