Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is the third integer in `num_list` and the value is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens` has been updated to be a dictionary where the key is the third integer in `num_list` and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `num_of_lens` is now guaranteed to have at least one key-value pair, where the key is the third integer in `num_list` and the value is 1.
