The only object in the loop head is variable  cnt and num_of_lens, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the num_of_lens has at least 2 key-value pairs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, num_of_lens has at least 1 key-value pair, cnt is the value of the first key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 2, total_count is cnt. So for the loop to be executed one more time the num_of_lens must have at least 2 key-value pairs and the cnt is the value of the second key-value pair and total_count is cnt.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 2, `total_count` is `cnt`**
