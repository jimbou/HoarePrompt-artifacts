Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer in the list and is a key in the `num_of_lens` dictionary, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `num_of_lens` still contains at least one key-value pair, with the key being `x` and the value being the incremented count. The rest of the variables maintain their initial properties, with `test_cases` having at least one test case, `results` being empty, `n` being an integer, `num_list` having at least one integer, and `x` being the first integer in the list and a key in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.
