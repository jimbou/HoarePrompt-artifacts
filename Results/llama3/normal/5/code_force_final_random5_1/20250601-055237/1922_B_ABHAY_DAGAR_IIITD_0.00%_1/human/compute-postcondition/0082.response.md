The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be greater than 1 and `_` is 1.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `results` has one more element appended to it, `_` is 1**
