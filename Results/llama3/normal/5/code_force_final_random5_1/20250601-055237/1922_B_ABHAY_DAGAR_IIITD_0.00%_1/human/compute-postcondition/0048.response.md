Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1, `res` is 0 since no value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `total_count` is 1, and `x` is the first integer in `num_list`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases remains unchanged, the results list still contains the value of res, the integer n from stdin remains the same, the list of integers from stdin still has at least one integer, the dictionary num_of_lens now has the first integer x from num_list as a key with a value of 1, the value of res is 0 since no value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, the total count is 1, and x is still the first integer in num_list.
