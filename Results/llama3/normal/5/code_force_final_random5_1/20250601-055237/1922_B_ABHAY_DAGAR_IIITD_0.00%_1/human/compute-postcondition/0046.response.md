Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the first integer in num_list (x) is a key and its value is increased by 1, res is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in num_of_lens is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is 0, total_count is the sum of all values in num_of_lens plus 1, and the current value of x is a key in num_of_lens.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1, which means the count of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` has been increased by 1. The value of `total_count` has also been updated to reflect the new count, by adding 1 to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
