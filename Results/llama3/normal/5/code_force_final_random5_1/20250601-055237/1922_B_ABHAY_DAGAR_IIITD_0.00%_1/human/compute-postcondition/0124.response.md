According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`. So for the loop to be executed, the list `results` must have at least 1 element and `result` is the first element in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` that must have at least 1 element, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `result` is the first element in the list**
