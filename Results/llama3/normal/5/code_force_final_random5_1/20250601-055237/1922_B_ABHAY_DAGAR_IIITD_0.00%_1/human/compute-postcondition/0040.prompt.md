Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, stdin contains no input, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each key is an integer from num_list and the value is the number of times that integer appears in num_list, res is 0, total_count is 0
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is `cnt` plus its previous value. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to be `res` plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` divided by 2 times `total_count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` times `cnt-2` divided by 6 if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0 plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` times `cnt-2` divided by 6, and `total_count` is `cnt` plus its previous value plus `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to be `res` plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` divided by 2 times `total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is `cnt` plus its previous value plus `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to be `res` plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` divided by 2 times `total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` and `total_count` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`. If the value of one of the key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6, where `cnt` is the value of one of the key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` and `total_count` is a variable that has been used in the expression and is increased by `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made to `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
