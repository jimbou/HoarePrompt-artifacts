The only object in the loop head is variable  cnt and dictionary num_of_lens, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the dictionary has at least 3 key-value pairs the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, num_of_lens has at least 2 key-value pairs. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 3 key-value pairs.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`.**
