Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of res, n is an integer from stdin, num_list is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 2 integers, num_of_lens[x] is 1**

The code assigns the value 1 to num_of_lens[x], where x is not specified in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected. The test_cases list still contains at least 2 test cases, the results list still contains the value of res, n is still an integer from stdin, and num_list is still a list of integers from stdin with at least 2 integers.
