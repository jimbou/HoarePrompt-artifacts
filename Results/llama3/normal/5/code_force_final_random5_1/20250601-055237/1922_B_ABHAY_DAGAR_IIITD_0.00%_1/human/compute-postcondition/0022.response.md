Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is greater than or equal to 1, and `total_count` is 0, and the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, which is the first value in `num_of_lens`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be greater than or equal to 1, as it is incremented by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6, where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
