Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the value of res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values() where cnt is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), n is an integer, num_list is a list of unique integers, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the initial num_list and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least len(num_of_lens) key-value pairs, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values() plus the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.values(), results has one more element appended to it for each iteration of the loop, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is defined. If cnt is greater than or equal to 3, res has been increased by cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 and if cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res has been increased by cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has iterated over all the values in the num_of_lens dictionary. The results list contains the final value of res, which is the sum of the products of each count and its corresponding total count, and the total count is the sum of all counts in the num_of_lens dictionary. The num_of_lens dictionary has at least len(num_of_lens) key-value pairs, and the total count is the sum of all counts in the num_of_lens dictionary plus the sum of all counts in the num_of_lens dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
