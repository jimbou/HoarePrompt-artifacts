Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program works by first counting the number of sticks of each length and then calculating the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle.

The program correctly handles the case where three sticks of the same length are chosen, as well as the case where two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length are chosen. The program also correctly calculates the total number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle by summing up the number of ways for each possible combination of stick lengths.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program seems to correctly handle all possible inputs and edge cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
