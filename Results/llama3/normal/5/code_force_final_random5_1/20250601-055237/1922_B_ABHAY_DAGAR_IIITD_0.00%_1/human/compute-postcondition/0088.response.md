Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * `total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * `total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` has one more element appended to it, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the first integer in the list, `x` is in `num_of_lens` with a count of 1, and `num_of_lens` has one more key-value pair.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, results, and the integer n remain unchanged. The list of integers and the dictionary of unique integers with their counts also remain unchanged, but the dictionary now includes the first integer in the list with a count of 1. The total count of integers in the dictionary is updated accordingly. The results list has one more element appended to it. The stdin is still empty, and the variable _ is still 1.
