Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `n` is an integer from stdin, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `num_list` and the values are the counts of each integer that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second key-value pair and is greater than or equal to 2, `total_count` is `cnt`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases remains unchanged. The list of results now contains the updated value of `res`, which is the sum of the original value of `res` and the additional term `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. The values of `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `total_count` remain unchanged.
