Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is 0. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. `res` is updated to be `res` plus `cnt` times `cnt-1` divided by 2 times `total_count`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being the update of the value of `res`. The value of `res` is increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1` divided by 2, and `total_count`. The other variables remain unchanged.
