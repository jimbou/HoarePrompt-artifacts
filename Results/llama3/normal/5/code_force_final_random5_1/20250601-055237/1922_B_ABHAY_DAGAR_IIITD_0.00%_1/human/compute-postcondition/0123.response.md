Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `res` which is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is greater than or equal to 1 if any value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `test_cases` is empty, `results` contains the final result of the calculation, `n` is the last integer input, `num_list` is empty, `num_of_lens` contains the count of each integer in the last input list, `res` is the final result of the calculation, and `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.
