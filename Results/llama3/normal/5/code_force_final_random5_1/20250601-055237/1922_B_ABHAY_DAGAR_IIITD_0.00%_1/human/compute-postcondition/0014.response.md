To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `x` and the list `num_list`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `num_list`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second integer in the list, and `num_list` has at least 2 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `num_list` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` should be the third integer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is the third integer in `num_list` and the value is 1. In both cases, stdin contains no input.**
