Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains no input, and x is the first integer in the list. If x is already a key in the num_of_lens dictionary, the value associated with x is incremented by 1. Otherwise, x is added as a key to the num_of_lens dictionary with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is the second integer in `num_list` and the value is 1. In both cases, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is the third integer in `num_list` and the value is either incremented by 1 if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, or is 1 if `x` is not a key in `num_of_lens`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
