The only object in the loop head is variable  x and list num_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_list.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, num_list has at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the x is the second integer in the list.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains no input, and x is the second integer in the list**
