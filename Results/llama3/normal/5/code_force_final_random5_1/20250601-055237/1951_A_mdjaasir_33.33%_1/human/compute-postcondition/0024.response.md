Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of length t, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2, 'YES' is printed if the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If count is less than 2 or is an odd number, 'NO' is printed.***
