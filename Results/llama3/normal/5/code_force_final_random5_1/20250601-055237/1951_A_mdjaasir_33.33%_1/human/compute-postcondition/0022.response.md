Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of length t, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and count is not equal to 0. Additionally, either count is less than or equal to 2 or count is odd. If count is 2, 'YES' is printed if the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If count is not 2, 'NO' is printed.***
