Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which is obtained from the first input in the stdin. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only has one input, which is a binary string of the same length as the value of `t`.
