Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of length t, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2, 'YES' is printed if the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If count is less than 2 or is an odd number, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, n is an integer, a is a binary string of length t, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 3 and 1000, i is 2, n is an integer, a is a binary string of length t, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
