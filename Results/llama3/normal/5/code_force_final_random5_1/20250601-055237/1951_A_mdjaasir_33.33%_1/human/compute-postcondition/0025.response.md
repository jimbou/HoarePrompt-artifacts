The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `t`, `count` is the number of '1's in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
