Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the count of '1's is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, it is impossible to reach a configuration with an odd number of '1's, but the program does not check for this case. 

For example, if the input is:

3
3
101

The program will print 'NO', but it should print 'NO' because it is impossible to reach this configuration.

The correct program should add an additional condition to check if the count of '1's is 1, and if so, print 'NO'.
