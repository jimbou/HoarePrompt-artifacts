Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 1000, i is 2, n is an integer, a is a binary string of length t, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the input from stdin. The value of `a` has been updated to the binary string input from stdin. The value of `count` has been updated to the number of '1's in the binary string `a`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
