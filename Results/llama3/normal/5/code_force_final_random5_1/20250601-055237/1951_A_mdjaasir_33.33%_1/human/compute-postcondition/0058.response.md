Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer and a binary string of the same length. It counts the number of '1's in the binary string and prints 'YES' if the count is 0, greater than 2 and even, or 2 and the first '1' is not followed by another '1'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function iterates through all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
