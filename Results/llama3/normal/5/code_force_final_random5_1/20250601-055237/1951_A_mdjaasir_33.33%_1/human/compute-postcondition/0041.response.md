The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of length `t`, `count` is the number of '1's in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `count` is 0, 'YES' is printed. If `count` is greater than 2 and `count` is even, 'YES' is printed. If `count` is 2 and the first '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
