Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, n is an integer, a is a binary string of length t, count is the number of '1's in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If count is greater than 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
