Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" (operations) required to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles.

The function first checks if the array has only one element or all elements are equal. If so, it returns 0, as no operations are needed.

If the array has more than one element and not all elements are equal, the function then finds the longest sequence of equal elements at the start and end of the array. It does this by iterating from the start and end of the array, respectively, until it finds a pair of unequal elements.

The function then returns the maximum number of elements that can be removed from the start and end of the array without removing all elements. This is done by taking the minimum of the number of elements that can be removed from the start (`n - i - 1`) and the number of elements that can be removed from the end (`j`).

The program then prints the result of the function call for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly handles the base cases where the array has only one element or all elements are equal, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal in the general case.

Correctness: **True**
