The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The first three elements of `arr` are still the same, `n` is still at least 3, and `j` is still the last index of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first three elements are the same, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `j` is the last index of `arr`.**
