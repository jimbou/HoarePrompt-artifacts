The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was the last index of `arr`, so the new value of `j` is the second last index of `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where the first `i+1` elements are the same, `i` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `arr`, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is the second last index of `arr`, and the last two elements of `arr` must be equal.
