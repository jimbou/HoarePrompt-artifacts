Output State: **arr is a list of integers where the first i+1 elements are the same, i is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of arr, n is the length of arr, j is the last index of arr.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to increment `i` as long as the current element and the next element in the array are equal. Once it finds a pair of elements that are not equal, or if it reaches the second-to-last element in the array, the loop will terminate. At this point, `i` will be equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the array, and `n` and `j` will remain unchanged.
