To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the involved variables accordingly. The loop head is:

```
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

The conditions for the loop to execute are:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`

Given the initial states:
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the length of `arr`
- `j` is the last index of `arr`

We need to adjust the states so that both conditions are met.

1. For `i < len(arr) - 1` to be true, considering `i` is 0, `len(arr)` must be at least 2. This implies `n`, which is the length of `arr`, must be at least 2.

2. For `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` to be true, given `i` is 0, `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`. This means the first two elements of `arr` must be the same.

The state of `j` (the last index of `arr`) does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute the first time, as the condition `i < len(arr) - 1` ensures that `i` does not reach the last index initially.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute the first time are:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the same, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `j` is the last index of `arr`**
