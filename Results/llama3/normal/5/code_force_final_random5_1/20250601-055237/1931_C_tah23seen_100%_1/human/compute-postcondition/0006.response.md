Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first four elements are the same, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `j` is the last index of `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The first four elements of `arr` are still the same, `n` is still at least 3, and `j` is still the last index of `arr`.
