To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `arr`, and `n`.

1. `i` is currently 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, we can adjust `n` to be at least 3 to ensure `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`.

2. `arr` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the same. For the loop to execute again, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 1, we need to ensure that the second and third elements of `arr` are the same.

3. `j` is the last index of `arr`, but it is not used in the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first three elements are the same, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `j` is the last index of `arr`**
