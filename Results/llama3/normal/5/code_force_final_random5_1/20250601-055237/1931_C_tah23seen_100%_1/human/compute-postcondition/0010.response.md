According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr`. If `j` is greater than 0 and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the second last index of `arr`, and the last two elements of `arr` must be equal. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than 0, and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`. Since `j` is the second last index of `arr`, `j` must be greater than 1. Also, since the last two elements of `arr` must be equal, `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`. Therefore, the states of `j` and `arr` need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first `i+1` elements are the same, `i` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `arr`, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` must be greater than 1, and the last three elements of `arr` must be equal**
