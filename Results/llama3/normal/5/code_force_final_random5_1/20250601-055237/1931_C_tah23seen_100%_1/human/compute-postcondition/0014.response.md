Output State: **arr is a list of integers where the first i+1 elements are the same, i is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of arr, n is greater than 1, and all elements of arr are equal, j is -1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the list `arr` will have all its elements equal, and the variable `j` will be -1. The number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `arr`, `i`, and the length of `arr`, `n`, remain unchanged.
