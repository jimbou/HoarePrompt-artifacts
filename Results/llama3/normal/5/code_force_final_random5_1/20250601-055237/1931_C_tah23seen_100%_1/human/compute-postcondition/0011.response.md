Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first `i+1` elements are the same, `i` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `arr`, `n` is greater than 1, and the last three elements of `arr` are equal, `j` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and the properties of `arr` are still valid.
