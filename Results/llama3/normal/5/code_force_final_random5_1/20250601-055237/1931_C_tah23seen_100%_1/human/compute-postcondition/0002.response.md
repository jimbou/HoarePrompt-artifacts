Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first two elements are the same, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is the last index of `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has the same properties as before, with the first two elements being the same. The value of `n` is still at least 2, and `j` is still the last index of `arr`.
