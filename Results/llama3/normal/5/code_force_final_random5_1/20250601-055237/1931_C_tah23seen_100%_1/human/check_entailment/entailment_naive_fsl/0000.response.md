Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The program will return 4, but the correct answer is 3. This is because the program only checks for the longest sequence of equal elements from the start and end of the array, but it does not consider the case where the longest sequence is in the middle of the array.

The program should be modified to find the longest sequence of equal elements in the entire array, not just from the start and end. This can be done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the longest sequence found so far.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    max_len = 0
    max_val = arr[0]
    curr_len = 1
    curr_val = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] == curr_val:
            curr_len += 1
        else:
            if curr_len > max_len:
                max_len = curr_len
                max_val = curr_val
            curr_len = 1
            curr_val = arr[i]
    
    if curr_len > max_len:
        max_len = curr_len
        max_val = curr_val
    
    return n - max_len
```

This corrected program iterates through the array, keeping track of the longest sequence of equal elements found so far. It then returns the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal, which is the length of the array minus the length of the longest sequence.
