Output State: **arr is a list of integers, i is 0, n is the length of arr, j is the last index of arr**

The code initializes three variables: `i`, `n`, and `j`. The first line sets `i` to 0. The second line assigns the length of the list `arr` to `n`. The third line assigns the last index of the list `arr` to `j`. Since the length of a list is one more than its last index, `n` is one more than `j`. The list `arr` remains unchanged.
