Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" required to make all elements of an array equal. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function `func_1` works by first finding the longest prefix and suffix of the array that have the same element. It does this by iterating from the start and end of the array, respectively, until it finds a pair of elements that are different.

If the first and last elements of the array are the same, the function returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and 0, where `i` and `j` are the indices of the first and last elements of the prefix and suffix, respectively. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, we can make all elements equal by replacing the elements in the middle of the array.

If the first and last elements are not the same, the function returns the maximum of `n - i - 1` and `j`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because if the first and last elements are different, we need to replace all elements in the array except for the prefix and suffix.

However, there is a logical error in the function. The function does not correctly handle the case where the first and last elements are different. In this case, the function should return the minimum of `n - i - 1` and `j`, not the maximum. This is because we want to replace the minimum number of elements required to make all elements equal.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
