Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first `i+1` elements are the same, `i` is the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of `arr`, `n` is greater than 1, and the last three elements of `arr` are equal, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and is one less than its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to 0. The other variables, including `arr`, `i`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
