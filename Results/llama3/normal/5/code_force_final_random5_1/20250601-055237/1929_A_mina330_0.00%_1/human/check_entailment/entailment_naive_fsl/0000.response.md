Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. It first sorts the array in ascending order, then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized, as the largest elements are paired with the smallest elements, resulting in the maximum possible differences.

The program also correctly handles the case where the length of the array is even, by only iterating up to the middle of the array. This is because the beauty is calculated by summing the differences between pairs of elements, and when the length of the array is even, the middle elements are paired with each other, resulting in a difference of 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same, by returning a beauty of 0. This is because the beauty is calculated by summing the differences between elements, and when all elements are the same, all differences are 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array, and handles all possible cases correctly.
