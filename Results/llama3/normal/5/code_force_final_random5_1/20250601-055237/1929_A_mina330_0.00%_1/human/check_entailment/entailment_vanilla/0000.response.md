Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.

4. The program then sorts the array in ascending order.

5. The program calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, until it reaches the middle of the array.

6. The program prints the calculated maximum beauty for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The calculation of the maximum beauty is incorrect. The correct calculation should be the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
