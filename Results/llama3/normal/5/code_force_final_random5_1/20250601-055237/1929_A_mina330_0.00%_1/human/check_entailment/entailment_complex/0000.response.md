Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of the differences between the elements at the corresponding indices from the end and the start of the list, and prints this sum for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It sorts the array in ascending order, which ensures that the differences between the elements at the corresponding indices from the end and the start of the list are maximized. The program then calculates the sum of these differences, which represents the maximum beauty of the array.

The program also correctly handles the input and output operations. It reads the number of test cases and the input for each test case from standard input, and prints the result for each test case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
