Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 * (len(a) // 2 + 1) elements, `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2 + 1) - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 + 1]`, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is `len(a) // 2 + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: `ntest` remains an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `itest` remains 3, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 * (len(a) // 2 + 1) elements, `kq` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - (len(a) // 2 + 1) - 1` and the element at index `len(a) // 2 + 1` in the list `a`, `stdin` still contains t-4 test cases, and `i` remains `len(a) // 2 + 1`.
