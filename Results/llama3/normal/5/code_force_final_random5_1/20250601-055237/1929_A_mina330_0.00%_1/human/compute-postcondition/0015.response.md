Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `kq` has been updated to be the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
