To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `a`, and the implicit `range` object defined by `0`, `len(a) // 2`, and `1`.

1. `i` is already defined as `len(a) // 2 - 1`, which is a valid starting point for the loop.
2. `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers with at least 2 elements. Since `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive, `len(a)` is also between 2 and 100 inclusive. To ensure the loop executes, `len(a) // 2` must be greater than 0, which means `len(a)` must be at least 2. This condition is already satisfied by the given state.
3. The `range` object is defined by `0`, `len(a) // 2`, and `1`. To ensure the loop executes, `len(a) // 2` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given state.

Since the loop head only depends on `i` and `a`, we don't need to adjust the states of `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, `kq`, or `stdin`.

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is 0, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`**
