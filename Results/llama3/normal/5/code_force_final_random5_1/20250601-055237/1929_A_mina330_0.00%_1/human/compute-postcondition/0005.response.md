To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the step size is 1), and `a` must still have at least 2 elements.

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 1**
