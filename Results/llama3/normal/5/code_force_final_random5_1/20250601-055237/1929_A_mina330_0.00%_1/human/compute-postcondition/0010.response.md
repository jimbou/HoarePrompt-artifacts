The code prints the value of `kq`, which is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list `a` will be calculated and summed up.

Output: **the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list a**
