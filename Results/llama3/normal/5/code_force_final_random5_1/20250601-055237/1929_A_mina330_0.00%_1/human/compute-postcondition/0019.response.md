Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 4 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `kq` has been updated by adding the difference between the third last element and the third element of the list `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
