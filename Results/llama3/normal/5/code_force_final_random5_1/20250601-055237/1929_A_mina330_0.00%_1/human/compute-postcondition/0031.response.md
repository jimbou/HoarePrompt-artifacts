Output State: **ntest is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, itest is 3, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, kq is the sum of the differences between the elements at the corresponding indices from the end and the start of the list a, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is len(a) // 2 - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, `stdin` remain unchanged, `a` is still a sorted list of `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the elements at the corresponding indices from the end and the start of the list `a`, and `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
