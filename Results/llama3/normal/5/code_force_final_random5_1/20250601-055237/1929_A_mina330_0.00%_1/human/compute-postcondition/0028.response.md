Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) // 2] - a[len(a) // 2]`, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is `len(a) // 2`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `kq` has been updated by adding the difference between the middle element and the middle element of the sorted list `a` (which is essentially adding 0), and all other variables remain unchanged.
