Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between the elements at the corresponding indices from the end and the start of the list. This approach is correct because it maximizes the beauty of the array by placing the largest elements at the end and the smallest elements at the start.

The program correctly handles the case where the array has an even number of elements by iterating over the first half of the array and calculating the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements. In this case, the middle element is not included in the calculation, which is correct because the beauty of the array is not affected by the middle element when the array has an odd number of elements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
