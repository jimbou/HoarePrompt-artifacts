Output State: **ntest is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, itest is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, kq is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list a, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is len(a) // 2 - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ntest` remains an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `itest` remains 1, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list `a`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, and `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
