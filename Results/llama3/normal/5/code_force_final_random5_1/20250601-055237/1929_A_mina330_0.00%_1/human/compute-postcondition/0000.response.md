Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `ntest` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of the other variables are not affected.
