Output: **ntest is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, itest is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, kq is the sum of a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i] for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1), stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is len(a) // 2 - 1, and the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list a, which is kq, is being printed**
