To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `ntest`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `itest` is less than `ntest`. At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 1, and `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

To execute the loop again, `itest` needs to be incremented by 1, so `itest` becomes 2. The value of `ntest` remains the same.

The other variables, such as `n`, `a`, `kq`, `stdin`, and `i`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list `a`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`**
