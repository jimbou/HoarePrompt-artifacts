Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of the differences between the elements at the corresponding indices from the end and the start of the list, and prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases provided in the input and does not return any value.**
