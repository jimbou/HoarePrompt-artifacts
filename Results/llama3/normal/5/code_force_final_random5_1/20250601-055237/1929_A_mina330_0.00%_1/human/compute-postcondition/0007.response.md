To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `a` still needs to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is 2 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 2**
