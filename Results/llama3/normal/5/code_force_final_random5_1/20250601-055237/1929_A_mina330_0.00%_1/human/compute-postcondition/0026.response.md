Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `kq` has been updated by adding the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i` in the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
