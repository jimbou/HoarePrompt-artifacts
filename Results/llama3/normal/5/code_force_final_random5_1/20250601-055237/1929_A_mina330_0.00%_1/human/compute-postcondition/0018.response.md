To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `a` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `a` is still at least 2, but since `i` is now 2, `a` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 4 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1]`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2**
