Output State: **ntest is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, itest is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, kq is the sum of a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i] for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1), stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is len(a) // 2 - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of kq. The value of kq is now the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the list a, for all pairs of elements that are equidistant from the ends of the list. The value of i is now the last index of the loop, which is len(a) // 2 - 1.
