Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `kq` has been updated to be the difference between the last element of the list `a` and the first element of the list `a`, since `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
