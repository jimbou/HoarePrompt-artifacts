Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `0`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k` and the rest are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k > 0`, otherwise the list remains unchanged, and `k` is reduced by the value of each element in `nums` if `k > 0`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains a positive integer, `i` remains `n - 1`, `k` remains `0`, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is increased by `k`, and the rest of the elements remain the same as before. The value of `k` is still `0`, and the list `nums` has been modified only at the first element.
