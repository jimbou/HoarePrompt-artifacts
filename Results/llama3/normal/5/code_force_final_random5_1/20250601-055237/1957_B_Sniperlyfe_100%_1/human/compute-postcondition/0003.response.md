Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, k is a positive integer less than its original value and greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are 0, except for the second element which is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k), k is reduced by the value of the second element in nums**
