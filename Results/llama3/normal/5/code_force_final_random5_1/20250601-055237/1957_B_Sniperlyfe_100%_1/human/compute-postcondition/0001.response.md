To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

The variable `i` is initialized to 1, so we can set its state to 1.

The other variables, `k` and `nums`, are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states. However, we can infer that `k` is still a positive integer less than its original value, and `nums` is still a list of `n` integers with the first element being `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest being 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer less than its original value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are 0**
