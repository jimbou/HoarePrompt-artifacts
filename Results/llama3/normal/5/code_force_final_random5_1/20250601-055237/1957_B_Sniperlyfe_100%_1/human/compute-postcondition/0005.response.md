The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is at least 3, i is 2, k is a positive integer less than its original value, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are 0, except for the second element which is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k) if k > 0, otherwise the list remains unchanged, k is reduced by the value of the second element in nums if k > 0**
