Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, i is 1, k is a positive integer less than its original value, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are 0, except for the second element which is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k) if k > 0, otherwise the list remains unchanged, k is reduced by the value of the second element in nums if k > 0***
