#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that n <= k.
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, i is n - 1, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are min(nums[0] + 1, k) if k > 0, otherwise the list remains unchanged, and k is reduced by the value of each element in nums if k > 0, otherwise k remains unchanged.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k and the rest are min(nums[0] + 1, k) if k > 0, otherwise the list remains unchanged, and k is reduced by the value of each element in nums if k > 0, otherwise k remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of n integers based on the input parameters n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a positive integer greater than or equal to n. The function initializes the list with the first element being the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits minus 1, and then iteratively fills the rest of the list with the minimum value between the first element plus 1 and the remaining value of k. If k becomes 0, the function stops filling the list. Finally, the function adds the remaining value of k to the first element of the list and returns the list.
