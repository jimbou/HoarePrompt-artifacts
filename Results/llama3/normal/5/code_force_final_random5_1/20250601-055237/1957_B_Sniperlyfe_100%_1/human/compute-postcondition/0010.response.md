Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, i is 3, k is a positive integer less than its original value, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, the second element is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k) if k > 0, otherwise the list remains unchanged, the third element is min(nums[0] + 1, k) if k > 0, otherwise the list remains unchanged, and the fourth element is min(nums[0] + 1, k) if k > 0, otherwise the list remains unchanged, and k is reduced by the value of the fourth element in nums if k > 0, otherwise k remains unchanged.***
