Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is n - 1, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are min(nums[0] + 1, k) if k > 0, otherwise the list remains unchanged, and k is reduced by the value of each element in nums if k > 0, otherwise k remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the end of the loop, `k` has been reduced to 0, and the list `nums` has been filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k` for each element, if `k` is greater than 0. If `k` is 0, the list remains unchanged. The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
