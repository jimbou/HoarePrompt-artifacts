To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), we can confirm that the loop will indeed execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the first value in the range generated by `range(t)`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), `i` is 0**
