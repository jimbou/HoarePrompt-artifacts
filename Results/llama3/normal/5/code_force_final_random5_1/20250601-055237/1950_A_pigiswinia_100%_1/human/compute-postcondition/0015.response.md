To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `i` has incremented, the condition `i < t` must still be true for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
