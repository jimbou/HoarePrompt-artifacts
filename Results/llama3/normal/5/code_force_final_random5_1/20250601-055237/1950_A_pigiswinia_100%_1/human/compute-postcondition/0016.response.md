Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, `c` are the first line of the input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to be the first line of the input, which contains three digits between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still valid.
