Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not satisfy the condition (a < b < c), meaning either a is not less than b, or b is not less than c, or both. Additionally, the current value of `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.**
