Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c) and prints the corresponding output. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The program handles all possible cases, including when the digits are equal, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
