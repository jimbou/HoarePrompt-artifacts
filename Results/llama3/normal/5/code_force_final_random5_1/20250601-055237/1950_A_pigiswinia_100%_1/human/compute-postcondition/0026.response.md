Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, `c` are the second line of the input, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to be the integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) from the second line of the input. The stdin now contains t-5 lines, each containing three digits. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still valid, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated.
