Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), but since one line has been read from stdin, the number of lines remaining in stdin is `t-1`. The value of `i` remains 0. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the three digits read from the first line of stdin, which are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
