Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, `c` are the last line of the input, stdin is empty. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `t`, which represents the number of lines in the input. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values of the last line of the input. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all lines have been processed. The loop will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each line of the input, depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
