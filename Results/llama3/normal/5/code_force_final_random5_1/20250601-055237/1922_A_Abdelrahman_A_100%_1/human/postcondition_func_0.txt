This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. It then checks each test case to see if string c can be formed by taking one character from either string a or string b at each corresponding index. If string c can be formed in this way, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
