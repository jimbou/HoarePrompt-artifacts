Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input value, `counter` is 0, stdin contains tests - 5 inputs, `no` is True
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input value that must not be empty, `counter` is 1, stdin contains tests - 5 inputs. If the first character of `c` is not in the current character of `a` and `b`, then `no` is set to False, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input value that must have at least 2 characters and the first character is not empty, `counter` is 2, stdin contains tests - 6 inputs, x is the second character in the string c. If x is not in a[counter] and x is not in b[counter], then 'YES' is printed, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input value that must have at least 3 characters and the first character is not empty, `counter` is 3, stdin contains tests - 6 inputs, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
