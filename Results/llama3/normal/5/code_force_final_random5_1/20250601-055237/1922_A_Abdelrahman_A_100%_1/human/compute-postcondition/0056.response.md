Postcondition: ***`tests` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input value that must have at least 2 characters and the first character is not empty, `counter` is 1, stdin contains tests - 6 inputs, x is the second character in the string c. If x is not in a[counter] and x is not in b[counter], then 'YES' is printed, `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
