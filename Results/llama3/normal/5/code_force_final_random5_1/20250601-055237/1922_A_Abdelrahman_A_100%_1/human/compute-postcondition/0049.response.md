Postcondition: ***`tests` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input value that must not be empty, `counter` is 0, stdin contains tests - 5 inputs. If the first character of `c` is not in the current character of `a` and `b`, then `no` is set to False, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
