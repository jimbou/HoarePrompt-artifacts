Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the first input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, then `no` is False and 'NO' is being printed. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, then `c` is an empty string, `counter` is equal to the length of string `c`, `stdin` contains `tests - (9 + length of string `c`)` inputs, and `x` is the last character in string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False, 'YES' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
