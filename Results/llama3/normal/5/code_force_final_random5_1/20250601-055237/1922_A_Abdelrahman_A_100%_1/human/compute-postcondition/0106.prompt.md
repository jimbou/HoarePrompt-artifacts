Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        counter = 0
        for x in c:
            if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                no = False
                print('YES')
                break
            counter += 1
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tests is greater than 0, i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains tests - 1 inputs. If c is equal to a or b, then 'NO' is printed and no is False. If c is not equal to a or b, then c must have at least as many characters as slength, counter is equal to slength, and no is False if any character in c is not present in the corresponding index of a and b, otherwise no is True. If no is True, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: tests is greater than 1, i is 1, slength is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the second input value, b is a string equal to the third input value, c is a string equal to the fourth input value, stdin contains tests - 5 inputs. If c is equal to a or b, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if c has at least as many characters as slength and all characters in c are in the corresponding characters of a and b, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the first input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, then `no` is False and 'NO' is being printed. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, then `c` is an empty string, `counter` is equal to the length of string `c`, `stdin` contains `tests - (9 + length of string `c`)` inputs, and `x` is the last character in string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False, 'YES' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `no` is True, then the current value of `no` is True, and the current value of `x` is in `a[counter]` or `x` is in `b[counter]`, and 'NO' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
