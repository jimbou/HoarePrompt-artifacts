The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `tests`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `tests`. If `i` is less than `tests`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `tests` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `tests` must be greater than 2.
State: **`tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input value, `stdin` contains `tests` - 5 inputs**
