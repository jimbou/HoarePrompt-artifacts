Postcondition: ***`tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the first input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input value, `no` is True, `counter` is 0, stdin contains tests - 9 inputs, `x` is the first character in string `c`. The current value of `x` is not present in the current value of `a[counter]` and not present in the current value of `b[counter]`***
