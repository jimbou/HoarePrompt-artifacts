Output: **`tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the first input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, then the current value of `no` is True. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, then `c` is an empty string, `counter` is equal to the length of string `c`, `stdin` contains `tests - (9 + length of string `c`)` inputs, and `x` is the last character in string `c`. The current value of `no` is True, and the current value of `x` is in `a[counter]` or `x` is in `b[counter]`, and 'NO' is being printed**
