Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the first input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input value, `no` is True, `counter` is 0, stdin contains tests - 9 inputs
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the first input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input value, `counter` is 1, stdin contains tests - 10 inputs, `x` is the first character in string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the first input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input value, `counter` is 2, `stdin` contains tests - 10 inputs, `x` is the second character in string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False, 'YES' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the first input value, `a` is a string equal to the second input value, `b` is a string equal to the third input value, `c` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input value, `counter` is 3, `stdin` contains tests - 11 inputs, `x` is the third character in string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False, 'YES' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
