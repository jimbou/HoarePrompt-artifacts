Postcondition: ***`tests` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains `tests - 1` inputs, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `counter` is 0, `x` is the first character in the string `c`. If the first character `x` of string `c` is not present in the character at index `counter` of strings `a` and `b`, then `no` is set to False, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
