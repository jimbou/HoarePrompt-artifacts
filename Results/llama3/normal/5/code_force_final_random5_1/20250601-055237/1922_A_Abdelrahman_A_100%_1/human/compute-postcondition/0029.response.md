Postcondition: ***`tests` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `tests - 1` inputs, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `counter` is 2, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
