Postcondition: ***tests is greater than 0, i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains tests - 1 inputs. If c is equal to a or b, then 'NO' is printed and no is False. If c is not equal to a or b, then c must have at least as many characters as slength, counter is equal to slength, and no is False if any character in c is not present in the corresponding index of a and b, otherwise no is True.***
