Output State: **`tests` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `tests - 1` inputs, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `counter` is 2, `x` is the third character in the string `c`, `no` is False, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The program has printed 'YES' and the stdin still contains `tests - 1` inputs.
