Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The program checks if string c can be formed by taking one character from either string a or string b at each corresponding index. However, the problem statement requires the program to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program's logic is opposite to the problem's requirement.

Correctness: **False**
