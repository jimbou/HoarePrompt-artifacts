Postcondition: **tests is greater than 1, i is 1, slength is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the second input value, b is a string equal to the third input value, c is a string equal to the fourth input value, stdin contains tests - 5 inputs. If c is equal to a or b, then no is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, c must have at least as many characters as slength, counter is equal to slength, and no is False if any character in c is not in the corresponding character of a and b, otherwise no is True.**
