Output State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is a non-negative integer, and balance is a non-negative integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has processed all the characters in the expression string. The value of 'expression' and 'length' remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The value of 'count' is a non-negative integer, indicating the number of times the balance became negative during the processing of the expression. The value of 'balance' is a non-negative integer, representing the final balance after processing all the characters in the expression.
