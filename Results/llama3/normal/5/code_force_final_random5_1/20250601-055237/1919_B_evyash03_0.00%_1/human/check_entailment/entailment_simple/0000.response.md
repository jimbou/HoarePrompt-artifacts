Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum possible penalty for a given string of '+' and '-' characters. The program splits the string into subarrays based on the '-' character and calculates the penalty for each subarray.

The function `func_1` calculates the penalty by iterating through the string and maintaining a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the balance is greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one '+' character left.

The main program reads the input, splits the string into parts based on the '-' character, calculates the length of the result, and calls the `func_1` function to calculate the penalty.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
