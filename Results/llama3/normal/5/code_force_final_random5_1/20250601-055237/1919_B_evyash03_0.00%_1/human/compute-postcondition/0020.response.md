In this output state, the value of `balance` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The `expression` still consists of "+" and "-" characters with a length of at least 2, and the `length` variable still represents the length of the `expression`. The first character of the `expression` (`char`) is still either '+' or '-'.
