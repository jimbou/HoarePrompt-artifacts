Output State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must not be empty, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is 1, balance is 0, and the first character in the expression (char) is either '+' or '-'.**

The code snippet increments the value of `count` by 1, making it 1. Then, it sets the value of `balance` to 0. The values of `expression`, `length`, and `char` remain unchanged. The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, with the updated values of `count` and `balance`.
