According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression. If the expression is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is 0, balance is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the expression must not be empty and char is the first character in the expression.
State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must not be empty, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is 0, balance is 0, char is the first character in the expression**
