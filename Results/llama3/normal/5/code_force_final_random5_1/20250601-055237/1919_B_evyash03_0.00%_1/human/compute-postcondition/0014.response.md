The code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `balance`, we can only conclude that `balance` is decreased by 1.

The other variables, `expression`, `length`, and `char`, are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must not be empty, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is either '+' or '-', and `balance` is decreased by 1.**
