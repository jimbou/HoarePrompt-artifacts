Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty. The problem description states that the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. However, the program does not correctly calculate this penalty.

For example, consider the input string "+-+-+--". The program will split this string into parts ["+", "-", "+", "-", "+", "--"] and calculate the length of each part. However, it does not correctly calculate the penalty for each part.

The correct penalty for the part ["+"] is 1 (absolute value of sum is 1, length is 1), for the part ["-"] is 1 (absolute value of sum is 1, length is 1), for the part ["+"] is 1 (absolute value of sum is 1, length is 1), for the part ["-"] is 1 (absolute value of sum is 1, length is 1), for the part ["+"] is 1 (absolute value of sum is 1, length is 1), and for the part ["--"] is 2 (absolute value of sum is 2, length is 2). The total penalty is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7.

However, the program will calculate the penalty as 6, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
