The only variable in the loop head is variable char and expression, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression. If the expression is not empty the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must not be empty, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, and the first character in the expression (char) is either '+' or '-'. So for the loop to be executed one more time the expression must have at least 2 characters and the char is the second character in the expression.
State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, and the first character in the expression (char) is either '+' or '-'**
