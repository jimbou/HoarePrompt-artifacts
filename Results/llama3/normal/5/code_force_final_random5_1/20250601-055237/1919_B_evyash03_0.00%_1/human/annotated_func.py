#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is a non-negative integer, and balance is a non-negative integer.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the sum of count and 1 if balance is greater than 0, otherwise it returns count.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of times the balance goes below zero and returns the total count, plus one if the final balance is positive. It takes a string of "+" and "-" characters and its length as input, and returns a non-negative integer.
