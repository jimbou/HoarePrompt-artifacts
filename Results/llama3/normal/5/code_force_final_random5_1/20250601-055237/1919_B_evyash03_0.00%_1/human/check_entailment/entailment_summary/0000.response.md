Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum possible penalty for a given string of "+" and "-" characters. The program works by splitting the string into parts separated by "-" characters and then calculating the total length of these parts. It then calls the function func_1 to calculate the minimum penalty.

The function func_1 works by iterating over the characters in the string, maintaining a balance of "+" and "-" characters. Whenever the balance goes below zero, it increments a count and resets the balance to zero. Finally, it returns the count plus one if the final balance is positive.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function func_1 is called with the original string and the total length of the parts, but it does not use the length parameter. Instead, it should calculate the penalty based on the balance and the length of the parts.

Moreover, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. The minimum penalty is not necessarily the number of times the balance goes below zero plus one if the final balance is positive. The program should calculate the penalty for each part and sum them up.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
