Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by first splitting the input string into parts separated by '-'. It then calculates the total length of these parts and passes this length along with the original expression to the function func_1.

The function func_1 iterates over the characters in the expression, maintaining a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments a count and resets the balance to 0. After iterating over all characters, it adds 1 to the count if the balance is positive.

However, the logic of the program is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program does not correctly calculate the penalty of the subarrays. It only counts the number of times the balance becomes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This does not take into account the length of the subarrays, which is a crucial factor in calculating the penalty.

Moreover, the program does not actually split the array into subarrays. It only splits the input string into parts separated by '-', but it does not use these parts to calculate the penalty.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
