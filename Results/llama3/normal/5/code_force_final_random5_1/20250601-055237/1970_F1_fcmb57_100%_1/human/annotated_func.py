#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and a and b are both odd.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns two values: x + dx and y + dy. x + dx is an even integer between 6 and 198, and y + dy is an even integer between 6 and 198.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two pairs of non-negative integers as input, adds the corresponding elements of the pairs together, and returns the two resulting sums as a pair of even integers. The function does not modify the input variables. The returned sums are guaranteed to be even integers between 6 and 198.
