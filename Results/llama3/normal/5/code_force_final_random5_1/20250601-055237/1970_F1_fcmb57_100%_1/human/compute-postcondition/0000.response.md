Output State: **a is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= a <= 99 and a is odd, b is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= b <= 99 and b is odd, x is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= x <= 99 and x is odd, y is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= y <= 99 and y is odd, dx is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= dx <= 99 and dx is odd, dy is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= dy <= 99 and dy is odd**

The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` to `x`, `y` and `dx`, `dy` respectively. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers between 3 and 99 (inclusive) and are both odd, `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` will also be non-negative integers between 3 and 99 (inclusive) and will be odd. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
