This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string containing only "U" and "D" characters. It then checks if the count of "U" characters in the string is odd or even. If the count is odd, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
