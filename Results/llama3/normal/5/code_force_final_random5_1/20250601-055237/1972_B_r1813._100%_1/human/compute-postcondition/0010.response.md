The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, index is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, data is a list of strings where the first element is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", _ is 1, n is the integer value of the third element in the data list, s is the string value of the fourth element in the data list, count_u is the count of 'U' characters in the string s. If the count of 'U' characters in the string s is odd, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
