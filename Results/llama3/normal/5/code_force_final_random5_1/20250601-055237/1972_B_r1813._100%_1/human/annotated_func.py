#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and then a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D".
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t is 0, index is 2 * t + 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, data is a list of strings where the first element is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", _ is t - 1, n is the integer value of the third element in the data list, s is the string value of the fourth element in the data list, count_u is the count of 'U' characters in the string s. If the count of 'U' characters in the string s is odd, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string containing only "U" and "D" characters. It then checks if the count of "U" characters in the string is odd or even. If the count is odd, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
