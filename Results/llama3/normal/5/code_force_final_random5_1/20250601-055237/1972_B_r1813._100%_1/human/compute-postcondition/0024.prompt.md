Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, index is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, data is a list of strings where the first element is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D"
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    s = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    count_u = s.count('U')
    if count_u % 2 == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, index is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, data is a list of strings where the first element is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", _ is 0, n is the integer value of the third element in the data list, s is the string value of the fourth element in the data list, count_u is the count of 'U' characters in the string s. If the count of 'U' characters in the string s is odd, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, index is 6, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, data is a list of strings where the first element is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", _ is 1, n is the integer value of the third element in the data list, s is the string value of the fourth element in the data list, count_u is the count of 'U' characters in the string s. If the count of 'U' characters in the string s is odd, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive, index is 8, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, data is a list of strings where the first element is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", _ is 2, n is the integer value of the third element in the data list, s is the string value of the fourth element in the data list, count_u is the count of 'U' characters in the string s. If the count of 'U' characters in the string s is odd, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
