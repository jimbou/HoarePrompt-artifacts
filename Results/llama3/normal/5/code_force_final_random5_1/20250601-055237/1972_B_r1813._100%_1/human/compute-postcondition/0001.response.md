To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, we don't need to adjust its range. However, we do need to adjust the state of `_` to reflect that it will take on the value of the current iteration, starting from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `index` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `data` is a list of strings where the first element is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `_` is 0**
