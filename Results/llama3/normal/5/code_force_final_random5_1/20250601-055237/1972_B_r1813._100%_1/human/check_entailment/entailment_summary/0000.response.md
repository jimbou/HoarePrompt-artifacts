Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine who will win the game based on the number of "U" characters in the string. The program reads the input, counts the number of "U" characters, and checks if the count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it prints "YES", indicating that Alice will win the game. Otherwise, it prints "NO", indicating that Bob will win the game.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the number of "U" characters is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of "U" characters, forcing Bob to lose. On the other hand, if the number of "U" characters is even, Bob can always make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of "U" characters, forcing Alice to lose.

The program's implementation is also correct, as it correctly reads the input, processes the data, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
