Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, cats_to_add is an integer equal to the number of positions where s1 has '0' and s2 has '1', cats_to_remove is an integer equal to the number of positions where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'**

The code calculates the number of positions where s1 has '0' and s2 has '1' and assigns it to cats_to_add. It also calculates the number of positions where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0' and assigns it to cats_to_remove. The values of n, s1, and s2 remain unchanged.
