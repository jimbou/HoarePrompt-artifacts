The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1, so for the loop to be executed one more time x must still be greater than 1 and not equal to 1.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `max` is either 99999998, 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999, 100000000, -100000000 or -99999999, `i` is 2, the value of `t` which is 2 has been printed, and the elements of the list `ans` have been printed. Additionally, if `x` is even, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 and `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, otherwise `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000 and `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000. If `x` is even, `x` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to half of its original value.**
