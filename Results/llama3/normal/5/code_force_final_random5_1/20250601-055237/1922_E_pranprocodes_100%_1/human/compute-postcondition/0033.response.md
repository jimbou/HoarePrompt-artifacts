Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000. If `x` is even, `x` is equal to half of its original value and `max` is 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1 and `min` is -100000000 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, and it is now 1. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The conditions related to the parity of `x` and the values of `max` and `min` are still valid.
