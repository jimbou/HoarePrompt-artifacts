Output State: **i is 0, t is 1, ans is a list containing 100000000 and max, max is 99999998, and x is halved from its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `i` and `t` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` is halved from its original value, as specified in the initial state. The list `ans` now contains two elements: 100000000 and the new value of `max`, which is 99999998. The value of `max` is decremented by 1 from its original value of 99999999.
