The variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if x was originally even, then x is halved and if x was originally odd, then x is decreased by 1. In both cases, x is not equal to 1, so it needs to be adjusted to x is not equal to 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains at least one less integer input, if x was originally even, then x is halved and max is 99999999, and ans is a list containing 100000000. If x was originally odd, then x is decreased by 1, min is -99999999, and ans is a list containing -100000000 and x is not equal to 1**
