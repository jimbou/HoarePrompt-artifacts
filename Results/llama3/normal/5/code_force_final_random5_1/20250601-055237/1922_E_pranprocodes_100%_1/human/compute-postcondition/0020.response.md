Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the loop executed, `max` is either 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed if `x` was originally even, or 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed plus 1 if `x` was originally odd, `min` is either -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed if `x` was originally odd, or -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed minus 1 if `x` was originally even, `ans` is a list containing the values of `min` and `max` in the order they were appended.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still 1, the number of times the loop executed is still `t`, the maximum value is still either 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed if `x` was originally even, or 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed plus 1 if `x` was originally odd, the minimum value is still either -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed if `x` was originally odd, or -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed minus 1 if `x` was originally even. The list `ans` now contains the values of `min` and `max` in the reverse order they were originally appended.
