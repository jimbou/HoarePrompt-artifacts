Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `max` and `min` are updated based on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000 + 1, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 2, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and -100000000 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`, remain unchanged, with their values still dependent on whether `x` is even or odd.
