Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array by appending either a decreasing sequence of positive integers or an increasing sequence of negative integers, depending on whether X is even or odd. The program also correctly handles the case where X is 1, in which case the array is empty.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct output for each input value X.

Correctness: **True**
