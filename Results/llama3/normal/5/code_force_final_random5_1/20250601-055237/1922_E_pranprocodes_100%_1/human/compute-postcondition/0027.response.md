To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `x` in the loop head. According to the code, the loop can execute if `x` is not equal to 1. Since `x` is an integer, we can adjust its state to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

State: **x is an integer not equal to 1, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, stdin contains no input**
