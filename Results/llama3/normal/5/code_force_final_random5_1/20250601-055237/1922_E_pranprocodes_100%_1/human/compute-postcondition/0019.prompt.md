Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains at least one less integer input, i is 0, x is an integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, t is 0
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains at least one less integer input, if x was originally even, then x is halved and max is 99999999, and ans is a list containing 100000000. If x was originally odd, then x is decreased by 1, min is -99999999, and ans is a list containing -100000000.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 0, `t` is 2. If `x` was originally even, then `x` is halved from its original value, `max` is 99999998, and `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and `max`. If `x` was originally odd, then `x` is decreased by 2 from its original value, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and `x`'s original value minus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 0, `t` is 3. If `x` was originally even, then `x` is either a quarter of its original value and not equal to 1, or decreased by 3 from its original value and not equal to 1. `max` is either 99999997 or 99999999. `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and either 99999998 and 99999997, or 99999998 and `x`'s original value minus 3. If `x` was originally odd, then `x` is either half of its original value minus 1 and not equal to 1, or decreased by 3 from its original value and not equal to 1. `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997. `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and either `x`'s original value minus 1 and 99999998, or -99999997 and `x`'s original value minus 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
