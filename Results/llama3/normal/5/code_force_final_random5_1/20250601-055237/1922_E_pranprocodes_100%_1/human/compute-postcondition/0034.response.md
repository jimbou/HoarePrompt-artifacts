The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer not equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, x must still not be equal to 1.
State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000. If `x` is even, `x` is equal to half of its original value and `max` is 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1 and `min` is -100000000 + 1.**
