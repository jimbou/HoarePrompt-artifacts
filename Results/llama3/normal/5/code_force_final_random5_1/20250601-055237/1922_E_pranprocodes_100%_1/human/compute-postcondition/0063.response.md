Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `max` is either 99999998, 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999, 100000000, -100000000 or -99999999, `i` is 2, the value of `t` which is 2 has been printed, and the elements of the list `ans` have been printed. Additionally, if `x` is even, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 and `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, otherwise `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000 and `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000. If `x` is even, `x` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to half of its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `x` being even or odd still apply.
