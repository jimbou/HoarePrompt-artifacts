Postcondition: **x is an integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1, t is 1, max is either 99999998, 99999999 or 100000000, min is either -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999, 100000000, -100000000 or -99999999, i is 2, the value of t which is 1 has been printed, and the elements of the list ans have been printed. Additionally, if x is even, max is either 99999998 or 99999999 and min is either -100000000 or -99999999, otherwise max is either 99999999 or 100000000 and min is either -99999999 or -100000000. If x is even, x is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to half of its original value.**
