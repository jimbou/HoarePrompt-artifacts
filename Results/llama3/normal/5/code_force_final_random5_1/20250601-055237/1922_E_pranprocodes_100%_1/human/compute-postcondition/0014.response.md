The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is either halved from its original value or decreased by 2 from its original value. In both cases, x is not equal to 1, so for the loop to be executed one more time x must not be equal to 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2. If `x` was originally even, then `x` is halved from its original value and not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998, and `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and `max`. If `x` was originally odd, then `x` is decreased by 2 from its original value and not equal to 1, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and `x`'s original value minus 1.**
