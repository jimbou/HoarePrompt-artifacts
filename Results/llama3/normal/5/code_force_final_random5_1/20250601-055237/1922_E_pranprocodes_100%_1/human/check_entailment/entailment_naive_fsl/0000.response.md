Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly generates an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The approach used is to start with the maximum possible value (100000000) and decrease it by 1 each time a new element is added to the array, or start with the minimum possible value (-100000000) and increase it by 1 each time a new element is added to the array. This ensures that the array has the maximum number of increasing subsequences.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, when X is a power of 2, the program generates an array with all elements equal to the maximum possible value. When X is not a power of 2, the program generates an array with a mix of maximum and minimum possible values.

The program also handles the case when X is 1 correctly, by not adding any elements to the array.

The program's output is also correct. It prints the length of the array and the array itself, as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
