Output State: **x is an integer greater than 2, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, i is 2, the value of t which is 0 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans which are empty are being printed.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since the input is greater than 2, `x` becomes an integer greater than 2. The second line assigns 100000000 to `max`, making `max` equal to 100000000. The third line assigns -100000000 to `min`, making `min` equal to -100000000. The fourth line creates an empty list and assigns it to `ans`, making `ans` an empty list. The fifth line assigns 0 to `t`, making `t` equal to 0. The value of `t` which is 0 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are empty are being printed. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
