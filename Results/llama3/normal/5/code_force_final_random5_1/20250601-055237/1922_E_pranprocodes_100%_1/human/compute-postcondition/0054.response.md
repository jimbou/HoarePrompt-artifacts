Output State: **x is an integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1, t is 0, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, ans is a list containing 100000000, i is 2, the value of t which is 0 has been printed, and the elements of the list ans which are 100000000 have been printed. Additionally, the current value of x is an integer.**

In this output state, the value of x has been divided by 2, so it is now an integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1. The value of max has been decremented by 1, so it is now 99999999. The list ans now contains the original value of max, which is 100000000. The value of t, min, and i remain unchanged. The printed values of t and the elements of ans have also been updated accordingly.
