Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `t` is 1. If `x` was originally even, then `x` is halved from its original value, `max` is 99999998, and `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and `max`. If `x` was originally odd, then `x` is decreased by 2 from its original value, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and `x`'s original value minus 1.***
