Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains at least one less integer input, if x was originally even, then x is halved and max is 99999999, and ans is a list containing 100000000. If x was originally odd, then x is decreased by 1, min is -99999999, and ans is a list containing -100000000.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions based on whether `x` was originally even or odd still apply. The stdin still contains at least one less integer input.
