The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input. If `i` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the number of times the loop executed which is `t`, and `t` is 1. So for the loop to execute again `i` must be 2 and `t` must be 2.
State: **`x` is 1, `t` is 2, `max` is either 100000000 minus 2 if `x` was originally even, or 100000000 minus 2 plus 1 if `x` was originally odd, `min` is either -100000000 plus 2 if `x` was originally odd, or -100000000 plus 2 minus 1 if `x` was originally even, `ans` is a list containing the values of `min` and `max` in the order they were appended**
