Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of positive integers from standard input, where each integer represents a value X. For each X, it performs a series of operations, appending either a decreasing sequence of positive integers (starting from 100,000,000) or an increasing sequence of negative integers (starting from -100,000,000) to a list, until X becomes 1. The function then prints the number of operations performed and the list of appended integers in reverse order. The function repeats this process for each input value X.**
