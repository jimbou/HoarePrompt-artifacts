The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `ans`. The initial state of `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1.

After reversing the list, the first element becomes the last element, and the last element becomes the first element. Therefore, the new state of `ans` is a list containing either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1 and either 100000000 or -100000000.

The values of the other variables, `x`, `t`, `max`, and `min`, are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `max` is either 99999999 or 99999998, `min` is either -100000000 + 1 or -100000000 + 2, `ans` is a list containing either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1 and either 100000000 or -100000000.**
