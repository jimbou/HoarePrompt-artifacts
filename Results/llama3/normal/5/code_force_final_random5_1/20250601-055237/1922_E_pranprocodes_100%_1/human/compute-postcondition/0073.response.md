The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains three elements, each of which is either 99999998, 99999999, 100000000, -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000. Since the exact elements of the list `ans` are not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the three elements of the list `ans`.

Output: **99999998, 99999999, 100000000 or -100000000, -99999999, -100000000 (where the three numbers are the elements of the list ans)**
