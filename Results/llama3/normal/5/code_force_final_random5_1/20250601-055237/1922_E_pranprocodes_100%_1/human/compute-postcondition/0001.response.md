Output State: **stdin contains at least one less integer input, i is 0, x is an integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, t is 0**

In this output state, the value of `x` is an integer because it is assigned the value of an integer input from `stdin`. The value of `max` is 100000000 and the value of `min` is -100000000 because they are explicitly assigned these values. The value of `ans` is an empty list because it is initialized as an empty list. The value of `t` is 0 because it is initialized as 0. The value of `i` remains 0 because it is not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that at least one integer input has been consumed.
