Output State: **x is an integer equal to half of its original value, t is 1, max is 99999998, min is -100000000 + 1, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 99999999.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been halved due to the third line of code, regardless of whether it was originally even or odd. The value of `max` has been decremented by 1 due to the second line of code. The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the original value of `max` (99999999), appended by the first line of code. The values of `t` and `min` remain unchanged.
