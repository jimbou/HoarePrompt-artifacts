Output State: **x is an integer not equal to 1 and is halved if it was even or decreased by 2 if it was odd, t is 2, max is 99999998 if x was even or 99999999 if x was odd and then decreased by 1, min is -100000000 + 1 if x was even or -100000000 + 2 if x was odd, and ans contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been modified based on whether it was even or odd. If `x` was even, it has been halved, and if it was odd, it has been decreased by 2. The value of `max` has been updated based on whether `x` was even or odd and then decreased by 1. The value of `min` has also been updated based on whether `x` was even or odd. The list `ans` now contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 2.
