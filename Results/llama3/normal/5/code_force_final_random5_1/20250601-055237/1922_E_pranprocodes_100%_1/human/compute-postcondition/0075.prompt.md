Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (the values of X for each test case). Each value of X is a positive integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = []
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(max)
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans.append(min)
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    ans.reverse()
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the loop executed, `max` is either 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed if `x` was originally even, or 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed plus 1 if `x` was originally odd, `min` is either -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed if `x` was originally odd, or -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed minus 1 if `x` was originally even, `ans` is a list containing the values of `min` and `max` in the order they were appended, and the number of times the loop executed which is `t` is being printed, and the list `ans` containing the values of `min` and `max` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `max` is either 99999999 or 99999998, `min` is either -100000000 + 1 or -100000000 + 2, `ans` is a list containing either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1 and either 100000000 or -100000000, and the value of `t` which is a positive integer is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are either 99999999 and 100000000 or -100000000 + 1 and -100000000 are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: x is 1, t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, max is either 99999997, 99999998, 99999999 or 100000000, min is either -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000, ans is a list containing either 99999998, 99999999, 100000000, -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000 and either 99999999, 100000000, -100000000 or -99999999 and either 100000000 or -100000000, i is 2, the value of t which is an integer greater than or equal to 3 has been printed, and the elements of the list ans have been printed, and the value of t which is an integer greater than or equal to 3 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans which are either 99999998, 99999999, 100000000, -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000 and either 99999999, 100000000, -100000000 or -99999999 and either 100000000 or -100000000 are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
