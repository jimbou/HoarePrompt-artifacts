Output State: **x is an integer, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, stdin contains no input**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. `x = int(input())`: This line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was originally 1, it becomes the integer value of the input.
2. `max = 100000000`: This line assigns the value 100000000 to `max`, overwriting its original value.
3. `min = -100000000`: This line assigns the value -100000000 to `min`, overwriting its original value.
4. `ans = []`: This line creates an empty list and assigns it to `ans`, overwriting its original value.
5. `t = 0`: This line assigns the value 0 to `t`, overwriting its original value.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `x` is an integer, which is the value of the input.
* `t` is 0.
* `max` is 100000000.
* `min` is -100000000.
* `ans` is an empty list.
* Stdin contains no input, as the input has been consumed by the `int(input())` statement.

Note that the original values of `max` and `min` are not relevant in the final state, as they are overwritten by the code. Similarly, the original value of `ans` is not relevant, as it is overwritten by the code.
