Output State: **x is an integer greater than 2 and not equal to 1, t is 1, max is either 99999999 or 100000000, min is either -100000000 or -99999999, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, i is 2, the value of t which is 1 has been printed, and the elements of the list ans have been printed. Additionally, if x is even, max is 99999999 and min is -100000000, otherwise max is 100000000 and min is -99999999.**

In this output state, the value of t has been incremented by 1, and the value of t which is 1 has been printed. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of max and min is still dependent on whether x is even or odd.
