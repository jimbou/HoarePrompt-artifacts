To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if there is at least one input from `stdin` that can be converted to an integer. Since the input is expected to be a sequence of integers, we need to ensure that there is at least one integer available in the input.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`stdin` contains at least one integer input, `i` is 0**

Note that we don't need to specify the exact value of the integer input, just that there is at least one integer available. The value of `i` is set to 0, which is the starting value of the range.
