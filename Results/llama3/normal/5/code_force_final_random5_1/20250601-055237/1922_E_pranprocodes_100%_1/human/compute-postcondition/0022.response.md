Output: **`x` is 1, `t` is the number of times the loop executed, `max` is either 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed if `x` was originally even, or 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed plus 1 if `x` was originally odd, `min` is either -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed if `x` was originally odd, or -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed minus 1 if `x` was originally even, `ans` is a list containing the values of `min` and `max` in the order they were appended, and the number of times the loop executed which is `t` is being printed**
