The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Since `x` is 1, which is an odd number, `max` is calculated as 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed plus 1, and `min` is calculated as -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed.

The `ans` list contains the values of `min` and `max` in the order they were appended. Since `min` is appended first, it will be printed first, followed by `max`.

Output: **-100000000 + t, 100000000 - t + 1 (where t is the number of times the loop executed)**
