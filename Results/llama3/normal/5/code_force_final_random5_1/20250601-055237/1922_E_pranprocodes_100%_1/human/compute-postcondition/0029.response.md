Output State: **x is an integer equal to half of its original value, t is 0, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, ans is a list containing 100000000, and stdin contains no input.**

The code first appends the current value of max, which is 100000000, to the list ans. Then, it decrements max by 1, making it 99999999. Finally, it divides x by 2 using integer division (//), effectively halving its value. Since x was initially even, the result of the division is an integer. The values of t and min remain unchanged, and stdin still contains no input.
