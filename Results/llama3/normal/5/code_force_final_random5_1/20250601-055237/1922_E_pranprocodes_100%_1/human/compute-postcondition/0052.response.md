The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, x is an integer greater than 2, So for the loop to  executed the first time x must not be equal to 1.
State: **x is an integer greater than 2 and not equal to 1, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, i is 2, the value of t which is 0 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans which are empty are being printed.**
