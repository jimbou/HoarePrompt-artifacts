Output State: **x is 1, t is a positive integer, max is either 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed if x was originally even, or 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed plus 1 if x was originally odd, min is either -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed if x was originally odd, or -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed minus 1 if x was originally even, ans is a list containing the values of min and max in the order they were appended, and the number of times the loop executed which is t is being printed, and the list ans containing the values of min and max is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of x is 1, the value of t is a positive integer representing the number of times the loop executed, the value of max is either 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed if x was originally even, or 100000000 minus the number of times the loop executed plus 1 if x was originally odd, the value of min is either -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed if x was originally odd, or -100000000 plus the number of times the loop executed minus 1 if x was originally even, the list ans contains the values of min and max in the order they were appended, and the number of times the loop executed (t) and the list ans are being printed.
