The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer greater than 2 and not equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must not be equal to 1.

State: **x is an integer greater than 2 and not equal to 1, t is 1, max is either 99999999 or 100000000, min is either -100000000 or -99999999, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, i is 2, the value of t which is 1 has been printed, and the elements of the list ans have been printed. Additionally, if x is even, max is 99999999 and min is -100000000, otherwise max is 100000000 and min is -99999999.**
