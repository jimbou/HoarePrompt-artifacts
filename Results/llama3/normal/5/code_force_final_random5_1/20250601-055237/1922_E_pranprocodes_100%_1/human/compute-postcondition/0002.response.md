To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `x != 1`. The loop will execute if `x` is not equal to 1. Therefore, the state of `x` needs to be adjusted.

State: **stdin contains at least one less integer input, i is 0, x is not equal to 1, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, t is 0**
