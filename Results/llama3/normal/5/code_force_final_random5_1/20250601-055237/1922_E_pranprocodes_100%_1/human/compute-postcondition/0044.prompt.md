Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000. If `x` is even, `x` is equal to half of its original value and `max` is 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1 and `min` is -100000000 + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 2, `max` and `min` are updated based on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000 + 1, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 2, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and -100000000 + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 3. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000 + 1, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 2, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and -100000000 + 1. Otherwise, `x` is decreased by 3, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 + 2 or -100000000 + 3, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
