Output State: **x is 1, t is a positive integer, max is either 99999999 or 99999998, min is either -100000000 + 1 or -100000000 + 2, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `x` is 1, indicating that the loop has terminated.
*   The value of `t` is a positive integer, representing the number of iterations the loop has executed.
*   The value of `max` is either 99999999 or 99999998, depending on whether `x` was even or odd during the last iteration.
*   The value of `min` is either -100000000 + 1 or -100000000 + 2, depending on whether `x` was even or odd during the last iteration.
*   The list `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1, representing the values appended to the list during the iterations.
