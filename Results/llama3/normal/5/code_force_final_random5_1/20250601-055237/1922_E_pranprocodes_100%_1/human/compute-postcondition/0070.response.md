Output State: **x is 1, t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, max is either 99999997, 99999998, 99999999 or 100000000, min is either -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000, ans is a list containing either 99999998, 99999999, 100000000, -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000 and either 99999999, 100000000, -100000000 or -99999999 and either 100000000 or -100000000, i is 2, the value of t which is an integer greater than or equal to 3 has been printed, and the elements of the list ans have been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of x remains 1, t remains an integer greater than or equal to 3, max remains either 99999997, 99999998, 99999999 or 100000000, min remains either -100000000, -99999999 or -100000000, the list ans has been reversed and now contains the same elements in reverse order, i remains 2, the value of t has been printed, and the elements of the list ans have been printed.
