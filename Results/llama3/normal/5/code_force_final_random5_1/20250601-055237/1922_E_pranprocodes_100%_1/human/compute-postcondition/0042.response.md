Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000 + 1, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 + 2, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and -100000000 + 1. Otherwise, `x` is decreased by 3, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 + 2 or -100000000 + 3, and `ans` contains either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -100000000 + 1.***
