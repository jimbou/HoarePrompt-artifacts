Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4) where (x1, y1) and (x3, y3) are the coordinates of the two opposite corners of the square, and (x2, y2) and (x4, y4) are the coordinates of the other two opposite corners of the square.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will not work correctly because it assumes that the first two points are opposite corners of the square, which is not the case.

A correct solution would be to find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and the minimum and maximum y-coordinates, and then calculate the side length of the square as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates or the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. The area of the square can then be calculated as the square of the side length.

Here is an example of a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())
        (x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        (x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())
        (x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())
        x_coords = [x1, x2, x3, x4]
        y_coords = [y1, y2, y3, y4]
        side_length = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

This solution works correctly for all possible inputs, including the example I provided earlier.
