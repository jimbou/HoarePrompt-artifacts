Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), stdin is empty. If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` which is a positive integer. If `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4` but `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, then if `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is equal to `y2 - y1` (which is a positive integer). Otherwise, `res` is a non-negative integer. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is a positive integer equal to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`, otherwise `res` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`, then no changes are made.***
