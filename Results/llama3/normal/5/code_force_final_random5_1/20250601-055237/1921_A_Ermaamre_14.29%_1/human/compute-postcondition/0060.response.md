Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is `a-1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), stdin is empty. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, or if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. The square of `res` is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `a` remains unchanged, but `i` will be one less than `a`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` will be the last set of input values read from stdin. The value of `res` will be the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, or the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, or if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`. The square of `res` will be printed.
