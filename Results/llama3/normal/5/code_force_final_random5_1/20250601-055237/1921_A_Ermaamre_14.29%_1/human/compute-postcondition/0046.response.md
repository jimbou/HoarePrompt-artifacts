Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`, stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial variables retain their values, and a new variable `res` is introduced, which is the absolute difference between the values of `y3` and `y1`. The stdin still contains four pairs of integers as input.
