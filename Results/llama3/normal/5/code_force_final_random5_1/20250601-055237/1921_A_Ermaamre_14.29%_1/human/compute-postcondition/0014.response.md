Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and a is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is a non-negative integer, Either `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`. The current values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` are such that `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`. `y1` is not less than `y2`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which is a non-negative integer because the absolute function always returns a non-negative value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, and `y1`, `y2` are still valid.
