Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and a is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 1000), `x1` is equal to `x4`, `x3` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is a positive integer equal to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, stdin is empty. Either `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x3` is not equal to `x4`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The value of `i` remains 0. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are still integers within the range -1000 to 1000. The relationships between `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4` and `y1`, `y2` remain the same. A new variable `res` is introduced, which is a positive integer representing the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. The stdin remains empty.
