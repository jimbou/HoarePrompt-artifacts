Functionality: **Calculates and prints the area of squares given their corner coordinates. The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of four corners of a square and calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two opposite corners. It then prints the square of the side length, which represents the area of the square. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.**
