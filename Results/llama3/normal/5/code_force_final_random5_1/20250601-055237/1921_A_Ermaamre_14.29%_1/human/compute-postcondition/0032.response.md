Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`, stdin is empty. If `y1` is less than `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.**
