Postcondition: **a is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and a is greater than 0, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers (-1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 1000), stdin is empty. Either x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4. The current values of x1, x2, x3, and x4 are such that x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4.**
