Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and a is greater than 1, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers (-1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 1000), stdin is empty, res is a non-negative integer.**

The code assigns the values of four pairs of integers from stdin to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4. Since stdin is empty after the code executes, we don't include it in the output state. The value of res is a non-negative integer, which is the square of the absolute difference between y1 and y3 if x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2 and y1 is less than y2, or y2 - y1 if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4 and y1 is less than y2. Otherwise, res is a non-negative integer. The values of a and i are not affected by the code.
