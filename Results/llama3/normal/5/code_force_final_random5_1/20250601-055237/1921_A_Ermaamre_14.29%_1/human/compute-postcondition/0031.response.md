Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: `a` is still an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is still 1, all the coordinates `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are still integers within the range -1000 to 1000, `res` is now the absolute difference between the y-coordinates `y1` and `y3`, and the standard input is still empty.
