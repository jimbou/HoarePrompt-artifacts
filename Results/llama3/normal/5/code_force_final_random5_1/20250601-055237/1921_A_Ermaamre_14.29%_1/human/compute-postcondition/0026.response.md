Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the square of the value of `res`.

The value of `res` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state. If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`, which is a positive integer. If `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4` but `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, then if `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is equal to `y2 - y1` (which is a positive integer). Otherwise, `res` is a non-negative integer. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is a positive integer equal to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`, otherwise `res` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`, then no changes are made.

Since the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the square of the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res^2 (where res is the value of res based on the conditions specified in the initial state)**
