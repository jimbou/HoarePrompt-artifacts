Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the value of `i` remains 2. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` remain integers within the range -1000 to 1000. A new variable `res` is introduced, which is assigned the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. The stdin still contains 4 inputs, which are four pairs of integers.
