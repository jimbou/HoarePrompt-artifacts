Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and a is greater than 0, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers (-1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 1000), Either x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4. If x1 is equal to x4 and x3 is equal to x2, then if y1 is less than y2, res is a positive integer equal to the absolute difference between y2 and y1. Otherwise, res is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If x1 is not equal to x4 or x3 is not equal to x2, then no changes are made.***
