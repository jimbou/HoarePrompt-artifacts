Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 100. The value of `i` is still 2. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are still integers within the range -1000 to 1000. A new variable `res` is introduced, which is the absolute difference between the values of `y1` and `y2`. The stdin still contains four pairs of integers as input.
