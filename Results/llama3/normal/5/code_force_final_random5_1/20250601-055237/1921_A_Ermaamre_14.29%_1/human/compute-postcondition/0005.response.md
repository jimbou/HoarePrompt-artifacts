Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and a is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 1000), `x1` is equal to `x3`, `x2` is equal to `x4`, `y1` is less than `y3`, `res` is equal to the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` which is a positive integer, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains unchanged between 1 and 100, `i` is still 0, and all the coordinates (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) are still integers within the range -1000 to 1000. The relationships between the coordinates also remain the same, with `x1` equal to `x3` and `x2` equal to `x4`, and `y1` less than `y3`. A new variable `res` is introduced, which is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`, resulting in a positive integer. The standard input remains empty.
