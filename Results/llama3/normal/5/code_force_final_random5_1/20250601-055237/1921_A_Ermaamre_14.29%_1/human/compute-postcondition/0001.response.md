The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains a test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i and y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.**
