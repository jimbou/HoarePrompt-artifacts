Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers (-1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 1000), stdin is empty. If x1 is equal to x3 and x2 is equal to x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1. Otherwise, if x1 is equal to x2 and x3 is equal to x4, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1. Otherwise, if x1 is equal to x4 and x3 is equal to x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1. Otherwise, the value of res remains unchanged.***
