Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of integers. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `y1` is less than `y3`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, or if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**
