Based on the initial state, the value of `res` is determined by the conditions specified. Since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we can describe the possible values of `res` based on the conditions.

If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. This means `res` will be a non-negative integer between 0 and 2000 (inclusive), since the absolute difference between two integers between -1000 and 1000 is at most 2000.

If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Again, `res` will be a non-negative integer between 0 and 2000 (inclusive).

If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Once more, `res` will be a non-negative integer between 0 and 2000 (inclusive).

In all cases, `res` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2000 (inclusive).

The `print` statement squares the value of `res` using the exponentiation operator `**`. Therefore, the output will be the square of the value of `res`.

Output: **[res^2] (where res is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2000, inclusive)**
