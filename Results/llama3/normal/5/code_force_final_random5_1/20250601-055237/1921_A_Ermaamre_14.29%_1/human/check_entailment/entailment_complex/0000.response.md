Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square. It then calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two opposite corners. Finally, it prints the square of the side length, which represents the area of the square.

The program handles all possible cases where the corners of the square are given in different orders. It checks if the x-coordinates of the first and third corners are equal, or if the x-coordinates of the first and second corners are equal, or if the x-coordinates of the first and fourth corners are equal. In each case, it calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two opposite corners.

The program also handles the case where the y-coordinates of the two opposite corners are equal, in which case the side length of the square is zero. However, according to the problem description, the area of the square is strictly greater than zero, so this case is not possible.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
