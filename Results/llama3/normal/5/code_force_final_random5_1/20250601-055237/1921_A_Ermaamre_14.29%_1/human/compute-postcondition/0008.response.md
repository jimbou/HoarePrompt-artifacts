Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `x1` equals `x3`, `x2` equals `x4`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` which is a positive integer, stdin is empty.**
