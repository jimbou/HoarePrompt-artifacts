Output State: **a is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers (-1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 1000), stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of integers.**

The code block consists of four lines, each attempting to read a pair of integers from the standard input (stdin) and assign them to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, respectively. However, the initial state specifies that stdin is empty, meaning there are no inputs available to be read.

As a result, the execution of this code block will not modify the values of any variables, including x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, because there are no inputs to assign to them. The variables a and i remain unchanged as well, since they are not affected by the code.

The final state reflects that the values of a and i remain the same, and the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are still integers within their specified ranges, but their exact values are not updated due to the absence of input. Stdin remains empty, as no inputs were provided to be read.
