Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which is a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin is still empty.
