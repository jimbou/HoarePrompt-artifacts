Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`, stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is now the absolute difference between the values of `y1` and `y3`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains four pairs of integers.
