Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains a test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i and y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), stdin is empty. If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` which is a positive integer. If `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4` but `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, then if `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is equal to `y2 - y1` (which is a positive integer). Otherwise, `res` is a non-negative integer. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is a positive integer equal to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`, otherwise `res` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`, then no changes are made. The square of `res` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 are integers (-1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4 <= 1000), stdin is empty. If x1 is equal to x3 and x2 is equal to x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1. Otherwise, if x1 is equal to x2 and x3 is equal to x4, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1. Otherwise, if x1 is equal to x4 and x3 is equal to x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1. Otherwise, the value of res remains unchanged, and the square of res is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of integers. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `y1` is less than `y3`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, or if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. The square of `res` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
