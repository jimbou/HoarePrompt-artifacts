Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, either `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is equal to `y2 - y1` (which is a positive integer).**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial properties, and a new variable `res` is introduced, which is assigned the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Since `y1` is less than `y2`, the absolute difference is simply `y2 - y1`, which is a positive integer.
