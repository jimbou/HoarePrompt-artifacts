Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `x1` equals `x3`, `x2` equals `x4`, `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `a` is still an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` remains 0, and all the coordinates (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) are still integers within the range -1000 to 1000. The relationships between the coordinates are maintained: `x1` is still equal to `x3`, `x2` is still equal to `x4`, and `y1` is still greater than or equal to `y3`. A new variable `res` is introduced, which holds the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
