Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and a is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers (-1000 <= `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` <= 1000), `res` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, Either `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x3` is not equal to `x4`. The current value of `x1` is equal to `x4` and the current value of `x3` is equal to `x2`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which is greater than or equal to 0 since `y1` is larger than or equal to `y2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
