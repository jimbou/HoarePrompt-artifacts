Output State: **size is increased by 2, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), number must be greater than or equal to (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)**

In this final state, the value of `size` has been increased by 2 due to the first line of the code, which increments `size` by 1, and the initial state already had `size` increased by 1. The value of `value` has been updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which is a new calculation based on the updated value of `size`. The constraint on `number` remains the same, requiring it to be greater than or equal to `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)`, which is also updated based on the new value of `size`.
