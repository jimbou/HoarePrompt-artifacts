Output State: **size_overlap is equal to i + k, i is greater than or equal to 0, size is equal to i + k, value is (1 << (i + k)) - (1 << i), and number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + k)) - (1 << i)**

The first line assigns the value of `size` to `size_overlap`, making `size_overlap` equal to `i + k`. The second line does not affect any variables. The value of `i` remains greater than or equal to 0. The value of `size` remains equal to `i + k`. The value of `value` remains `(1 << (i + k)) - (1 << i)`. The value of `number` remains greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + k)) - (1 << i)`.
