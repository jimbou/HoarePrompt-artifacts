State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + 1 + size)) - (1 << (i + 1)), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than `i + overlap`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list plus 1, `size` is greater than 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i + 1)), and `overlap` is less than `size`.**
