Output State: **size is equal to i + k, value is (1 << (i + k)) - (1 << i), number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + k)) - (1 << i), size_overlap is equal to i + 1, and i is greater than or equal to 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the size is equal to i plus the number of iterations k, the value is the difference between 2 to the power of i plus k and 2 to the power of i, the number is greater than or equal to the difference between 2 to the power of i plus k and 2 to the power of i, the size_overlap is equal to i plus 1, and i is greater than or equal to 0.
