To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it. The loop head is `for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `size` is increased by the number of times the loop executes.
- `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`.
- `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`.
- If the current `value` is less than or equal to `number`, then `size_overlap` is equal to the current `value` of `size` and `i` is equal to the current `value` of `i`.

The loop head involves `i` and the range defined by `max(sequence, default=0)` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than `-1` since the loop iterates until `i` reaches `-1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we adjust `i` to be one less than its current value for the loop to execute again.

State: **`size` is increased by the number of times the loop executes, `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << (i-1))`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << (i-1))`, `size_overlap` is equal to the current `value` of `size`, and `i` is one less than its current value**
