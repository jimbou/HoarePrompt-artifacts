Output State: **number is greater than or equal to 3, sequence is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, size_overlap is a tuple containing two zeros (0, 0), i is the maximum value of the sequence list, size is i + 3, and value is (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)**

In this output state, the value of `number` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The `sequence` list also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `size_overlap` tuple remains the same, containing two zeros.

The value of `i` remains the same as it is not changed by the code, and it is still the maximum value of the `sequence` list. The value of `size` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 3`. The value of `value` is updated to `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`, which is a new value calculated based on the updated `size` and the original value of `i`.
