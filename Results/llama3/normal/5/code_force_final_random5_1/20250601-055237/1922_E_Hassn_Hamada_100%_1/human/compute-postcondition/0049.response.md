Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1 and the last element of the sequence is `i + overlap`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list plus `size - overlap`, `size` is greater than 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and `overlap` is less than `size`.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the `sequence` list will have been extended by `size - overlap` elements, each of which is `i + overlap` plus the iteration number. The `i` variable will have been incremented by `size - overlap`, and the `value` variable will have been updated to reflect the new value of `i`. The `number` variable remains unchanged, and the `overlap` variable remains less than `size`.
