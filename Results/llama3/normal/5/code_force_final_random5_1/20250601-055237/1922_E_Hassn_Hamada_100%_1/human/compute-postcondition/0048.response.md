Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + 1 + size)) - (1 << (i + 1)), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than `i + overlap`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list plus 1, `size` is greater than 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i + 1)), `overlap` is less than `size`, and `sequence` now includes an additional element `i + overlap`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `number` remains the same, being greater than or equal to the calculated value. The `sequence` list now includes an additional element, which is the sum of `i` and `overlap`. The maximum value of the `sequence` list is still greater than `i + overlap`. The value of `i` remains the same, being the maximum value of the `sequence` list plus 1. The value of `size` is still greater than 0. The value of `value` remains the same, being the calculated value. The value of `overlap` is still less than `size`.
