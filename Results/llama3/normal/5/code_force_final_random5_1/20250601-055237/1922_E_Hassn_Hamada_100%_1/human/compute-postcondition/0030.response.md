Output State: **`size` is equal to `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `size_overlap` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is one less than its current value**

In this output state, the value of `size` is updated to be equal to `i + 1`, and the value of `value` is updated to be equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`. The condition on `number` is also updated to be greater than or equal to the new value of `value`. The value of `size_overlap` is updated to be equal to the new value of `size`, which is `i + 1`. The value of `i` remains one less than its current value, as it was not directly modified by the code.
