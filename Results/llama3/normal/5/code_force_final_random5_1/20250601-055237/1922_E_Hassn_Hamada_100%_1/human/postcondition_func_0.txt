Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and appends it to the provided sequence list. If the input number is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates the size and overlap of the sequence to be generated and appends the corresponding numbers to the sequence list. The function then recursively calls itself with the updated number and sequence until the base case is reached, at which point it returns two zeros. The final state of the program is a populated sequence list and a returned value of two zeros.
