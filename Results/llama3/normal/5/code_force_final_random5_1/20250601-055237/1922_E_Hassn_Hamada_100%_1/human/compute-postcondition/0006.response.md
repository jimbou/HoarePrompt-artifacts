Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two zeros (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list, `size` is `i + 1`, and `value` is `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`**

In this output state, the values of `number`, `sequence`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the maximum value of the `sequence` list. The new variables `size` and `value` are introduced, where `size` is equal to `i + 1` and `value` is calculated as `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, which is equivalent to `2^(i+1) - 2^i`.
