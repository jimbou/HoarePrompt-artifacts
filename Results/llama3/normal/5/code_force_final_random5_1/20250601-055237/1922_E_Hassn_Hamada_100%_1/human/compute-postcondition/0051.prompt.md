You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers.
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values: 0 and 0. The first 0 is a positive integer that is currently equal to 0, and the second 0 is also equal to 0.
    #State: number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers. number is not equal to 0
    size_overlap = 0, 0
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
        
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = size, i
            break
        
    #State: number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), sequence is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, size_overlap is (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is (0, 0), i is the maximum value of the sequence list, size is the minimum value such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number, and value is (1 << size) - (1 << i).
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: `number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1 and the last element of the sequence is `i + overlap`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list plus `size - overlap`, `size` is greater than 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and `overlap` is less than `size`.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns two values: 0 and 0. The first 0 is a positive integer that is currently equal to 0, and the second 0 is also equal to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
