Output State: **size is increased by 1, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)**

The first line increments the value of `size` by 1. The second line calculates the value of `value` using the updated `size` and the existing value of `i`. The expression `(1 << size)` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `size` places, effectively multiplying it by 2 to the power of `size`. The expression `(1 << i)` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` places, effectively multiplying it by 2 to the power of `i`. The subtraction of these two values gives the final value of `value`.
