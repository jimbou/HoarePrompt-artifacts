Output State: **size is increased by 3, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), number must be greater than or equal to (1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i)**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been increased by 1 from its initial state, which was already increased by 2. The value of `value` has been updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which is equivalent to `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)` since `size` has been increased by 1. The constraint on `number` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code.
