Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1 and the last element of the sequence is `i + overlap`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list plus 1, `size` is greater than 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and `overlap` is less than `size`.**

In this output state, the value of `sequence` has been updated by appending `i + overlap` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The last element of the `sequence` list is now `i + overlap`, and the maximum value of the sequence list is still greater than -1. The values of `number`, `i`, `size`, `value`, and `overlap` are unchanged.
