According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `size`, `i`, and `number`. If `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is equal to `i + 2`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `number` needs to be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`size` is equal to `i + 2`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`, `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`, `size_overlap` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0**
