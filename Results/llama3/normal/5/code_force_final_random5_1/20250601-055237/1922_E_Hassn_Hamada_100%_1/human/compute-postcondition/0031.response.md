To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` and adjust the states of `size`, `i`, and `number` accordingly.

Given the states right before the loop:

* `size` is equal to `i + 1`
* `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`
* `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`
* `size_overlap` is equal to `i + 1`
* `i` is one less than its current value

We can see that the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` depends on the values of `size`, `i`, and `number`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states as follows:

* `size` is equal to `i + 1` (no change needed)
* `i` is one less than its current value (no change needed)
* `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)` (no change needed)

However, we need to ensure that the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` is true. Since `size` is equal to `i + 1`, we can substitute this into the condition:

`(1 << (i + 1) + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`

Simplifying this, we get:

`(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) <= number`

Since `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, we need to ensure that `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)` is also greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`. This is true if and only if `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`size` is equal to `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `size_overlap` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0**
