To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from the maximum value of the `sequence` list (or 0 if the list is empty) down to -1, decrementing by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is the maximum value of the `sequence` list. To execute the loop again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

The other variables in the state (`number`, `sequence`, `size_overlap`, `size`, and `value`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i - 1 + size)) - (1 << (i - 1)), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, `size_overlap` is (size, i - 1) if (1 << size) - (1 << (i - 1)) is less than or equal to `number`, otherwise `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value of the `sequence` list minus 1, `size` is the minimum value such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << (i - 1)) > `number`, and `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << (i - 1))**
