Output State: **number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), sequence is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, size_overlap is (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is (0, 0), i is the maximum value of the sequence list, size is the minimum value such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number, and value is (1 << size) - (1 << i).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. This is because the loop will continue to execute until the condition `i >= 0` is no longer true, at which point the loop will terminate. Since the output state after 3 iterations already satisfies this condition, the output state after all iterations will be the same.
