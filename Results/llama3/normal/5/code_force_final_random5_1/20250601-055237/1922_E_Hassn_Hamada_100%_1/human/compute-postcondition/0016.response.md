Postcondition: ***number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), sequence is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, size_overlap is (size, i) if (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number, otherwise size_overlap is (0, 0), i is the maximum value of the sequence list, size is the minimum value such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number, and value is (1 << size) - (1 << i).***
