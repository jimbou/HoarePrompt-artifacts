Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input number X is 1. According to the problem description, an empty subsequence is also increasing, so the program should return an empty array for X = 1. However, the program does not handle this case and will produce incorrect results.

For example, if the input is X = 1, the program will not return an empty array, but instead will try to generate a sequence of numbers, which is not correct.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases as described in the problem description.
