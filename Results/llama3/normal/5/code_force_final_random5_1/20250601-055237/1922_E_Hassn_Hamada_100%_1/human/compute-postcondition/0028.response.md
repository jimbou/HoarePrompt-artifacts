Postcondition: **size is increased by the number of times the loop executes, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), number must be greater than or equal to (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i). If the current value of value is less than or equal to number, then size_overlap is equal to the current value of size and i is equal to the current value of i.**
