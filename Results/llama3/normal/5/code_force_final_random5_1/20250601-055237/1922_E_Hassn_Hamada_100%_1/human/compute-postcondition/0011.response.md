To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `size`, `i`, and `number`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is `i + 3`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list, and `number` is greater than or equal to 3.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `number` to be greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3) + 1) - (1 << i)`, which is equivalent to `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two zeros (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list, `size` is `i + 3`, and `value` is `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`**
