According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `size`, `i`, and `number`. If `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is increased by 1, and `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`. 

Since `size` is increased by 1, `(1 << size + 1)` is also increased. To ensure the loop can execute again, `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` must be less than or equal to `number`. Therefore, `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`size` is increased by 1, `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)`**
