Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i - 1 + size)) - (1 << (i - 1)), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, `size_overlap` is (size, i - 1) if (1 << size) - (1 << (i - 1)) is less than or equal to `number`, otherwise `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value of the `sequence` list minus 1, `size` is i + 1, and `value` is (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i).**

In this output state, the values of `number`, `sequence`, `size_overlap`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the value of `size` is updated to be `i + 1`, and the value of `value` is updated to be `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, which is equivalent to `2 * (1 << i) - (1 << i)`, or simply `(1 << i)`.
