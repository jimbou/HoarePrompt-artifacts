To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` and adjust the states of `size`, `i`, and `number` accordingly.

1. **Analysis of the condition**:
   - The condition involves `size`, `i`, and `number`.
   - The expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` needs to be less than or equal to `number` for the loop to execute.

2. **Adjusting the states**:
   - **`size` and `i`**: Given that `size` is `i + 1`, we can substitute `size` in the condition to get `(1 << (i + 1) + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`, which simplifies to `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) <= number`.
   - **`number`**: The state of `number` is already given as greater than or equal to `(1 << (i - 1 + size)) - (1 << (i - 1))`. However, for the loop to execute, `number` must also satisfy the loop condition. Since `size` is `i + 1`, the original condition for `number` can be seen as a specific case but does not directly impact the adjustment needed for the loop condition. The critical adjustment is ensuring that `number` is such that it is greater than or equal to the value calculated by `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)` for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The state of `number` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)` for the loop to execute the first time.
   - The states of `sequence`, `size_overlap`, and `value` do not directly affect the loop condition and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute the first time.

**State:** **`number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, `size_overlap` is (size, i - 1) if (1 << size) - (1 << (i - 1)) is less than or equal to `number`, otherwise `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value of the `sequence` list minus 1, `size` is i + 1, and `value` is (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)**
