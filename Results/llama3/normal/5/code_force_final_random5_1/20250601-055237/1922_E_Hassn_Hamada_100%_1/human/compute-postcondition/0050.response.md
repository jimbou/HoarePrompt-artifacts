Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1 and the last element of the sequence is `i + overlap`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list plus `size - overlap`, `size` is greater than 0, `overlap` is less than `size`, and `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and the function `func_1` has been called with arguments `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`.**

In this output state, the values of `number`, `sequence`, `i`, `size`, `overlap`, and `value` remain the same as in the initial state. The function `func_1` has been called with the specified arguments, but its return value is not specified.
