Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list, `size` is the minimum value such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), `size` is either the minimum value such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number or 0, and `overlap` is either i or 0.**

In this output state, the values of `number`, `sequence`, `i`, and `value` remain unchanged. The value of `size` is either the minimum value such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number or 0, depending on the value of `size_overlap`. The value of `overlap` is either `i` or 0, depending on the value of `size_overlap`.
