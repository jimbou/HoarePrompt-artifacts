Output State: **size is equal to i + 3, value is (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i), number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i), size_overlap is equal to i + 1, and i is greater than or equal to 0**

In this final state, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to `i + 3`. The value of `value` has been updated to `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`, which is a result of the new value of `size`. The value of `number` remains greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `size_overlap` remains equal to `i + 1`, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains greater than or equal to 0, as it was not modified by the code.
