To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that make the loop run at least once. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the `range` function, which depends on the `max` value of the `sequence` list. Here's the step-by-step thought process:

1. The `range` function starts from the maximum value in the `sequence` list (or 0 if the list is empty, thanks to the `default=0` parameter) and goes down to -1.
2. For the loop to execute, the `max` value of the `sequence` list must be greater than -1. If the `max` value is -1 or less, the loop will not execute.
3. Since `number` is a positive integer, it does not affect the loop's execution.
4. The `size_overlap` tuple is not used in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.

Considering these points, the adjusted state is:

State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two zeros (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list**

Note that I've only adjusted the states of objects in the loop head, as per the task's requirements.
