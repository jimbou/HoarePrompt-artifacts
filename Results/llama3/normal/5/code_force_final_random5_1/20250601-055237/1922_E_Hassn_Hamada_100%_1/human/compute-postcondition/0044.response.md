Output State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1 and the last element of the sequence is `i + overlap`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list, `size` is greater than 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and `overlap` is less than `size`.**

In this output state, the value of `sequence` has been updated by appending `i + overlap` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The maximum value of the sequence list is still `i`, and the other conditions on `number`, `size`, `value`, and `overlap` are still satisfied.
