To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(size - overlap):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size - overlap`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The other variables in the loop head are `size` and `overlap`. Since `size` is greater than 0 and `overlap` is less than `size`, the range `size - overlap` is still valid.

Now, let's adjust the states:

* `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the maximum value of the sequence list plus 1.
* `sequence` is still a list of integers with a maximum value greater than -1, but the last element is now `i + overlap - 1` (since `i` has been incremented).
* `number` is still greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i)`, but since `i` has been incremented, the value of `number` may have changed.
* `size` is still greater than 0.
* `value` is still `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, but since `i` has been incremented, the value of `value` may have changed.
* `overlap` is still less than `size`.

State: **`number` is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1 and the last element of the sequence is `i + overlap - 1`, `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list plus 1, `size` is greater than 0, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and `overlap` is less than `size`.**
