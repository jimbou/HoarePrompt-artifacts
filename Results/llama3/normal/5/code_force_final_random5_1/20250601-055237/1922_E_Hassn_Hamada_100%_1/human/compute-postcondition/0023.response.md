To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `size`, `i`, and `number`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is increased by 2, `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`, and `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `number` to be greater than or equal to `(1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i)`, since `size` has increased by 2.

State: **`size` is increased by 2, `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i)`**
