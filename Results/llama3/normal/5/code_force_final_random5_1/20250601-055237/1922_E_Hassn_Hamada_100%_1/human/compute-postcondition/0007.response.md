To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`. Given the initial states, we can deduce the following:

1. `size` is `i + 1`, which means `size` is greater than `i`.
2. The expression `(1 << size + 1)` is equivalent to `(1 << (i + 1) + 1)`, which simplifies to `(1 << (i + 2))`.
3. The expression `(1 << i)` remains as is.

The condition becomes `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) <= number`. To ensure this condition is true for the first iteration, we need to consider the values of `i` and `number`.

Since `i` is the maximum value of the `sequence` list, and `sequence` is a list of integers with a maximum value greater than -1, we know that `i` is at least 0 (because the maximum value is greater than -1).

Given that `number` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that the left-hand side of the condition is less than or equal to `number`. The left-hand side is a function of `i`, and its value increases as `i` increases.

To guarantee that the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that the left-hand side is less than or equal to `number` for the smallest possible value of `i`, which is 0.

When `i` is 0, the left-hand side becomes `(1 << 2) - (1 << 0) = 4 - 1 = 3`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `number` is greater than or equal to 3.

The state of `number` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`number` is greater than or equal to 3, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two zeros (0, 0), `i` is the maximum value of the sequence list, `size` is `i + 1`, and `value` is `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`**
