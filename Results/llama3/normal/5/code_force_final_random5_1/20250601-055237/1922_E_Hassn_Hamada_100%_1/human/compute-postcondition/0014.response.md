Postcondition: **number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + size)) - (1 << i), sequence is a list of integers that must have a maximum value greater than -1, size_overlap is a tuple containing two zeros (0, 0), i is the maximum value of the sequence list, size is the minimum value such that (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number, value is (1 << size) - (1 << i), and the current value of value is less than or equal to number.**
