Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem states that Nikita can either put exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move. Therefore, after n moves, the resulting tower can have at most n cubes. The program checks if n is greater than or equal to m, which is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
