Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if n is even and m is odd, the program will print 'No', but it is actually possible to obtain a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower (n/2) times and then removing 1 cube from the top of the tower (n/2) times.

In the given program, the condition `if n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to obtain a tower with m cubes. The program should also consider the parity of n and m. If n is even and m is odd, or if n is odd and m is even, it is not possible to obtain a tower with m cubes. 

A correct solution would be to check if the difference between n and m is even. If it is, then it is possible to obtain a tower with m cubes. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This program correctly determines if it is possible to obtain a tower with m cubes after n moves.
