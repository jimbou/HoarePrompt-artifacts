Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program checks if n is greater than or equal to m. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee the possibility of having a tower with m cubes after n moves. The correct condition should be that the difference between n and m is even. This is because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to reach the desired height.

For example, if n = 5 and m = 3, the program will print 'Yes', but it's not possible to have a tower with 3 cubes after 5 moves. Nikita can add 2 cubes and then remove 1 cube to reach a height of 1, but he cannot reach a height of 3.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
