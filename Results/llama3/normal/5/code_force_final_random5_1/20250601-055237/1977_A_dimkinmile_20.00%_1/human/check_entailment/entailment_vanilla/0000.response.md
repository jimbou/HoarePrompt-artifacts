Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining if it's possible to build a tower with a certain number of cubes after a certain number of moves. The program takes the number of test cases as input, then for each test case, it takes two integers n and m as input, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

The program then checks if the number of moves (n) is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes (m). If this condition is true, it prints "Yes", indicating that it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints "No".

However, this logic is incorrect. The correct logic should be that if the difference between n and m is even, then it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. This is because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs, so the number of moves must be even to end up with an odd number of cubes.

For example, in the second test case, n = 2 and m = 4. The program prints "No", but it's actually possible to build a tower with 4 cubes after 2 moves (by adding 2 cubes and then removing none).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
