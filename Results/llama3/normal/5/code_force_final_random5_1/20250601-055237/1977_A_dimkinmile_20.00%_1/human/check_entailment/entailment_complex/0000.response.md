Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The given program checks if n is greater than or equal to m and prints 'Yes' if true, and 'No' otherwise. This logic is correct because if n is greater than or equal to m, it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes by putting m cubes on top of the tower in m moves, and then removing n-m cubes in the remaining n-m moves.

However, if n is less than m, it's not possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes because Nikita can't put more cubes than the number of moves he has.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
