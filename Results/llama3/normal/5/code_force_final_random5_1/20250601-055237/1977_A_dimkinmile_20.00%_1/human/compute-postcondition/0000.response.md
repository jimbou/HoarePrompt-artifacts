The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` accepts two integers from the input, converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). After executing the code, the first line of stdin is consumed, leaving t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). The values of n and m are now integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**
