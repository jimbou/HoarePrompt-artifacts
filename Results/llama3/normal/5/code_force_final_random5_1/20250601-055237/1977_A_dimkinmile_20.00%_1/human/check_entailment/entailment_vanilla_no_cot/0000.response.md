Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not check if the difference between n and m is even. According to the problem description, Nikita can either put exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower. Therefore, the difference between the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) must be even.

For example, if n = 5 and m = 3, the program will print 'Yes', but it is actually 'No' because Nikita cannot end up with 3 cubes after 5 moves.
