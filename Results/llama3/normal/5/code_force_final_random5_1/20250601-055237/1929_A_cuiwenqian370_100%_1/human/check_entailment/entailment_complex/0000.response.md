Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

Function 1 sorts the input array in ascending order and calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is the correct approach to find the maximum beauty of the array, as it ensures that the differences are always positive and maximized.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It applies Function 1 to each list of integers in the input and prints the results. This is the correct way to handle the input and output for the problem.

Since both functions are correct and work together to solve the problem, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
