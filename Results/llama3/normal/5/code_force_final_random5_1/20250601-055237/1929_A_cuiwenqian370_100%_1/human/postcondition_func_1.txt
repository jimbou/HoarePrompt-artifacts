The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It takes no arguments and returns no value. The input is expected to be in a specific format, where the first line contains an integer t, followed by t lines, each containing an integer n and n non-negative integers. The function processes each line of input, applies the func_1 function to the list of integers, and appends the result to a list. After processing all input, it prints each result in the list. The function modifies the state of the program by emptying the standard input buffer and printing the results to the console.
