Output State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be at least 2, index is incremented by 2n + 1, results is a list containing two elements which are the results of func_1(array) for two different arrays, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `array` has been updated to a new list of `n` non-negative integers, which were read from the `data` list starting from the index `index`. The value of `index` has been incremented by `2n + 1` to point to the next set of data. The `results` list now contains two elements, each being the result of calling `func_1` on the two different arrays. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `stdin` remains empty.
