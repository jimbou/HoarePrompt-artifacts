To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and understand how the variables in it are updated.

The loop head is `for result in results:`. The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which is an element of the `results` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is the first element in the list, and it is being printed. For the loop to execute again, `result` needs to be updated to the next element in the `results` list.

Since `results` is a list containing at least 1 element, we can assume that it has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `result` should be updated to the second element in the list.

The other variables in the state, such as `array`, `t`, `index`, `stdin`, and `results`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be updated.

State: **`array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` is 0, `index` is incremented by tn + t, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the second element in the list**
