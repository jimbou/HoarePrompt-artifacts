Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is 0, index is incremented by tn + t, results is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is 0, index is incremented by tn + t, results is a list containing at least 1 element which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays, stdin is empty, result is the first element in the list, and the result which is the first element in the list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` is 0, `index` is incremented by tn + t, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the second element in the list, and the second element in the list `results` which is the result of func_1(array) for a different array is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` is 0, `index` is incremented by tn + t, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the third element in the list, and the third element of the list results which is the result of func_1(array) for the third array is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
