The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be greater than 1.
State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be at least 2, index is incremented by n + 1, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(array), stdin is empty**
