Output State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is 0, index is incremented by tn + t, results is an empty list, stdin is empty, and all elements in the list results have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `results` is empty because all its elements have been printed, and the other variables remain unchanged.
