This function calculates and returns the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list of integers. The input list is expected to contain integers between 1 and 10^9. The function sorts the list in ascending order, then iterates through the sorted list to calculate the sum of absolute differences between adjacent elements. The final result is the total sum of these absolute differences.
