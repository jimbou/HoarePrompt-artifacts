The code prints the first element in the list `results`.
Since the exact `results` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the first element. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first element of the `results` list.
Output: **the first element of the results list (which is the result of func_1(array) for the first array)**
