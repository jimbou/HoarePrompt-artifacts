Based on the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the third element in the `results` list.

The `results` list contains the results of `func_1(array)` for `t` different arrays. Since `t` is 0, it means that `func_1(array)` has been called only once, and the result of that call is stored in the `results` list.

The `index` variable is incremented by `tn + t`, but since `t` is 0, the increment is only `tn`, which means the index is incremented by the length of the `array` list.

However, the value of `index` is not used in the `print(result)` statement. The statement only prints the third element of the `results` list, which is the result of the `func_1(array)` call.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the `func_1(array)` call for the original `array` list.

Output: **the result of func_1(array) for the original array list**
