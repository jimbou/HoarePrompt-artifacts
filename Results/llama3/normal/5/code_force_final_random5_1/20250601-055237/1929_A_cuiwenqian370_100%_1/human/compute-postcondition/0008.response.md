According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results. If the results list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the results list contains t elements which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays. So for the loop to be executed, the results list must have at least 1 element and the result is the first element in the list.
State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is 0, index is incremented by tn + t, results is a list containing at least 1 element which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays, stdin is empty, result is the first element in the list**
