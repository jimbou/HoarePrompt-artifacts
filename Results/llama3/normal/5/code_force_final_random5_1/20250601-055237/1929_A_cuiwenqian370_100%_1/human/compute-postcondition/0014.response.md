To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for result in results:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and `result` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider the state of `results` and `result`. Since `result` is the second element in the list, for the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the list `results` after the second element. Therefore, `results` must have at least 3 elements.

The state of `result` needs to be adjusted to be the next element in the list `results`, which is the third element.

The other variables `array`, `t`, `index`, `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` is 0, `index` is incremented by tn + t, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the third element in the list**
