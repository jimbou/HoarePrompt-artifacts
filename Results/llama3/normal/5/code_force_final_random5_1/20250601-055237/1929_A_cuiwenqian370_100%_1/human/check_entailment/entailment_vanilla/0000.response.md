Reasoning:

1. The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements in any way. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

2. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes an array as input, sorts it, and calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the absolute differences between adjacent elements.

3. func_2 reads input from the standard input, parses it, and calls func_1 for each test case. It then prints the results.

4. The key insight to solve this problem is to realize that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by arranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements, and the largest difference will be obtained when the smallest element is subtracted from the largest element, the second smallest element is subtracted from the second largest element, and so on.

5. The given program correctly implements this insight by sorting the array in ascending order before calculating its beauty.

6. The program also correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results for each test case.

7. There are no obvious errors or edge cases that the program does not handle correctly.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the given program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
