Output State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is 0, index is incremented by tn + t, results is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) for t different arrays, stdin is empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be as follows:

* The array will still be a list of n non-negative integers.
* The value of t will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
* The index will have been incremented by tn + t, where tn is the total number of elements processed in all iterations and t is the number of iterations.
* The results list will contain t elements, each of which is the result of func_1(array) for a different array.
* The stdin will still be empty, as it was not affected by the loop.
