Output State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be at least 1, index is incremented by n + 1, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(array), stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of `array` is updated to a list of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is the value read from `data` at the current `index`. The `index` is incremented by `n + 1` to point to the next set of data. The `results` list now contains one element, which is the result of applying the `func_1` function to the updated `array`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `stdin` remains empty.
