Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the elements in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the array has only two elements, the program correctly returns the absolute difference between the two elements.
* When the array has more than two elements, the program correctly sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
* When the array contains duplicate elements, the program correctly handles them by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
* When the array contains negative numbers, the program correctly handles them by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
