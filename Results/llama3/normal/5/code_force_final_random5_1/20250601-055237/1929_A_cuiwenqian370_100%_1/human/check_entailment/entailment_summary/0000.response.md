Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list of integers. This function correctly implements the beauty calculation as described in the problem.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It applies `func_1` to each list of integers in the input and prints the results.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by sorting the array in ascending order. This is because the beauty calculation involves subtracting each element from the previous one, and sorting the array ensures that the differences are maximized.

Since `func_1` sorts the array before calculating the beauty, and `func_2` applies `func_1` to each input array, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of each array.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
