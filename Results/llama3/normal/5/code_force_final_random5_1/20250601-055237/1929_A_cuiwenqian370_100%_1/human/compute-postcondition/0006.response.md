Output State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be at least 1, index is incremented by 2n + 2, results is a list containing three elements which are the results of func_1(array) for three different arrays**

Explanation:

* The first line assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`. Since `index` is incremented by 2n + 1, `index` becomes 2n + 2.
* The second line increments `index` by 1, making it 2n + 3.
* The third line assigns a list of n non-negative integers from `data[index:index + n]` to `array`. Since `index` is now 2n + 3, `array` is a list of n non-negative integers.
* The fourth line increments `index` by n, making it 3n + 3.
* The fifth line assigns the result of `func_1(array)` to `result`.
* The sixth line appends `result` to the `results` list, which now contains three elements: the results of `func_1(array)` for three different arrays.

Note that the value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` remains empty, as it was initially empty.
