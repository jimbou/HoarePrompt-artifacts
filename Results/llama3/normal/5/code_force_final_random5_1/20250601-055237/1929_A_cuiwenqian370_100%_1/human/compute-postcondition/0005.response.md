To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the range of `t` is not exhausted. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to worry about its state.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 2, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since the range function generates numbers from 0 to t-1). Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`array`, `index`, `results`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be at least 1, index is incremented by 2n + 1, results is a list containing two elements which are the results of func_1(array) for two different arrays, stdin is empty**
