The code prints the second element in the list `results`, which contains the results of `func_1(array)` for `t` different arrays. Since `t` is 0, `func_1(array)` is called for the same array `array` for all `t` iterations. Therefore, the second element in the list `results` is the result of `func_1(array)` for the same array `array`.

Output: **the second element in the list results (which is the result of func_1(array) for the same array array)**
