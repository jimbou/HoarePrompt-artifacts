To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **array is a list of non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be at least 1, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**
