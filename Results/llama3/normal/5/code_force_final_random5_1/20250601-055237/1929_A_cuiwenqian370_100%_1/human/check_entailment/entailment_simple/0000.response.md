Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because it maximizes the beauty of the array by placing the smallest element first and the largest element last, thus maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, sorts it, and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. `func_2` reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, the length of each array, and the elements of each array from the standard input. It then prints the maximum beauty of each array on a separate line.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
