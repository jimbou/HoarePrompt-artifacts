Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the third element into [4, 5, 67] because it only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10. However, in this case, the third element is greater than 10 and can be split, but the program does not do so.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem description, and it does not always produce the correct output.
