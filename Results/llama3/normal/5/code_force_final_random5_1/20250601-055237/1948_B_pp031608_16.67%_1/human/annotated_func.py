#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 99.
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 99 is sorted in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if a list of non-negative integers (less than or equal to 99) is sorted in ascending order and returns a boolean result indicating whether the list is sorted or not.
