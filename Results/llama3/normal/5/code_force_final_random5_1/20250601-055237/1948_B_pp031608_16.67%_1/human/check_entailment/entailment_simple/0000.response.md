Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the list is sorted after the first iteration of the outer loop. If the list is not sorted after the first iteration, the program will print 'No', even if the list can be sorted with further iterations.

The program should continue to check and modify the list until it is sorted or it is determined that the list cannot be sorted. However, the current implementation does not allow for this.

Moreover, the function func_1 is not defined in the given code snippet. It is assumed that it is defined elsewhere in the code and it checks if the list is sorted. If not, the program will not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
