Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by applying the operation of splitting an element into its digits and inserting them into the list.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted. The function works by comparing the sorted list with the original list. If they are equal, it means the list is sorted.

The main part of the program iterates over the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, and the current element is greater than 10, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them into the list.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and splits it if necessary. But it does not check if the newly inserted digits are in the correct order. For example, if the current element is 45 and the next element is 3, the program will split 45 into 4 and 5, but it will not check if 5 is greater than 3.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
