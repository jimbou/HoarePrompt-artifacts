Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by applying a specific operation. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If this condition is met and the current element is greater than 10, it applies the operation by splitting the current element into its digits and inserting them into the list.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted, but it does not consider the possibility of applying the operation to the current element. The program only applies the operation if the current element is greater than the next element, but it does not check if applying the operation would make the list sorted.

For example, consider the list `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will not apply the operation to the first element (12) because it is not greater than the next element (3). However, applying the operation to the first element would result in the list `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible applications of the operation.

Correctness: **False**
