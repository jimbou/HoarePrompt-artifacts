Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 99, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 99 in ascending order.**

In this output state, the original list `lst` remains unchanged, and a new list `sorted_lst` is created, which contains the same elements as `lst` but in sorted order from smallest to largest. The elements in `sorted_lst` are still non-negative integers less than or equal to 99, as they were in the original list `lst`.
