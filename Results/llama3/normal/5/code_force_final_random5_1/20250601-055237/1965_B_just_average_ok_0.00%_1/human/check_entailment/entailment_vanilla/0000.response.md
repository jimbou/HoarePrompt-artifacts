Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, but for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, which represent the parameters of the problem.
3. The program initializes a list `nums` with 24 elements, each of which is a power of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^23). This list represents the initial sequence of non-negative integers.
4. The program then finds the index `idx` of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k. This is done by incrementing `idx` until 2^idx is greater than k, and then decrementing `idx` by 1.
5. The program appends three new elements to the `nums` list:
	* `k - nums[idx]`: This element is chosen such that when added to `nums[idx]`, it sums up to k. However, since we want to avoid having a subsequence with a sum of k, we add this element to the list instead of `nums[idx]`.
	* `k + 1`: This element is added to ensure that there is a subsequence with a sum of k + 1.
	* `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This element is added to ensure that there is a subsequence with a sum of k + nums[idx] + 1.
6. The program removes the element `1 << idx` from the `nums` list, which is the power of 2 that was used to calculate the previous elements.
7. Finally, the program prints the length of the `nums` list and its elements.

The program's logic is based on the idea of using powers of 2 to construct the sequence, which allows it to efficiently cover all possible sums from 1 to n. By carefully choosing the elements to add and remove from the list, the program ensures that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, while still covering all other possible sums.
