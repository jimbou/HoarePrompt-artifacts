Output State: **nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^2 to 2^24, idx is 23, n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains no inputs.**

Explanation:

The first line decrements `idx` by 1, making it 23. The second line appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`, which is equivalent to appending `k - 2^23` to `nums`. The third line appends `k + 1` to `nums`. The fourth line removes `1 << idx` from `nums`, which is equivalent to removing `2^23` from `nums`.

Since `nums` initially contained powers of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, the removal of `2^23` shifts all the remaining elements down by one position, making the list contain powers of 2 from 2^2 to 2^23. The append operations add two new elements to the end of the list, making it a list of 24 elements again.

The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, as it still contains no inputs.
