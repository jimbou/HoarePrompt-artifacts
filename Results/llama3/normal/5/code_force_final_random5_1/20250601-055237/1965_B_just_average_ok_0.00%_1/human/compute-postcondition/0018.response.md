The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 0, so the new value of `idx` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `stdin` contains no inputs.
