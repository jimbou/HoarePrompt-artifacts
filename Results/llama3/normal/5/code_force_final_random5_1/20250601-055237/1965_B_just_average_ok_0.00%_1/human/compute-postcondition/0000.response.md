The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If the input() is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n). So for the loop to be executed  the input() is at least 1 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, input() is at least 1**
