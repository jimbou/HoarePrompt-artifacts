The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `idx`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. `k` being greater than or equal to 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 3` (which is 8). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 8**
