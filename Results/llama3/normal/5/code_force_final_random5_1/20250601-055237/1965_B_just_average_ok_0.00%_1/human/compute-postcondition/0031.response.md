Output State: **nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, idx is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin is empty**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This empties stdin. The second line reassigns `nums` to be a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23. The third line sets `idx` to 0. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values, but their exact values are not specified. The initial values of `nums` and `idx` are overwritten by the code.
