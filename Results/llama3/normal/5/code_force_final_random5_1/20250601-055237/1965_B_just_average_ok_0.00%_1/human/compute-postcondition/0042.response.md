The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements in the `nums` list.

Based on the initial state, the `nums` list contains 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, and three additional elements: k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1.

Since the exact value of k is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the last three elements in the list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output all 27 elements in the `nums` list.

Output: **2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^23, k - 2^23, k + 1, k + 2^23 + 1 (where k is the value of k)**
