Output State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is 3, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, `stdin` contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged, with `nums` still being a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `n` being an integer, `k` being greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, and `stdin` containing no inputs.
