Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, idx is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains no inputs
Code of the loop:
while k >= 1 << idx:
    idx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `stdin` contains no inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is 3, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, `stdin` contains no inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is less than or equal to 3 or `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, `stdin` contains no inputs.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
