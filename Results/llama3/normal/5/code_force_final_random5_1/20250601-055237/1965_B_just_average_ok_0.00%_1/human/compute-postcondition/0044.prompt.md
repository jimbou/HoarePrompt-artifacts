Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
    idx = 0
    while k >= 1 << idx:
        idx += 1
    idx -= 1
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: nums is a list of 25 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23 and three additional elements: k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1, idx is 23, and the length of the list nums which is 25 is being printed, and all elements of the list nums are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^2 to 2^24, idx is 23, n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains no inputs, and the length of the list nums which is 24 is being printed, and all the elements of the list nums are being printed which are the powers of 2 from 2^2 to 2^24

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, and three additional elements: k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1, idx is 23, n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin is empty, and the length of the list nums which is 27 is being printed, and the list nums is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
