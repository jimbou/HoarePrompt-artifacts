Output State: **nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, idx is 24, k must be greater than or equal to 2^24.**

The loop will continue to execute until `k` is less than `1 << idx`. Since `idx` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute 24 times, until `idx` is 24. At this point, `k` must be greater than or equal to `2^24` for the loop to have executed 24 times. The state of `nums` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
