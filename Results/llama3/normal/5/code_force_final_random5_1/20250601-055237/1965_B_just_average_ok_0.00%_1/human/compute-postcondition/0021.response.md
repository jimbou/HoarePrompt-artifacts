The variable in the loop head is variable k and idx. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and idx. If k is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by idx, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, and idx is 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, idx must be less than or equal to 2, or k must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3.
State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is less than or equal to 2 or `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, `stdin` contains no inputs.**
