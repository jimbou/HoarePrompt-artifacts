Output State: **nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, and three additional elements: k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1, idx is 23, n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin is empty, and the length of the list nums which is 27 is being printed, and the list nums is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will continue to execute until there are no more inputs in stdin, at which point it will terminate. The final output state will include the list nums with 27 elements (24 powers of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, and three additional elements: k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1), the index idx will be 23, n and k will be integers, stdin will be empty, and the length of the list nums (27) and the list nums itself will be printed.
