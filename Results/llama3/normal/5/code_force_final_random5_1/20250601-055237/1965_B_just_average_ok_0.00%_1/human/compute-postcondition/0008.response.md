Output State: `nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is 24, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2^24.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `nums` remains unchanged, still containing 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23. The variable `idx` has incremented to 24, indicating that the loop has executed 24 times. The variable `k` must be greater than or equal to 2^24, which is the condition that allows the loop to execute 24 times.
