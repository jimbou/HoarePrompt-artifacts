To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`


The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that doesn't affect the loop's execution. The loop's execution depends on the `range` object, which is created from the `int(input())` expression.


At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains no inputs. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more input.


State: **nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^2 to 2^24, idx is 23, n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains at least one input**
