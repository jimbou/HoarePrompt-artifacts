Output State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is less than 4, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than 4. The other variables remain unchanged, with `nums` still being a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `n` being an integer, `k` being greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3, and `stdin` being empty.
