The only variable in the loop head is variable k and idx, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables k and idx.  If k is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by idx, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time k needed to have been greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3 and idx currently must be less than 3.
State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is less than 3, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3, `stdin` is empty**
