The variable in the loop head is variable k and idx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and idx.  If k is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by idx, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is greater than or equal to 1 and idx is 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time k must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2.
State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, `stdin` contains no inputs.**
