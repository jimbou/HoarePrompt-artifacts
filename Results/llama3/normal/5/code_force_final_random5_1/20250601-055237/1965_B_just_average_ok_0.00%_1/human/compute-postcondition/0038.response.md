Output State: **nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, idx is 24, n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `nums` remains unchanged, with each element being a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23. The variable `idx` has been incremented to 24, indicating that the loop has executed 24 times. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The `stdin` remains empty, as it was initially.
