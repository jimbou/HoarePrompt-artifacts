Output State: **nums is a list of 25 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23 and three additional elements: k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1, idx is 23**

The code modifies the initial state by decrementing the value of `idx` by 1, making it 23. It then appends three new elements to the `nums` list: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Since `idx` is now 23, `nums[idx]` is equal to 2^23. Therefore, the three new elements are `k - 2^23`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^23 + 1`. 

The code also removes the element `1 << idx` from the `nums` list, which is equivalent to removing the element at index 23, which is 2^23. As a result, the `nums` list now contains 25 elements: the original 24 elements (powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23), minus the removed element 2^23, plus the three newly appended elements.
