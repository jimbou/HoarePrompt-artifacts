The variables in the loop head are k and idx, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables k and idx. If k is greater than or equal to 1 << idx, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is greater than or equal to 1, and idx is 1. For the loop to execute again, k must be greater than or equal to 1 << 1, which is 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**
