This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of 24 elements representing powers of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, and then appends three additional elements: k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1. The function then prints the length of the resulting list (which is always 27) and the list itself. The function does not modify the input values n and k, and it does not use the value of n in any way. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not include any error checking.
