Output State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of `nums` and `k` remain unchanged. The list `nums` still contains 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, and `k` is still greater than or equal to 1.
