Output State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `nums` still contains 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23. The value of `n` is still an integer, and `k` is still greater than or equal to 1. The `stdin` remains empty.
