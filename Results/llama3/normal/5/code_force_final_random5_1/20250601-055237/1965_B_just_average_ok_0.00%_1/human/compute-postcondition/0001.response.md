The first line reads an integer `t` from stdin, which is not used anywhere in the code. The second line reads two integers `n` and `k` from stdin, which are also not used anywhere in the code. The third line creates a list `nums` containing 24 elements, each of which is a power of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^23). The fourth line initializes a variable `idx` to 0.

Since `t`, `n`, and `k` are not used anywhere in the code, their values do not affect the final state. The only variables that are modified are `nums` and `idx`.

Output State: **nums is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, idx is 0**
