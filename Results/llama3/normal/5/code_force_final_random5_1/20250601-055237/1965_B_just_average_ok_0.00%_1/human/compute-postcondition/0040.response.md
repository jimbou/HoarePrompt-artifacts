To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

The initial state describes `nums` as a list containing 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, and three additional elements: k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1. It also mentions `idx` as 23, `n` as an integer, `k` as an integer, and `stdin` as empty.

The Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement: `print(len(nums))`.

Here, `len(nums)` is a function that returns the number of elements in the `nums` list.

Based on the initial state, `nums` has 24 elements (powers of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23) and three additional elements (k - 2^23, k + 1, and k + 2^23 + 1). Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is 24 + 3 = 27.

So, when the `print` statement executes, it will print the length of the `nums` list, which is 27.

Output: **27**
