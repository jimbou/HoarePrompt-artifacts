Output State: `nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is 24, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `stdin` contains no inputs.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `nums` remains unchanged, `idx` is now 24, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still an integer, and `stdin` still contains no inputs.
