The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The value of `idx` was 1, so the new value of `idx` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, `idx` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
