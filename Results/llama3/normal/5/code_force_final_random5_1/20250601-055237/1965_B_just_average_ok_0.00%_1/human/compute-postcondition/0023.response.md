Output State: `nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is less than or equal to 23, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `stdin` contains no inputs.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `nums` remains unchanged, containing powers of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23. The variable `idx` will be less than or equal to 23, indicating that the loop has iterated at most 23 times. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as integers, and the standard input `stdin` still contains no inputs.
