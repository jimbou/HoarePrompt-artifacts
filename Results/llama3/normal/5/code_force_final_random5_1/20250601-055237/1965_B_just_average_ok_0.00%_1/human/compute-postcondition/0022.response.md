Output State: **`nums` is a list of 24 elements, each a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23, `idx` is less than or equal to 3 or `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, `stdin` contains no inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `nums` remains unchanged with 24 elements, each being a power of 2 from 2^1 to 2^23. The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to 3. The condition on `k` remains the same, it must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 3 if `idx` is greater than 2, otherwise, it must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2. The value of `n` is still an integer, and there are no inputs in `stdin`.
