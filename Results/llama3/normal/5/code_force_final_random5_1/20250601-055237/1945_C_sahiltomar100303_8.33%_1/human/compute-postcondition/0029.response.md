Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid + 2, leftZero is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), rightZero is 2 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 1, leftOne is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), rightOne is 0 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 1, tleftZero is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), trightZero is 2 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 1, tleftOne is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), trightOne is 0 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

The final state reflects the changes made by the code snippet. The variables `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1, resulting in their new values. The other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
