Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is less than `n` and increased by 1, `n` is greater than `2 * trightOne + right` or `2 * trightOne + right + 1`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid` plus 3, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right - 1`, and `trightZero` is less than `trightOne - 2`. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid` plus 2, `tleftOne` is less than half of `mid` plus 2, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right - 2`. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid` plus 2, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right - 1`, and `trightZero` is less than `trightOne - 1`. `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been increased by 1, and the conditions for `n`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `trightZero` have been updated accordingly. The value of `left` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `tleftOne` are still valid.
