Output State: **left and right are printed based on the conditions of left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne, i is mid + 1, n is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no inputs, _ is 1, t is greater than 1, rightZero is increased by 1, trightZero is increased by 1.**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
