Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0 and less than `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is either one less than its original value or remains the same, `rightZero` is either one more than its original value or remains the same, `leftOne` is either one less than its original value or remains the same, `rightOne` is either one more than its original value or remains the same, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**
