Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than 0 and less than n-1, i is equal to n, leftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, leftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, left is greater than 0, leftMove is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then leftZero is one less than its original value, rightZero is one more than its original value, leftOne remains the same, and rightOne remains the same. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is not '0', then leftZero remains the same, rightZero remains the same, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value.***
