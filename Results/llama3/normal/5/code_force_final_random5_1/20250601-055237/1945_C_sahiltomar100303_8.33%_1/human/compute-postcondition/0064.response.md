Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than (right + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `rightOne` is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, `right` is equal to mid + 2, `mid` is less than n - 1. If the character at index right in string s is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `rightZero` is one less than its original value. If the character at index right in string s is not '0', then `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `rightOne` is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `mid + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships with `right` have been updated accordingly. The conditions related to the character at index `right` in string `s` are still valid, but now they refer to the new value of `right`.
