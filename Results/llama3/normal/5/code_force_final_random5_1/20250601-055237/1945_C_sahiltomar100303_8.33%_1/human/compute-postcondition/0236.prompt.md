Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is `mid`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, n is greater than mid. If s[i] is '0', then i is the index of a '0' character in s, leftZero and tleftZero are the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one, rightZero and trightZero are 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne and trightOne are 0. If s[i] is not '0', then i is mid, leftZero and tleftZero are the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero and trightZero are 0, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne and trightOne are 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, n is greater than mid + 1. If s[i] is '0', then i is the index of a '0' character in s, leftZero and tleftZero are the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus one, trightZero is 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne and trightOne are 0. If s[i] is not '0', then i is mid + 1, leftZero and tleftZero are the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero and trightZero are 0, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne and trightOne are 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `n` is greater than `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus two, `trightZero` is 3, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, and `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, `trightOne` is 3, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', or the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` if `s[i]` is not '0', `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', or the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` if `s[i]` is not '0', `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', or 0 if `s[i]` is not '0', `trightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', or 0 if `s[i]` is not '0', `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, and `i` is the index of a '0' character in `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', or `mid + 2` if `s[i]` is not '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
