Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `n` is greater than `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus two, `trightZero` is 3, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, and `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, `trightOne` is 3, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', or the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` if `s[i]` is not '0', `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', or the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` if `s[i]` is not '0', `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', or 0 if `s[i]` is not '0', `trightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', or 0 if `s[i]` is not '0', `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, and `i` is the index of a '0' character in `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', or `mid + 2` if `s[i]` is not '0'.**
