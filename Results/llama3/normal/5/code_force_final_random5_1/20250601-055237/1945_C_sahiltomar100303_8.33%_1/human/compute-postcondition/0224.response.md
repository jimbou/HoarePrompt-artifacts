Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, i is the index of a '0' character in s, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one, rightZero is 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 1, trightOne is 0, and n is greater than mid.**

The code increments `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was initially 0, it becomes 1. Similarly, `trightZero` also becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
