Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `right` is equal to `mid`
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `right` is equal to `mid + 1` and `mid` must be less than `n`. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `rightZero` is one less than its original value. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `rightOne` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than (right + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `rightOne` is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, `right` is equal to mid + 2, `mid` is less than n - 1. If the character at index right in string s is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `rightZero` is one less than its original value. If the character at index right in string s is not '0', then `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `rightOne` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, and the conditions for updating `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` still depend on the character at the right index of string `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
