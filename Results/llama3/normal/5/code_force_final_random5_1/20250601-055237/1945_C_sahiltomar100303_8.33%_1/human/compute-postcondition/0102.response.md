Postcondition: ***`left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`. If `left` is 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed if `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise the value of `left` is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of either `left` or `right` is printed, depending on which one has an absolute difference with `(n + 1) // 2` that is less than or equal to the other's absolute difference with `(n + 1) // 2.***
