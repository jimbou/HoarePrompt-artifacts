The code prints the value of `left` which is not equal to 0 and is such that the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.
Output: **left (where left is the value of left that is not equal to 0 and is closer to (n + 1) // 2 than right)**
