The code snippet increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` is initially 1, it becomes 2. Similarly, `tleftZero` is initially 1, so it also becomes 2. No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than 1, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, i is 1, leftZero is 2, tleftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0**
