Postcondition: ***`left` is not equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than (right + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1. If `right` is equal to n, the value of `right` which is equal to n is being printed if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, otherwise the value of `left` is being printed. If `right` is not equal to n, the value of either `left` or `right` is being printed, depending on which one has an absolute difference with `(n + 1) // 2` that is less than or equal to the other's absolute difference with `(n + 1) // 2.***
