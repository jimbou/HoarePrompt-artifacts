Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left is mid, leftMove is 0, right and rightZero and rightOne and trightZero and trightOne are printed based on the conditions of left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne, i is n, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no inputs, _ is 1, t is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0, `right`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value and `rightZero` is one more than its original value. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0, `right`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, either `leftZero` is less than `left // 2` or `rightOne` is less than `(n - left) // 2`. If `s[left]` is '0', `leftZero` is one less than its original value and `rightZero` is one more than its original value. If `s[left]` is not '0', `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0, `right`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If `s[left]` is '0', either `leftZero` is less than `(left // 2) - 1` or `rightOne` is less than `(n - left) // 2`, and if `s[left + 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is two less than its original value and `rightZero` is two more than its original value. If `s[left + 1]` is not '0', `leftOne` is two less than its original value and `rightOne` is two more than its original value. If `s[left]` is not '0', either `leftZero` is less than `left // 2` or `rightOne` is less than `(n - left) // 2`, and if `s[left + 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is one less than its original value and `rightZero` is one more than its original value. If `s[left + 1]` is not '0', `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
