Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than (right + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1. If `right` is not equal to n, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to n, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to n is printed.***
