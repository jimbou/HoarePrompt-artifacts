The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and mid, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `mid` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 2, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 1.**
