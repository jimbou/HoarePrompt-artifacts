To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `mid`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `mid` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `mid` must be greater than 1.

State: **`left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0'. In both cases, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 1, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `i` is 1**
