Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is one more than its original value, rightZero is one less than its original value, leftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightOne is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, right is equal to mid + 1, mid is less than n - 1**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `right`, and `mid` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `rightZero` is decremented by 1. The relationship between `mid` and `n` is preserved, as `mid` is still less than `n - 1`.
