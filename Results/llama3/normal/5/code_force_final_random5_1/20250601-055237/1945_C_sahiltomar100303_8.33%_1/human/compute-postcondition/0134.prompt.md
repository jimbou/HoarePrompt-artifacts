Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left and right are printed based on the conditions of left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are increased by mid, and leftOne and tleftOne are increased by mid. Otherwise, left is printed based on the conditions of left and right, and leftOne and tleftOne are increased by mid. In both cases, _ is 1, t is greater than 1, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than or equal to 0, rightZero and trightZero are 0, rightOne and trightOne are 0, stdin contains no inputs, and i is mid - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`, `i` is `mid`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are set to 1, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` are set to 0. Otherwise, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are set to 0, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` are set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *left and right are printed based on the conditions of left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne, i is mid + 1, n is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no inputs, _ is 1, t is greater than 1. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are increased by 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: left and right are printed based on the conditions of left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne, i is mid + 2, n is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no inputs, _ is 1, t is greater than 1. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are increased by 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
