Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, t is greater than 1, i is n, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is mid, leftMove is 0
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `left` equals `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1`. If the character at index `left` of `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1` plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `left` equals `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `mid - 2` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid - 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 2, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1`. If the character at index `mid - 2` of `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1` plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `left` is greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `mid - 2` of `s` is '0', then if the character at index `left` of `s` is '0', `leftZero` is less than half of `mid - 1` and less than `left // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 3, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1` and less than `(n - left) // 2`. If the character at index `left` of `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid - 1` and less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 2, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1` and less than `(n - left) // 2`. If the character at index `mid - 2` of `s` is not '0', then if the character at index `left` of `s` is '0', `leftZero` is less than half of `mid` and less than `left // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 2, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1` plus 1 and less than `(n - left) // 2`. If the character at index `left` of `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid` and less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1` plus 1 and less than `(n - left) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
