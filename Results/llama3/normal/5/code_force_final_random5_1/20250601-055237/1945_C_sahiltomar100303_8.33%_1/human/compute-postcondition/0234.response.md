Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, n is greater than mid + 2, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus one, trightOne is 3, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one if s[i] is '0', or the number of '0' characters in the first half of s if s[i] is not '0', tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one if s[i] is '0', or the number of '0' characters in the first half of s if s[i] is not '0', rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus one if s[i] is '0', or 0 if s[i] is not '0', trightZero is 2 if s[i] is '0', or 0 if s[i] is not '0', leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, i is the index of a '0' character in s plus one if s[i] is '0', or mid + 2 if s[i] is not '0'.**

The code increments the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. The value of `rightOne` becomes the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, and the value of `trightOne` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `t`, `stdin`, `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `rightZero`, `i`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged.
