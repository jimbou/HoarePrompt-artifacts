Postcondition: **The program prints `left` and `right` based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0'. In both cases, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `i` is 0.**
