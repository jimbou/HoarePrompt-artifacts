Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, t is greater than 1, i is n, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is mid, leftMove is 0**

The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left` and sets `leftMove` to 0. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `t`, `i`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
