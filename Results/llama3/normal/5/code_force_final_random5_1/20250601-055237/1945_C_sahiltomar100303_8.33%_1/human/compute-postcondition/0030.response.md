Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid + 2, leftZero is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), rightZero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, leftOne is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), rightOne is 1 if the character at index i in string s is not '0', otherwise it is 0 and increased by 1, tleftZero is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), trightZero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, tleftOne is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), trightOne is 1 if the character at index i in string s is not '0', otherwise it is 0 and increased by 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**
