Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is less than `n` and increased by 1, if `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid` plus 2, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right`, and `trightZero` is less than `trightOne - 1`. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid` plus 1, `tleftOne` is less than half of `mid` plus 2, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been increased by 1, and the conditions for `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `trightZero` have been updated accordingly based on the value of `s[right]`. The values of `left` and other variables remain unchanged.
