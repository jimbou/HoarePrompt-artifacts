Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 1 or 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1 or 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. Otherwise, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0.**
