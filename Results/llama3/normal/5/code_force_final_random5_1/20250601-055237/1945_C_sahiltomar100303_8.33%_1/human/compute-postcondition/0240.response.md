Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than 0, t is greater than 1, i equals n, leftZero is less than half of mid, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus one, rightOne is less than half of n - mid + 1, left equals mid, leftMove is 0. The current value of s[left - 1] is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `leftZero` has decreased by 1, and the value of `rightZero` has increased by 1. The value of `s[left - 1]` has changed from '0' to '1'. All other variables remain unchanged.
