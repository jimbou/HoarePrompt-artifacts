The code prints the value of `right`, which is an integer that does not equal `n`. The exact value of `right` cannot be determined from the given information, but it is described as being farther away from `(n+1)/2` than `left` is.

Output: **right (where right is an integer not equal to n, and the absolute difference between (n+1)/2 and right is larger than the absolute difference between (n+1)/2 and left)**
