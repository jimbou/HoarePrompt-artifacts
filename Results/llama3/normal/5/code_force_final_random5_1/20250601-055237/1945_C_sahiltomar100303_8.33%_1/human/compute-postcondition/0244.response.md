Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `left` equals `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1`. If the character at index `left` of `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and the conditions for `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` are updated based on the new value of `left`. The other variables remain unchanged.
