Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0 and less than `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive) and is one less than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` and is one more than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive) and is one less than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` and is one more than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is equal to `mid - 1` and is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `left` is now `mid - 1`, which is still greater than 0. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and relationships.
