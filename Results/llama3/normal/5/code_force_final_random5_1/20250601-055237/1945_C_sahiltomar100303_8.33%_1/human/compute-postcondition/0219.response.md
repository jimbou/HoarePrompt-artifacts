Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than 2, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, i is 2, leftZero is either 1 or 2, tleftZero is either 1 or 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is either 2 or 1, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is either 1 or 2.**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. The initial values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` depend on the value of `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are initially 0, and after the code executes, they become 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are initially 1, and after the code executes, they become 2. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
