Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `right` is less than `n` and increased by 1. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid` plus 2, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right + 1`, and `trightZero` is less than `trightOne - 1`. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid` plus 1, `tleftOne` is less than half of `mid` plus 2, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right`.***
