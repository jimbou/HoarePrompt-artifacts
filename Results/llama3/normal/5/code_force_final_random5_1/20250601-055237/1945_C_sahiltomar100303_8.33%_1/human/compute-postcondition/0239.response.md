Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n`, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is less than half of `n - mid + 1`, `left` equals `mid`, `leftMove` is 0. The current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.***
