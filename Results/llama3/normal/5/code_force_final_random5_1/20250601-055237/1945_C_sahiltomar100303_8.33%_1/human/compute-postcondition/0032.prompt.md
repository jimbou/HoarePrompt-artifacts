Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, i is mid-1, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line. leftZero is between 0 and mid (inclusive), rightZero is 0, leftOne is between 0 and mid (inclusive), rightOne is 0, tleftZero is between 0 and mid (inclusive), trightZero is 0, tleftOne is between 0 and mid (inclusive), trightOne is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero` is between 0 and `mid` (inclusive), `rightZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `leftOne` is between 0 and `mid` (inclusive), `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `mid` (inclusive), `trightZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `mid` (inclusive), `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid + 1, leftZero is between 0 and mid + 1 (inclusive), rightZero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, leftOne is between 0 and mid + 1 (inclusive), rightOne is 1 if the character at index i in string s is not '0', otherwise it is 0, tleftZero is between 0 and mid + 1 (inclusive), trightZero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, tleftOne is between 0 and mid + 1 (inclusive), trightOne is 1 if the character at index i in string s is not '0', otherwise it is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are increased by 1. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then rightOne and trightOne are increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid + 2, leftZero is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), rightZero is 2 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 1, leftOne is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), rightOne is 0 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 1 and increased by 1, tleftZero is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), trightZero is 2 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 1, tleftOne is between 0 and mid + 2 (inclusive), trightOne is 0 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 1 and increased by 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
