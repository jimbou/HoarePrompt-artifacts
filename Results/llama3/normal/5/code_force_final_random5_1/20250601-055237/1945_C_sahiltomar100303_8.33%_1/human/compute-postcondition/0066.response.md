Output State: **tleftZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is decremented by 1**

In this code block, the first line increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1, and the second line decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `tleftZero` and `trightZero`, we can only describe the change in their values. After the code executes, `tleftZero` will have its original value plus 1, and `trightZero` will have its original value minus 1.
