Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to n, leftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, leftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the variables `rightZero` and `trightZero` will be equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, while the variables `rightOne` and `trightOne` will be equal to the number of '1' characters in the same substring. The other variables remain unchanged.
