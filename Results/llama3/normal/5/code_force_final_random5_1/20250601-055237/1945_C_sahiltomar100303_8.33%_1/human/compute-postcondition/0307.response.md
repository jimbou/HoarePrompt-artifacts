Postcondition: **right equals n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of mid plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is less than or equal to half of mid plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, trightZero is 0, and trightOne is 0. If left is 0, then if right is not equal to n, the value of right which is equal to the initial value of n is printed. If right equals n, then if the current value of rightOne is greater than or equal to half of n plus 1, divided by 2, then the value of left which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is n is printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right equals n, the value of either right or left is printed based on the condition tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2. If tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of n plus 1, the value of right which is n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left is printed. If right is not equal to n, the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to or at the same distance from the middle index ((n + 1) // 2).**
