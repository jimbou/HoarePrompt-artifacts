Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and all other variables (`rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`) are 0. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, and all other variables (`rightZero`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`) are 0.***
