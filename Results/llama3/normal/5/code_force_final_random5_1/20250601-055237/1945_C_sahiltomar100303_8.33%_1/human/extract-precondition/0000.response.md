Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 2*10^4), which is the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5), which is the number of houses. The second line of each test case contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, which represents the preferences of the residents.**
