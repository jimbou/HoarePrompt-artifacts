Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `right` (which equals `mid`) is less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `mid` plus 1, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `mid`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, and `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `mid`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `mid` plus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, and `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1.***
