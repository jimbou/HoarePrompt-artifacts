Output: **`left` is not equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than (right + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `right` is equal to n, and the current value of `right` is equal to n. Additionally, the current value of `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of `right` which is equal to n is being printed**
