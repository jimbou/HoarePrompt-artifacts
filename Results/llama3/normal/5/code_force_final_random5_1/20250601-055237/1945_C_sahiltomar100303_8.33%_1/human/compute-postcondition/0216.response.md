Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 1.***
