Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid, leftZero is between 0 and mid (inclusive), rightZero is 1, leftOne is between 0 and mid (inclusive), rightOne is 0, tleftZero is between 0 and mid (inclusive), trightZero is 1, tleftOne is between 0 and mid (inclusive), trightOne is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

The code increments the value of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since the current value of `s[i]` is '0', this means that the number of zeros to the right of the current position `i` has increased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
