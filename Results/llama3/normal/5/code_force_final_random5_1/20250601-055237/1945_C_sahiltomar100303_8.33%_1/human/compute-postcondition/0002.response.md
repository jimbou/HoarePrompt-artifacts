Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. It then reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2. The variables `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are all initialized to 0. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
