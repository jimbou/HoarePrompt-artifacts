Postcondition: **The values of `right`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `left` are updated based on the condition `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2`. If `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, the value of `right` which is `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `left` is printed. In both cases, `right` equals `n`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are 0, and `left` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are less than or equal to half of `mid` plus the number of '0' and '1' characters in the second half of `s`, respectively.**
