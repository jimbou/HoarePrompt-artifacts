Postcondition: ***right is either equal to n or not, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0. If left is 0, then if right is not equal to n, the value of right is printed. If right is equal to n, then if the number of '1' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of left which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is equal to n is printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right is equal to n and the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 (tleftZero) is greater than or equal to half of the total length of the string s (n+1)/2, then the value of right which is equal to n is being printed. Otherwise, if right is equal to n, the value of left is being printed. If right is not equal to n, the value of either left or right is printed, depending on which one has a smaller absolute difference with the middle index ((n + 1) // 2).***
