Postcondition: ***right is equal to n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0. The current value of left is 0. If the current value of rightOne is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of left which is 0 is being printed.
