Postcondition: ***`left` is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value and `rightZero` is one more than its original value. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.***
