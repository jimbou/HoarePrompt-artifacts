Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left and right are printed based on the conditions of left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, stdin contains no inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program prints `left` and `right` based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0'. In both cases, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `tleftOne` is increased by 1. In both cases, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 1, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftOne`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `stdin`, and `i` are updated based on the conditions of `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are increased by 1, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` is printed based on the conditions of `left` and `right`, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are increased by 2. In both cases, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 2, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are 0, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
