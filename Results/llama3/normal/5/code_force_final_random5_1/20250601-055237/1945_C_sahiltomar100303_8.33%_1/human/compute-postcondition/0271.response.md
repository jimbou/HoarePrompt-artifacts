Output State: **left is 0, right is less than n and increased by 1, n is greater than 2 * trightOne + right - 1 or 2 * trightOne + right, if s[right] is '0', then tleftZero is less than half of mid plus 3, trightOne is less than half of n - right, and trightZero is less than trightOne - 2. Otherwise, tleftZero is less than half of mid plus 2, tleftOne is less than half of mid plus 2, and trightOne is less than half of n - right - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1. The conditions for `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `trightZero` are updated accordingly based on the new values. The conditions for `tleftOne` remain unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
