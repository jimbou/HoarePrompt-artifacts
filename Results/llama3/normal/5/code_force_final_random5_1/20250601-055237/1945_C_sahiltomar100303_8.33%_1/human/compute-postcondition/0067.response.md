Output State: **tleftOne is incremented by 1, trightOne is decremented by 1**

The code block consists of two lines, each modifying a different variable. The first line increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1, while the second line decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. As a result, the final state reflects these changes, with `tleftOne` being one more than its original value and `trightOne` being one less than its original value.
