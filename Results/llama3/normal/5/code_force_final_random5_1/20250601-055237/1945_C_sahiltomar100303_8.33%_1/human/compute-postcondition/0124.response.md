Output State: **`left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`, `i` is `mid`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `rightZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'**

In this final state, the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` have been incremented by 1, resulting in `rightOne` being 1 and `trightOne` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
