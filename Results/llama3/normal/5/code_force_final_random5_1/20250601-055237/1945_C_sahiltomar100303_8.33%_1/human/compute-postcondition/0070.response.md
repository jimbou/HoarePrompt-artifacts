Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than (right + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `right` is equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `left` remains 0, `leftZero` and `leftOne` are less than half of the total length of the string `s` from the current `right` index to the end, `rightZero` and `rightOne` are equal to the number of '0' and '1' characters respectively in the substring of `s` from `mid` to the end of the string, and `right` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has traversed the entire string.
