Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than 1, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, i is 1, leftZero is 1, tleftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 1**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
