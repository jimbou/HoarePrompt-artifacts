Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, i is 1, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` and `tleftOne` were initially 1, they become 2. No other variables are affected.
