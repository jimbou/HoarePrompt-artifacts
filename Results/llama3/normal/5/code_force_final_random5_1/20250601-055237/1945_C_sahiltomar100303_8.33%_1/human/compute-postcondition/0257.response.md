Output State: **`left` equals 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `mid`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `mid`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, and `right` equals `mid`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged, but the value of `right` is now equal to `mid`.
