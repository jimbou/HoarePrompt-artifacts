Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to half of mid plus 1, leftOne is less than or equal to half of mid, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the first half of s minus 1, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and right (which equals mid) is less than n.**

In this final state, the value of `left` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `leftZero` has increased by 1, so it is now less than or equal to half of `mid` plus 1. The value of `leftOne` remains unchanged, still less than or equal to half of `mid`. The value of `rightZero` has decreased by 1, so it is now the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1. The value of `rightOne` remains unchanged, still the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`. The value of `right` remains unchanged, still equal to `mid` and less than `n`.
