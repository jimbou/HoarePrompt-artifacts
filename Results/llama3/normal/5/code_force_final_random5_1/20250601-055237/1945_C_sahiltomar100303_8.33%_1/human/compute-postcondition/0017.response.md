Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, i is mid-1, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line. leftZero is between 0 and mid (inclusive), rightZero is 0, leftOne is between 0 and mid (inclusive), rightOne is 0, tleftZero is between 0 and mid (inclusive), trightZero is 0, tleftOne is between 0 and mid (inclusive), trightOne is 0.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `mid-1`, and the values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` will be between 0 and `mid` (inclusive), depending on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the `mid` index. The values of `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will remain 0, as they are not updated in the loop. The other variables, `t`, `_`, `n`, and `s`, remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
