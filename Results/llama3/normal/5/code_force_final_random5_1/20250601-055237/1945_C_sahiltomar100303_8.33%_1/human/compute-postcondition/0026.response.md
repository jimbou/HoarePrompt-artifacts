Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid + 1, leftZero is between 0 and mid + 1 (inclusive), rightZero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, leftOne is between 0 and mid + 1 (inclusive), rightOne is 1 plus its original value, trightZero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, tleftOne is between 0 and mid + 1 (inclusive), trightOne is 1 plus its original value, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

In this output state, the variables `rightOne` and `trightOne` have been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `rightOne` is now 1 plus its original value, and the value of `trightOne` is also 1 plus its original value. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
