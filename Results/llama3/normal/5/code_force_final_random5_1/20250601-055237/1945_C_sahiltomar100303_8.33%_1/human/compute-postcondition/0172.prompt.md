Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left is 0, leftMove is 0, right is mid, rightZero, rightOne, trightZero, trightOne are printed based on the conditions of left, mid, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne, i is n, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no inputs, _ is 1, t is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` such that `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` and `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer and greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If the character at the right index of string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is less than or equal to `n`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` such that `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer and greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If the character at the right index of string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is less than `n` and is incremented by 1, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` such that `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 2) // 2` and `trightOne` is less than `(n - right) // 2`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer and greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If the character at the right index of string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
