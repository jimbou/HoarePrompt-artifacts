Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than 0 and less than n-1, i is equal to n, leftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive) and is one less than its original value, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1 and is one more than its original value, leftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, left is greater than 1, leftMove is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, making it one less than its original value. The second line increments `rightZero` by 1, making it one more than its original value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
