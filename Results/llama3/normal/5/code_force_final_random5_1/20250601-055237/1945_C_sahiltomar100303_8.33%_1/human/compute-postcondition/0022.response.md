Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid, leftZero is between 0 and mid (inclusive), rightZero is 0, leftOne is between 0 and mid (inclusive), rightOne is 1, tleftZero is between 0 and mid (inclusive), trightZero is 0, tleftOne is between 0 and mid (inclusive), trightOne is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line, and the character at index i in string s is not '0'**

The code increments the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was 0, it becomes 1, and since `trightOne` was also 0, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
