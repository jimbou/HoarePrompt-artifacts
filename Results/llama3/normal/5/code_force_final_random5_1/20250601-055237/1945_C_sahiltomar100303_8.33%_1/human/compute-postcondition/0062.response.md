Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1 and rightZero is one less than its original value if the character at index right in string s is '0', leftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive) and leftOne is one more than its original value if the character at index right in string s is not '0', rightOne is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, right is equal to mid + 1, mid is less than n - 1, tleftOne is one more than its original value, and trightOne is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `right`, and `mid` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet. The only changes occur in the values of `tleftOne` and `trightOne`, which are incremented and decremented by 1, respectively.
