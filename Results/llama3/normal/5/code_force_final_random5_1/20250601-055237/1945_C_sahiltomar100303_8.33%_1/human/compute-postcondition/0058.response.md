Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `leftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, `right` is equal to `mid` and `mid` must be less than `n`. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `rightZero` is one less than its original value. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `rightOne` is one less than its original value.***
