Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is less than or equal to `n`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` such that `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer and greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If the character at the right index of string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `right` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `tleftZero` and `trightOne` have also been updated to reflect the new value of `right`.
