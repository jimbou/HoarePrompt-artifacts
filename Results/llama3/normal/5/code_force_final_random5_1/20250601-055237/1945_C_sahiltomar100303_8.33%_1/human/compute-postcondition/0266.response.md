Output State: **left is 0, right is less than n and increased by 1, tleftZero is less than half of mid plus 2, trightOne is less than half of n - right + 1, trightZero is less than trightOne - 1**

The code increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was less than half of `mid` plus 1, it is now less than half of `mid` plus 2. Similarly, since `trightZero` was less than `trightOne`, it is now less than `trightOne` minus 1. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
