Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to n, leftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, leftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0 and less than `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive) and is one less than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` and is one more than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive) and is one less than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` and is one more than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is equal to `mid - 1` and is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0 and less than `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive) and is one less than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same and `leftZero` is less than (`left` + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` and is one more than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive) and is one less than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` and is one more than its original value if the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same and `rightOne` is less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is greater than 0 and less than `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is either one less than its original value or remains the same, `rightZero` is either one more than its original value or remains the same, `leftOne` is either one less than its original value or remains the same, `rightOne` is either one more than its original value or remains the same, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
