Output State: **left is equal to 0, leftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, leftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable "left" is equal to 0, indicating that the loop has finished iterating. The variables "leftZero" and "rightZero" represent the number of '0' characters in the substring of "s" from index "mid" to "n-1", and their values are updated accordingly based on the characters in the substring. Similarly, the variables "leftOne" and "rightOne" represent the number of '1' characters in the substring of "s" from index "mid" to "n-1", and their values are updated accordingly based on the characters in the substring.
