Output State: **left equals 0, leftZero is less than or equal to half of mid, leftOne is less than or equal to half of mid, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the first half of s.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed until the `left` variable has reached 0, which means that all characters in the first half of the string `s` have been processed. The `leftZero` and `leftOne` variables now represent the total number of '0' and '1' characters in the first half of `s`, respectively. The `rightZero` and `rightOne` variables now represent the total number of '0' and '1' characters in the second half of `s`, respectively, plus the number of '0' and '1' characters that were moved from the first half to the second half during the loop execution.
