Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, i is 1, leftZero is 1 or 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1 or 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0. The value of `n` remains an integer, and the value of `s` remains a string. The value of `mid` is still greater than 1. The value of `i` is still 1. 

The value of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` is either 1 or 2, depending on the initial value of `leftZero` and `tleftZero`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are 2; otherwise, they are 1. The values of `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
