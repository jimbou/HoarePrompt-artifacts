Postcondition: ***`left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftOne`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `stdin`, and `i` are updated based on the conditions of `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are increased by 1, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` is printed based on the conditions of `left` and `right`, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are increased by 2. In both cases, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 2, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are 0, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `i` is 2.***
