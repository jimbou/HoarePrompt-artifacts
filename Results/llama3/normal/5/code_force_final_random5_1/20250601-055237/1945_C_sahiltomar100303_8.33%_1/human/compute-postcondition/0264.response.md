Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` (which equals `mid`) is less than `n` and increased by 1, If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `mid` plus 1, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `mid`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, and `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `mid`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `mid` plus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, and `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` (which is equal to `mid`) has been increased by 1, and its new value is still less than `n`. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain the same as before, but their relationships with `mid` and `s[right]` have been updated accordingly.
