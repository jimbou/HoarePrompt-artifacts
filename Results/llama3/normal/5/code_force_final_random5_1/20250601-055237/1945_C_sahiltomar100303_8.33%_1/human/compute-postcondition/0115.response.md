To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(mid):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `mid`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `mid` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `mid` must be greater than 2.

State: **`left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 2, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `i` is 2**
