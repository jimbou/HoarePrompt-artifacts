Output State: **left and right are printed based on the conditions of left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne, i is mid + 1, n is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no inputs, _ is 1, t is greater than 1, rightOne is increased by 1, trightOne is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are used to print `left` and `right`. The value of `i` remains `mid + 1`, and `n` is still greater than `mid + 1`. The string `s` and the value of `mid` also remain unchanged. The input stream `stdin` is still empty, and the value of `_` is still 1. The value of `t` is still greater than 1. Additionally, the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` are each increased by 1.
