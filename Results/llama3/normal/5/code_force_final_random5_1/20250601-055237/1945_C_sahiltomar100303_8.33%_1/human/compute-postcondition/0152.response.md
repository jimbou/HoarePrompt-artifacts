Output State: **`left` is greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0, `right`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. If `s[left]` is '0', either `leftZero` is less than `(left // 2) - 1` or `rightOne` is less than `(n - left) // 2`, and if `s[left + 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is two less than its original value and `rightZero` is two more than its original value. If `s[left + 1]` is not '0', `leftOne` is two less than its original value and `rightOne` is two more than its original value. If `s[left]` is not '0', either `leftZero` is less than `left // 2` or `rightOne` is less than `(n - left) // 2`, and if `s[left + 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is one less than its original value and `rightZero` is one more than its original value. If `s[left + 1]` is not '0', `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1. The conditions for `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` have been updated based on the new value of `left` and the values of `s[left]` and `s[left + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
