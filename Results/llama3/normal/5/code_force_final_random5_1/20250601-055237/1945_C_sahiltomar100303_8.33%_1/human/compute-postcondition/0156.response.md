Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` such that `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` and `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer and greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains no inputs, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, and the current value of `s[right]` is '0'.**
