Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n (the number of houses) and a string s of length n (representing the preferences of the residents). It then calculates the number of '0' and '1' characters in the first and second halves of the string and adjusts the boundaries of the halves based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the index of the boundary that is closer to or at the same distance from the middle index of the string, or the index of the boundary that meets certain conditions if one of the boundaries is at the start or end of the string.**
