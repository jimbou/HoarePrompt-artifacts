Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and must be greater than 0, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, i is 0, and the character at index i of string s is not '0'**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
