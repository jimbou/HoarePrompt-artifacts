The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `t` is not specified. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. So for the loop to execute again `_` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1**
