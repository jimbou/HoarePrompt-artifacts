Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 1 or 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1 or 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0. Otherwise, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 2, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 0.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` have been updated based on the initial conditions and the changes made by the code.
