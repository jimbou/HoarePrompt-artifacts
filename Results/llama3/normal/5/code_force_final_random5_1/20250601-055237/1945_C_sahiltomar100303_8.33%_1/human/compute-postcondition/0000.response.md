Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains multiple test cases, but with one less line, since the first line has been read and assigned to `t`.
