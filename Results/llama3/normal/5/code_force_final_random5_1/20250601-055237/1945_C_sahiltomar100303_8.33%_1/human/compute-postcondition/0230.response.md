Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, t is greater than 1, stdin contains no inputs, n is greater than mid + 1. If s[i] is '0', then i is the index of a '0' character in s, leftZero and tleftZero are the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one, rightZero and trightZero are 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne and trightOne are 1. If s[i] is not '0', then i is mid + 1, leftZero and tleftZero are the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero and trightZero are 0, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne and trightOne are 2.**

The code increments the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are now 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
