State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mid` + 1, `leftZero` is between 0 and `mid` + 1 (inclusive), `rightZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `leftOne` is between 0 and `mid` + 1 (inclusive), `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `mid` + 1 (inclusive), `trightZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `mid` + 1 (inclusive), `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.**
