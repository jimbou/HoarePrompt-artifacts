Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than 1, t is greater than 1, i equals n, left equals mid - 1, leftMove is 0. If the character at index left of s is '0', then leftZero is less than half of mid minus 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus 2, and rightOne is less than half of n - mid + 1. If the character at index left of s is not '0', then leftZero is less than half of mid, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus 1, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus 1, and rightOne is less than half of n - mid + 1 plus 1.**
