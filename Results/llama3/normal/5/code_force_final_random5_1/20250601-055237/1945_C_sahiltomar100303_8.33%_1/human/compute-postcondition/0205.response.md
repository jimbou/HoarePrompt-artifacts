The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `t` is unknown, but it must be at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.
