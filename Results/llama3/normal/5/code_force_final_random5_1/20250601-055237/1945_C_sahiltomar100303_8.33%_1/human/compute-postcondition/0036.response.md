Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and is greater than 0 and less than n-1, i is equal to n, leftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive) and is one less than its original value, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1 and is one more than its original value, leftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftZero is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is between 0 and n (inclusive), trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, left is equal to mid and is greater than 0, leftMove is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line. The character at index left - 1 in string s is '0'.**

In this output state, the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero` have been modified by the code. `leftZero` has been decremented by 1, and `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is still '0'.
