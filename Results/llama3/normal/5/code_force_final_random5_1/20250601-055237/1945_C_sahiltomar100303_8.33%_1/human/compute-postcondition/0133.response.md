Postcondition: **left and right are printed based on the conditions of left, right, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, and rightOne, i is mid + 2, n is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no inputs, _ is 1, t is greater than 1. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are increased by 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are increased by 1.**
