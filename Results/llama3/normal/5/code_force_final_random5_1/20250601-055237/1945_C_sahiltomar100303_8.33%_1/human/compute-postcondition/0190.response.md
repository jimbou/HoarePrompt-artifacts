Output: **right is equal to n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0, and left is not equal to 0. The current value of right is equal to n. Additionally, the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 (tleftZero) is greater than or equal to half of the total length of the string s (n+1)/2, and the value of right which is equal to n is being printed**
