Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`. If `left` is 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed if `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise the value of `left` is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of either `left` or `right` is printed, depending on which one has an absolute difference with `(n + 1) // 2` that is less than or equal to the other's absolute difference with `(n + 1) // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *right is either equal to n or not, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0. If left is 0, then if right is not equal to n, the value of right is printed. If right is equal to n, then if the number of '1' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of left which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is equal to n is printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right is equal to n and the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 (tleftZero) is greater than or equal to half of the total length of the string s (n+1)/2, then the value of right which is equal to n is being printed. Otherwise, if right is equal to n, the value of left is being printed. If right is not equal to n, the value of either left or right is printed, depending on which one has a smaller absolute difference with the middle index ((n + 1) // 2).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: right equals n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of mid plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is less than or equal to half of mid plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, trightZero is 0, and trightOne is 0. If left is 0, then if right is not equal to n, the value of right which is equal to the initial value of n is printed. If right equals n, then if the current value of rightOne is greater than or equal to half of n plus 1, divided by 2, then the value of left which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is n is printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right equals n, the value of either right or left is printed based on the condition tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2. If tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of n plus 1, the value of right which is n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left is printed. If right is not equal to n, the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to or at the same distance from the middle index ((n + 1) // 2).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
