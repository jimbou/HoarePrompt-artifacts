Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description states that the array can be split into two parts and the parts can be swapped, but the program does not consider this operation. The program only checks if the array is already sorted or if it can be sorted by swapping adjacent elements.

A counterexample is the array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]. The program will return 'No' because the array is not sorted and cannot be sorted by swapping adjacent elements. However, the array can be sorted by splitting it into two parts [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swapping them, resulting in the sorted array [4, 1, 5, 3, 1].

The program should be modified to consider the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. One possible solution is to check all possible splits of the array and see if any of them result in a sorted array.
