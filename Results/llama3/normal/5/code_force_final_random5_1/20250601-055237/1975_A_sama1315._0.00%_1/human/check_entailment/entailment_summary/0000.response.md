Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times. 

Function `func_1` checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted, and 'No' if it's not, specifically when there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings representing integers, where the first string is the number of test cases (t), followed by t sets of data. Each set of data starts with the number of elements (n) in the set, followed by n integers. The function applies `func_1` to each set of data and appends the result to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result in the list on a separate line, separated by newline characters.

However, the problem statement requires the program to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation any number of times. The given program only checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order, but it does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.

Therefore, the given program does not meet the problem description, and it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
