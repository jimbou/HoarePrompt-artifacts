Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 2 plus n plus 2n, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data and is at least 3, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), the result of func_1(arr), and the result of func_1(arr), arr is a list of n integers, n is the integer value of the string at index 1 in data, and _ is 2**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `index`, `arr`, and `results`. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the string at the current `index` in `data`. The `index` is incremented by 1 to point to the next string in `data`. The `arr` is created by mapping the next `n` strings in `data` to integers, and the `index` is incremented by `n` to point to the string after the `n` integers. The result of `func_1(arr)` is appended to the `results` list. The values of `data`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged.
