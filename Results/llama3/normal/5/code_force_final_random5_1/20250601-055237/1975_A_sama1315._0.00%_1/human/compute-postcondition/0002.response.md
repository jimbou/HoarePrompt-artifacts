Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 1 plus n, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data and is at least 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), arr is a list of n integers, n is the integer value of the string at index 1 in data, and _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `index` has been incremented by `n`, which is the integer value of the string at index 1 in `data`. The value of `arr` has been updated to a list of `n` integers, which are the integer values of the strings in `data` starting from index 1 plus 1. The value of `results` has been updated to a list containing the result of `func_1(arr)`, which is a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a result. The values of `data`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged.
