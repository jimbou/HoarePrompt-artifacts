Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.

Function 1, `func_1(arr)`, checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns 'Yes'. If the array is not sorted, the function checks if there are any pairs of adjacent elements that are in decreasing order. If such pairs exist, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Function 2, `func_2()`, reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls Function 1 for each test case. It then prints the results.

However, Function 1 does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any pairs of adjacent elements in decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order.

For example, the array [7, 9, 2, 2, 3] can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into [7] and [9, 2, 2, 3] and then swapping these two parts. However, Function 1 would return 'No' for this array because it does not consider this possibility.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
