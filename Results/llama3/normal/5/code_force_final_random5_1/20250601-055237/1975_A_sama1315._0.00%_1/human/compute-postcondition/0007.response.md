Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 1 plus t times n, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) for each iteration, arr is a list of n integers, n is the integer value of the string at index 1 in data, and _ is t-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the index has moved t times n positions forward in the data list, the results list contains the results of func_1(arr) for each iteration, and the loop counter _ has reached t-1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
