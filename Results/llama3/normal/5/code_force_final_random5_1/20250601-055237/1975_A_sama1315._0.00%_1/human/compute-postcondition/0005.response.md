The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 2 plus n, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data and is at least 3, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) and the result of func_1(arr), arr is a list of n integers, n is the integer value of the string at index 1 in data, and _ is 2**
