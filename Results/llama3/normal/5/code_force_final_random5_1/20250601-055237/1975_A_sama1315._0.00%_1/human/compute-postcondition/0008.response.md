Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer.
* `index` is 1 plus `t` times `n`, where `t` is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in `data`, and `n` is the integer value of the string at index 1 in `data`.
* `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, where `arr` is a list of `n` integers.
* The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the `results` list with newline characters (`\n`) in between.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The `results` list contains the results of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration. Since `arr` is a list of `n` integers, and `func_1` is not defined in the precondition, we can't determine the exact values of the results. However, we can say that each result is the output of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers.
2. The `join` method concatenates the elements of the `results` list with newline characters (`\n`) in between. This means that each result will be printed on a new line.

Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, where each line contains the result of `func_1(arr)` for a particular iteration. The exact values of the results are unknown, but we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **A series of lines, where each line contains the result of func_1(arr) for a particular iteration, separated by newline characters**
