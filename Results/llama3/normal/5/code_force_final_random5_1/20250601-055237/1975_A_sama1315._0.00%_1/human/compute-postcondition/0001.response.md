To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, `index` is 1, `t` is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in `data` and is at least 1, `results` is an empty list, `arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, and `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0**
