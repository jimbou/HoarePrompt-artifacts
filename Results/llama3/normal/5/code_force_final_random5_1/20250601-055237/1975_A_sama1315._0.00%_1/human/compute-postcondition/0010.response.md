Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings representing integers, where the first string is the number of test cases (t), followed by t sets of data. Each set of data starts with the number of elements (n) in the set, followed by n integers. The function applies another function (func_1) to each set of data and appends the result to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result in the list on a separate line, separated by newline characters.**
