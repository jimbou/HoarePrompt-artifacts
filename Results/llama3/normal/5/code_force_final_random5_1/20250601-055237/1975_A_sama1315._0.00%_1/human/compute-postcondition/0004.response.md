Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 2 plus n, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data and is at least 2, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) and the result of func_1(arr), arr is a list of n integers, n is the integer value of the string at index 1 in data, and _ is 1**

In this final state, the value of `index` has been incremented by `n + 1` due to the two increment operations. The value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the string at index 1 in `data`. The list `arr` has been populated with `n` integers from `data` starting at the updated `index`. The `results` list has been appended with the result of `func_1(arr)`, which is the result of the function call with the newly populated `arr`. The values of `data`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged.
