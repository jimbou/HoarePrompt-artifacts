Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 1, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data, results is an empty list, arr is a list of integers, n is a positive integer, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(arr)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 1 plus n, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data and is at least 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), arr is a list of n integers, n is the integer value of the string at index 1 in data, and _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 2 plus n, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data and is at least 2, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) and the result of func_1(arr), arr is a list of n integers, n is the integer value of the string at index 1 in data, and _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 2 plus n plus 2n, t is a positive integer equal to the integer value of the first string in data and is at least 3, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), the result of func_1(arr), and the result of func_1(arr), arr is a list of n integers, n is the integer value of the string at index 1 in data, and _ is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
