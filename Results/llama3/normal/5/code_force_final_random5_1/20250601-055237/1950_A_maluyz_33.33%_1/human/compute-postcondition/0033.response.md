To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how the variables in it change.

The loop head is `for i in range(t):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. Otherwise, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, then 'NONE' is printed. Otherwise, if the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
