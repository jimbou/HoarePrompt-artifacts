Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), and either `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`. Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal***
