Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a < b > c, but a is not equal to c. In this case, the program should print "PEAK", but it prints "NONE" instead.

For example, if the input is "1 5 3", the program should print "PEAK", but it prints "NONE".

The correct condition for a peak is a < b > c, not max(a, b, c) == b. The max(a, b, c) == b condition is not sufficient to determine a peak, as it does not consider the relationship between a and c.
