Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, then 'NONE' is printed. Otherwise, if the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
