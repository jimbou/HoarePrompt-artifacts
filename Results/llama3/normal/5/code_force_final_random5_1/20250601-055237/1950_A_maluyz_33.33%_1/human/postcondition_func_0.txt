The function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains three digits. It then classifies each set of three digits into one of four categories: 'STAIR' if the digits are in strictly increasing order, 'PEAK' if the middle digit is the largest, 'NONE' if all digits are equal, and 'NONE' otherwise. The classification is printed to the console for each set of three digits. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables.
