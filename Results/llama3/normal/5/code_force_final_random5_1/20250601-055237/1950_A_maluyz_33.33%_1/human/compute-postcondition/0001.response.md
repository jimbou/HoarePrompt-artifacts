The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute, so `t` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
