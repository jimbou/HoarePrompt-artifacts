Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and are the values of the first line of input from stdin, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. Otherwise, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, then 'NONE' is printed. Otherwise, if the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `i` is still 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned the values of the first line of input from stdin, which contains three digits between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines of input. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'NONE', or 'PEAK' remain the same based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
