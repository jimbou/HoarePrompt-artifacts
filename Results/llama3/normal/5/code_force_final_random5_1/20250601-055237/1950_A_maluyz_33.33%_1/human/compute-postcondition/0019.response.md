Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not in ascending order, either 'NONE' is printed if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal or if the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`, or 'PEAK' is printed if the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`***
