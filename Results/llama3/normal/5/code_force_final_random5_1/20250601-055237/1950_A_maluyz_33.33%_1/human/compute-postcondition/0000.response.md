Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**.

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), which were present in the initial state. The value of `t` is now known and is used to describe the number of lines in the stdin.
