Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and are the values of the last line of input from stdin, stdin is empty. If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. Otherwise, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, then 'NONE' is printed. Otherwise, if the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input lines from stdin, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values of the last line of input. The loop has printed a message for each line of input, either 'STAIR', 'NONE', or 'PEAK', depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
