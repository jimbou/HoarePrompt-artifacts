Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the three digits read from the first line of the input, which are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing three digits, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
