Reasoning: 
The function `func_1` is supposed to move a player or the Bludger in a certain direction. However, the function is not correctly implemented. It is trying to add an integer and a string, which will result in a TypeError. The function should be modified to add the corresponding movement to the player's or Bludger's position.

Correctness: **False**
