This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input, where 'a' contains two integers and 'b' contains two strings. It then returns two values: the concatenation of the first integer in 'a' with the first string in 'b', and the concatenation of the second integer in 'a' with the second string in 'b'. The function does not modify the input lists.
