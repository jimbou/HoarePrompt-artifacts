Output State: **a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings, x is the first integer in a, y is the second integer in a, dx is the first string in b, dy is the second string in b**

The code executes two lines, each assigning values to new variables from the existing lists `a` and `b`. The first line unpacks the list `a` into two variables `x` and `y`, assigning the first integer in `a` to `x` and the second integer to `y`. The second line similarly unpacks the list `b` into `dx` and `dy`, assigning the first string in `b` to `dx` and the second string to `dy`. The original lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as do their contents.
