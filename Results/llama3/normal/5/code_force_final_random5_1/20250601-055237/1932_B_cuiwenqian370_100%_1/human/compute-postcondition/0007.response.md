The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 4, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), i is 3**
