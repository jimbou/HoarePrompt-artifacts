The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `n + 1`, but since `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n + 1`, which is not possible. However, since `i` is in the range from 1 to `n`, `i` can be at most `n - 1` for the loop to execute again. So `i` is `n - 1 + 1` which is `n` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n`. Since `n` is at least 3, for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing one string which is the value of last_year, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, _ is 1, n must be at least 4, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is n**
