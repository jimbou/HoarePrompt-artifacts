To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 3 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing three strings which are the values of last_year, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]), i is 2**
