According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which means `n` must be at least 2 for `i` to be at least 1. So, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `index` is 2 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing one string which is the value of `last_year`, `stdin` contains `T - 2` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`**
