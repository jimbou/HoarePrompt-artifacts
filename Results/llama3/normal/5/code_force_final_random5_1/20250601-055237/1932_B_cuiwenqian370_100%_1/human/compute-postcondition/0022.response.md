Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 3 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing three strings which are the values of last_year, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is a[0], i is n**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of T remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 1000. The value of index has increased by n + 1 due to the two increments in the code. The results list still contains three strings, which are the values of last_year. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, T - 3. The value of _ is still 2. The value of n is now an integer, but its specific value is not changed by the code. The list a now contains n integers, which were read from the data at the current index. The value of last_year is now the first element of the list a, a[0]. The value of i is still n.
