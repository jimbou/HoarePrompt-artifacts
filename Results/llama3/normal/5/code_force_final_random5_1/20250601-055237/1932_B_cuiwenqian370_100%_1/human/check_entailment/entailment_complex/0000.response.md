Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The program reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the results.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. Read the number of test cases (T) and the number of signs (n) for each test case.
2. For each test case, read the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
3. Initialize the last year (last_year) to the first sign's periodicity (a_1).
4. Iterate through the remaining signs (i = 1 to n-1):
   a. Calculate the next year (next_year) by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity (a_i) that is greater than the last year (last_year).
   b. Update the last year (last_year) to the next year (next_year).
5. Append the final value of last_year as a string to the results list.
6. Write all the results to standard output, separated by newline characters.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The use of integer division and multiplication to calculate the next year ensures that the result is always a multiple of the sign's periodicity, which is a key requirement of the problem.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
