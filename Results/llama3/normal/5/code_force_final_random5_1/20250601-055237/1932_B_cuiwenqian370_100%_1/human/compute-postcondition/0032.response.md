Output State: **T is 0, index is 1, results is a list containing T strings which are the values of last_year, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is -1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1, and the output is the concatenation of all strings in results followed by a newline character.**

The code writes the concatenation of all strings in the results list followed by a newline character to the standard output. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output is the concatenation of all strings in results followed by a newline character.
