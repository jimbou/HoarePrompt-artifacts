Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is an integer**

The code block executes as follows:

1. `n = int(data[index])`: This line assigns the value of the integer at index `index` in the `data` list to `n`. Since `index` is 1, this line reads the first test case from `stdin` and assigns its value to `n`. `stdin` now contains `T - 1` test cases.

2. `index += 1`: This line increments `index` by 1, so `index` becomes 2.

3. `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`: This line reads `n` integers from `stdin` starting from the current `index` (2) and assigns them to the list `a`. Since `index` is 2, this line reads the next `n` integers from `stdin` and assigns them to `a`. `stdin` now contains `T - 1 - n` test cases.

4. `index += n`: This line increments `index` by `n`, so `index` becomes `1 + n + 1`.

5. `last_year = a[0]`: This line assigns the first element of the list `a` to `last_year`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` becomes an integer.

The final state is:

* `T` is still an integer between 1 and 1000.
* `index` is now `1 + n + 1`.
* `results` is still an empty list.
* `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.
* `_` is still 0.
* `n` is an integer (the value read from `stdin`).
* `a` is a list of `n` integers (read from `stdin`).
* `last_year` is an integer (the first element of the list `a`).
