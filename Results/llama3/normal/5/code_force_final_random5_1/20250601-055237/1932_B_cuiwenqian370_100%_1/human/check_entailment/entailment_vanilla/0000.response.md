Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases, the number of signs, and the periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the input data and stores it in the `data` list.
2. It then iterates over the number of test cases (`T`).
3. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`a`).
4. It initializes the `last_year` variable to the periodicity of the first sign (`a[0]`).
5. It then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second sign to the n-th sign).
6. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the previous year.
7. It updates the `last_year` variable to the calculated next year.
8. After iterating over all signs, it appends the final `last_year` value to the `results` list.
9. Finally, it writes the `results` list to the standard output, with each result on a new line.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
