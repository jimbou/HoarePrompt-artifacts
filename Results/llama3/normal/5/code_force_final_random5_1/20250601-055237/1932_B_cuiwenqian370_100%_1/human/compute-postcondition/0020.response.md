Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing two strings which are the values of last_year, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is a[n-1], i is n**

The code appends the string value of `last_year` to the `results` list. The `results` list initially contains one string, which is the value of `last_year`. After the code is executed, the `results` list now contains two strings, both of which are the values of `last_year`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
