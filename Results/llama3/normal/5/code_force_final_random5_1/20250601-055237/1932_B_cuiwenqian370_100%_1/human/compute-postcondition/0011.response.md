The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and for the loop to execute again T must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing one string which is the value of `last_year`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), `i` is `n-1`**
