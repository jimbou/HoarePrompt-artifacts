The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 3 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing three strings which are the values of last_year, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), i is 3**
