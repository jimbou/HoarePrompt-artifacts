Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program reads the input data, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to calculate the year of the n-th sign. It iterates through the list of periodicities, starting from the second sign, and calculates the next year in which the current sign will occur. This is done by adding 1 to the last year, dividing the result by the periodicity of the current sign, rounding up to the nearest integer, and multiplying by the periodicity.

The program correctly handles the case where the periodicity of a sign is 1, as it simply adds 1 to the last year in this case.

The program also correctly handles the case where the periodicity of a sign is greater than 1, as it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur by rounding up to the nearest multiple of the periodicity.

The program does not contain any syntax errors, and it correctly uses the input data and the calculated results to produce the output.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
