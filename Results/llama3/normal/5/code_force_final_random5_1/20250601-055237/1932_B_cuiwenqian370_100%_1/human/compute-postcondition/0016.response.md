Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing one string which is the value of last_year, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, _ is 1, n must be at least 3, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is n**

In this output state, the value of `last_year` has been updated to the new value calculated by the expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
