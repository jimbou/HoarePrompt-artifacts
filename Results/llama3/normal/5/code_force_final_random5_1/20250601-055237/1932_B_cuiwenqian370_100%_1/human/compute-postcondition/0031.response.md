Output State: **T is 0, index is T + n + 1, results is a list containing T strings which are the values of last_year, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is T-1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1**

The loop has executed all its iterations when T becomes 0. The index has moved T + n + 1 positions forward, where n is the number of integers in the last test case. The results list contains T strings, each representing the value of last_year for each test case. The stdin contains 0 test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The loop variable _ has reached T-1, and the variables n, a, last_year, and i retain their values from the last iteration.
