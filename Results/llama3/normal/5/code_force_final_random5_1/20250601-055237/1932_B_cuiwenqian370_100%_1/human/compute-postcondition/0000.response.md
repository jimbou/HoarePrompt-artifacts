Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains T test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. The first element of this list is converted to an integer and assigned to T, which represents the number of test cases. The index variable is incremented to 1 to keep track of the current position in the data list. An empty list called results is initialized to store the results of the test cases. The remaining input in stdin consists of T test cases, each containing an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
