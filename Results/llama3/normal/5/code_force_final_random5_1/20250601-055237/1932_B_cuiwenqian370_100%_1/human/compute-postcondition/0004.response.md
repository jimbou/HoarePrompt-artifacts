Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]), i is 1**

The code snippet modifies the value of `last_year` by calculating a new value based on the previous value of `last_year`, the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 1), and then assigns this new value back to `last_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
