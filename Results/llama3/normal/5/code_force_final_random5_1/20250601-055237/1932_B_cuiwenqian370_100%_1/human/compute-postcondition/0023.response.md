To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `index` is 3 + n + 1 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing three strings which are the values of `last_year`, `stdin` contains `T - 3` test cases, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is `a[0]`, `i` is 1**
