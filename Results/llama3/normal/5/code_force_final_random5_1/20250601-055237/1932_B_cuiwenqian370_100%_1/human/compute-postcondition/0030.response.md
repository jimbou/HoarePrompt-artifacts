Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 3 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing four strings which are the values of last_year, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T remains the same, which is an integer between 2 and 1000. The index is still 3 + n + 1 + n + 1. The results list now contains four strings, which are the values of last_year. The stdin contains T - 4 test cases. The value of _ is still 2. The value of n is still an integer. The list a still contains n integers. The value of last_year is still ((a[0] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]). The value of i is still n.
