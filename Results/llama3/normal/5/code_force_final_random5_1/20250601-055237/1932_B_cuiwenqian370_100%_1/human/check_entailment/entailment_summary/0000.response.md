Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the results.

The program's logic is as follows:

1.  It reads the number of test cases (T) and the number of signs (n) for each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
3.  It initializes the variable `last_year` to the periodicity of the first sign (a_1).
4.  It then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second sign to the n-th sign). For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur by using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a_i - 1) // a_i * a_i`. This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign.
5.  It updates the `last_year` variable with the calculated next year.
6.  After processing all signs, it appends the final value of `last_year` as a string to the `results` list.
7.  Finally, it writes all the results to standard output, separated by newline characters.

The program's logic correctly implements the problem's requirements. It iteratively updates the `last_year` variable based on the given integers, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous sign. The program also handles multiple test cases and outputs the results correctly.

Correctness: **True**
