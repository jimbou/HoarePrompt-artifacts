To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, n):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1` and `n` is at least 2.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n`. However, since `i` cannot be equal to `n` for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n`. This means `n` must be at least 3.

The other variables in the state, such as `T`, `index`, `results`, `stdin`, `_`, `a`, and `last_year`, are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `index` is 2 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing one string which is the value of `last_year`, `stdin` contains `T - 2` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, `i` is `n`**
