According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `index` is 1 + n + 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains T - 1 test cases, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `last_year` is an integer. However, only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, which are `i` and `n`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is now 1. The other variables are not relevant to the loop head.

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains T - 1 test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is an integer, `i` is 1**
