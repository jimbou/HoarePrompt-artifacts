Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing one string which is the value of last_year, stdin contains T - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1**

In this output state, the value of last_year has been appended to the results list as a string. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains T - 1 test cases, and the values of T, index, _, n, a, and i are the same as in the initial state.
