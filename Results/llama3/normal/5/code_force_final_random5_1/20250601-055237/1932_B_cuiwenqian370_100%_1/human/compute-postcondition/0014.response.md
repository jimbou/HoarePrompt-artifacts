Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing one string which is the value of last_year, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, _ is 1, n must be at least 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i], i is n-1**

In this output state, the value of `last_year` has been updated to `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which is the result of the calculation performed in the code. The value of `next_year` is not included in the output state as it is only used as a temporary variable to hold the result of the calculation before it is assigned to `last_year`. All other variables remain unchanged.
