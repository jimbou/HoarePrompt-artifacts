Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing one string which is the value of last_year, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is a[n-1], i is n**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `last_year` has been updated to be the last element of the list `a`, and the value of `i` has been updated to be equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
