Output State: **The loop terminates after 3 iterations, and the final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the loop executes three times, modifying the list elements at indices i, i-1, and i+1 according to the specified rules. After the third iteration, the loop condition is no longer satisfied because the element at index i-1 becomes 0, causing the loop to terminate. The values of n and i remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
