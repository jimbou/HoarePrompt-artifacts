Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop terminates after 4 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0, i is 4, n is greater than 5
Code of the loop:
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
    list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
    list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, list[4] must be greater than 1, list[3] must be greater than 0, and list[5] must be greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by five times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, list[4] must be greater than 1, list[3] must be greater than 0, and list[5] must be greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by seven times the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i-1 is 0, and the value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, list[4] must be greater than 1, list[3] must be greater than 0, and list[5] must be greater than 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
