Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 checks if all elements of the list up to index n-1 are 0. If any element is not 0, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

func_2 is the main function that attempts to make all elements of the list equal to zero. It iterates over the list from index 1 to n-2. For each index i, it checks if the element at index i is greater than 1 and the elements at indices i-1 and i+1 are greater than 0. If these conditions are met, it subtracts the value of the element at index i-1 from the elements at indices i+1 and i, and subtracts 1 from the element at index i-1. This process is repeated until the element at index i-1 becomes 0.

After the loop terminates, func_2 calls func_1 to check if all elements of the list are 0. If func_1 returns True, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the operation described in the problem statement. The loop in func_2 correctly applies the operation to each element in the list, and the call to func_1 ensures that the program checks if all elements are 0 after the operation is applied.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the while loop of func_2, the program subtracts the value of the element at index i-1 from the elements at indices i+1 and i, and subtracts 1 from the element at index i-1. This is not the correct implementation of the operation described in the problem statement. The correct implementation should subtract 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtract 2 from the element at index i.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
