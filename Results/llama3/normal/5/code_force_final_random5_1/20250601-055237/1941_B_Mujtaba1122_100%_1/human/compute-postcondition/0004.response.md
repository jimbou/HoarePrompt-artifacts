Output State: **The list is modified such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
The first line reduces the element at index i+1 by the value of the element at index i-1. The second line reduces the element at index i by twice the value of the element at index i-1. The third line reduces the element at index i-1 by its own value, effectively setting it to 0. Since the element at index i-1 is greater than 0 initially, it will be reduced to 0 after the third line executes. The element at index i is reduced by twice the value of the element at index i-1 in the second line, and then the element at index i-1 is set to 0 in the third line, so the net effect on the element at index i is a reduction by three times the original value of the element at index i-1. The value of n and i remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
