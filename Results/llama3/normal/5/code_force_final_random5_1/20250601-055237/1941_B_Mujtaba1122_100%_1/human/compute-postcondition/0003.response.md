To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the while loop statement and adjust the states accordingly.

The while loop statement is:
```
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
```
The conditions are:

1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

At the end of the previous iteration, the list is modified such that:

* The element at index `i+1` is reduced by the value of the element at index `i-1`.
* The element at index `i` is reduced by twice the value of the element at index `i-1`.
* The element at index `i-1` is reduced to 0.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the elements in the list.

Since `list[i-1]` is reduced to 0, condition 2 (`list[i - 1] > 0`) will not be true. To make it true, we need to adjust the state of `list[i-1]` to be greater than 0.

The other conditions, `list[i] > 1` and `list[i + 1] > 0`, may or may not be true depending on the values of the elements. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to assume that these conditions are true.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **The list is modified such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by twice the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is greater than 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged.**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `list[i-1]` to be greater than 0, as it is the only condition that is guaranteed to be false after the previous iteration. The other conditions are assumed to be true, but their actual values are not changed.
