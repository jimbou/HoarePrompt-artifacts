Output State: **The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, list[4] must be greater than 1, list[3] must be greater than 0, and list[5] must be greater than 0.**

In this final state, the element at index i+1 has been reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i has been reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is now 0. The values of n and i remain unchanged. Also, list[4] is greater than 1, list[3] is greater than 0, and list[5] is greater than 0.
