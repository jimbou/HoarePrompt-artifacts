According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, list is a list of non-negative integers and n is a positive integer such that n >= 3 and n is equal to the length of the list, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and i is now 1. 
State: **list is a list of non-negative integers, n is a positive integer such that n >= 3 and n is equal to the length of the list, i is 1**
