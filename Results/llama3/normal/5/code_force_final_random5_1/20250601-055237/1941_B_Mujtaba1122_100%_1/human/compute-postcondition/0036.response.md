Postcondition: **The loop terminates after n-2 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0. If the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
