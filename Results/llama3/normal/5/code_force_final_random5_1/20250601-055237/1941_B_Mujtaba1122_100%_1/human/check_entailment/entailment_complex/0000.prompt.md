Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

# Annotated Functions:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: list is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list), `i` is n, and all elements of list up to index n-1 are 0. If any element of list up to index n-1 is not 0, the function returns False. Otherwise, no change is made.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements of the list up to index n-1 are 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if all elements in a list up to a given index (n-1) are zero. It accepts a list of integers and a non-negative integer n as parameters, where n is within the bounds of the list. The function returns True if all elements up to index n-1 are zero, and False otherwise. The function does not modify the input list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, n is a positive integer such that n >= 3 and n is equal to the length of the list.
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: The loop terminates after n-2 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The loop terminates after n-2 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0. If the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer n as input, where n is equal to the length of the list and is greater than or equal to 3. It modifies the list by iterating through it and reducing the value of each element at index i+1 by the value of the element at index i-1, reducing the value of each element at index i by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and setting the element at index i-1 to 0. After modifying the list, it calls another function func_1 with the modified list and n as arguments. If func_1 returns True, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
