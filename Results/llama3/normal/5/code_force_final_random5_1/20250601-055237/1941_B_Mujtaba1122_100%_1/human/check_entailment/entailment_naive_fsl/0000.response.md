Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One example where the program fails is when the input list is [1, 2, 7, 2]. The program will print 'NO' but it should print 'NO' because it is not possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation allows Rudolf to choose an index i and assign a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1, a_i = a_i - 2, and a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1. However, the program does not correctly implement this operation. 

In the function func_2, the while loop condition is incorrect. It should be while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0 instead of while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0). 

Also, the operation is not correctly implemented inside the while loop. It should be list[i - 1] -= 1, list[i] -= 2, and list[i + 1] -= 1 instead of list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1], list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1], and list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1].

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and the correctness is False.
