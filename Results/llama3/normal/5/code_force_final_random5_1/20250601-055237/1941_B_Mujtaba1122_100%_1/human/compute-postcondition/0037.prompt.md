You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, n is a positive integer such that n >= 3 and n is equal to the length of the list.
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: The loop terminates after n-2 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The loop terminates after n-2 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0. If the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The loop terminates after n-2 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0.

Case_2: The loop terminates after n-2 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0. The current state of the program is such that the function func_1(list, n) returns True, and 'YES' is printed

Case_3: The loop terminates after n-2 iterations. The final state of the list is such that the element at index i+1 is reduced by the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is reduced by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and the element at index i-1 is 0. The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0. The function func_1(list, n) returns False. 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
