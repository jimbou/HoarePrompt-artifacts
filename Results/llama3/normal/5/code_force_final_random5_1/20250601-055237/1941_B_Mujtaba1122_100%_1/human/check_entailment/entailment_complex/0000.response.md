Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves reducing the values of three consecutive elements in the array by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

Function 1 checks if all elements in a list up to a given index (n-1) are zero. It returns True if all elements up to index n-1 are zero, and False otherwise.

Function 2 modifies the input list by iterating through it and applying the operation to each element. It then calls Function 1 to check if all elements in the modified list are zero. If Function 1 returns True, it prints 'YES', indicating that Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero using the operation. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
