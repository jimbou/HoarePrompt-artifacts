#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if all elements in a list up to a given index (n-1) are zero. It accepts a list of integers and a non-negative integer n as parameters, where n is within the bounds of the list. The function returns True if all elements up to index n-1 are zero, and False otherwise. The function does not modify the input list.

The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0.

The value of n and i remains unchanged. Additionally, the element at index i-1 is not equal to 0. If the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer n as input, where n is equal to the length of the list and is greater than or equal to 3. It modifies the list by iterating through it and reducing the value of each element at index i+1 by the value of the element at index i-1, reducing the value of each element at index i by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and setting the element at index i-1 to 0. After modifying the list, it calls another function func_1 with the modified list and n as arguments. If func_1 returns True, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
