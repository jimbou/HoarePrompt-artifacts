This function takes a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer n as input, where n is equal to the length of the list and is greater than or equal to 3. It modifies the list by iterating through it and reducing the value of each element at index i+1 by the value of the element at index i-1, reducing the value of each element at index i by three times the value of the element at index i-1, and setting the element at index i-1 to 0. After modifying the list, it calls another function func_1 with the modified list and n as arguments. If func_1 returns True, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
