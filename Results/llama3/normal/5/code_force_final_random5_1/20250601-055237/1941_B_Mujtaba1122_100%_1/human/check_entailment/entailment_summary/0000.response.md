Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves reducing the values of three consecutive elements in the array by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

Function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list up to a given index (n-1) are zero. This function is used by `func_2` to determine the final result.

Function `func_2` is the main function that attempts to make all elements of the array equal to zero. It iterates through the array, applying the operation to each element and its neighbors. If it encounters an element that cannot be reduced to zero, it prints "NO" and returns. If it successfully reduces all elements to zero, it prints "YES".

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of `func_2`. The while loop condition is incorrect, and the operation is not applied correctly. The correct implementation should involve reducing the values of the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 by 1, 2, and 1, respectively, until the element at index i is reduced to 0 or 1.

Despite this error, the program produces the correct output for the given test cases. This is because the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2` happens to produce the correct result for these specific test cases.

Therefore, based on the provided execution summaries, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

Note: The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the implementation of `func_2`, but it happens to produce the correct output for the given test cases.
