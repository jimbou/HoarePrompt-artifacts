Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem states that Nikita can either put exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move. Therefore, after n moves, the resulting tower can have exactly m cubes if and only if n is greater than or equal to m and the difference between n and m is even.

The program checks these two conditions correctly:

1.  `n >= m`: This ensures that Nikita has enough moves to put at least m cubes on the tower.
2.  `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the remaining moves after putting m cubes on the tower are even, which means Nikita can remove the same number of cubes he added, resulting in a tower with exactly m cubes.

The program prints "YES" if both conditions are met and "NO" otherwise, which is consistent with the problem description.
