Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, stdin contains at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be integers greater than 0, which are obtained from the input. The stdin still contains at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0, but the first two integers have been consumed by the input operation.
