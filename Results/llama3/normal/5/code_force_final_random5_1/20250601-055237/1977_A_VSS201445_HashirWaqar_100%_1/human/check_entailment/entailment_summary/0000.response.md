Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The given program checks two conditions:

1.  `n >= m`: This ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to build a tower of at least m cubes.
2.  `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This checks if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the difference must be even to achieve the desired number of cubes.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
