Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `_` is `t`, stdin contains at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n` and `m` will still be integers greater than 0, and the variable `_` will have taken on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations specified in the input. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remains the same as before, depending on whether `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
