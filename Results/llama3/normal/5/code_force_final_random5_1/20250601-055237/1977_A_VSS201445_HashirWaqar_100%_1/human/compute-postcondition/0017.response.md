Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the two integers greater than 0 that were input from stdin. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0, since two integers have been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
