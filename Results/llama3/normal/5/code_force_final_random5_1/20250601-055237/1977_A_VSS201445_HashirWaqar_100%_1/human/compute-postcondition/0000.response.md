To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `_` (a throwaway variable, but we'll focus on the condition that allows the loop to execute) and the `input()` function, which reads from `stdin`.

Given that `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), for the loop to execute, `stdin` must contain at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0. This is because the loop iterates `t` times, and `t` is read from `stdin` as an integer.

Thus, the state adjustments focus on ensuring that `stdin` is in a condition to provide a positive integer value for `t`, which will then determine the number of iterations. The state of `_` is not relevant as it's a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0**
