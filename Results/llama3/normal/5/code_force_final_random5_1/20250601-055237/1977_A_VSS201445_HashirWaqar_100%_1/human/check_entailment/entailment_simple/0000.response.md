Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program iterates over each test case, reads the values of n and m, and checks two conditions:

1.  If n is greater than or equal to m, it means that Nikita has enough moves to build a tower of m cubes.
2.  If the difference between n and m is even, it means that Nikita can perform an equal number of "put" and "remove" operations, resulting in a tower with m cubes.

If both conditions are met, the program prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where n is less than m. In this case, it is impossible to build a tower with m cubes, regardless of the parity of the difference between n and m. The program should print "NO" in this case.

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
