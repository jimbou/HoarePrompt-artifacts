Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program uses a simple and correct approach to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. The program then checks two conditions:
   - If n is greater than or equal to m (n >= m), it means that Nikita has enough moves to add at least m cubes to the tower.
   - If the difference between n and m (n - m) is even ((n - m) % 2 == 0), it means that Nikita can remove the excess cubes in pairs, ending up with exactly m cubes in the tower.

4. If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly addresses the problem's requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
