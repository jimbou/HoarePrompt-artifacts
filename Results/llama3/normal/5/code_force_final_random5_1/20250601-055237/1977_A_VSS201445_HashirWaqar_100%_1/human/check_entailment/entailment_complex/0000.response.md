Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the number of moves (n) must be greater than or equal to the number of cubes (m) in the final tower, and the difference between n and m must be even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, so the net change in the number of cubes must be even.

The program correctly implements this logic using the condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of n and m, and printing the corresponding output.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
