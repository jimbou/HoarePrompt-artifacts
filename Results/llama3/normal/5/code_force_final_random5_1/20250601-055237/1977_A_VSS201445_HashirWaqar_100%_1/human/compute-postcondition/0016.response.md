The only objects in the loop head are variables  `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`.  If the `int(input())` has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` has at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `int(input())` must have at least 2 integers and the `_` is 1.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, stdin contains at least two integers `t` that is greater than 0, `_` is 1**
