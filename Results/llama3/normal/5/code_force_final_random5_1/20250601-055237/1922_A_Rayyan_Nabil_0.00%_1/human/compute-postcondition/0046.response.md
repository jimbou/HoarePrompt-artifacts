Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equal to 0, `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO', `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `l` is being printed, where `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `t` has been decremented to 0. The value of `l` is determined by the existence of at least one pair of characters in `a` and `b` that are different from the corresponding character in `c`. If such a pair exists, `l` is 'YES', otherwise it is 'NO'. The loop has finished executing, and the final value of `l` is being printed.
