The code reads four lines of input from stdin: an integer `n`, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `l` is 'YES', and `i` is 0.

After executing the code, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the first line of stdin. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the string values from the next three lines of stdin, respectively.

The values of `t`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, l is 'YES', i is 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin is empty**
