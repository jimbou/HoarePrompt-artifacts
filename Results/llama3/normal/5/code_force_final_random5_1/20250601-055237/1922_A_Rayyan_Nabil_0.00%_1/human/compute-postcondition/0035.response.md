Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+n`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` has been updated to 'YES', while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+n`, `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are still strings, and `i` is still 0. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is still not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is still not equal to `c[i]`.
