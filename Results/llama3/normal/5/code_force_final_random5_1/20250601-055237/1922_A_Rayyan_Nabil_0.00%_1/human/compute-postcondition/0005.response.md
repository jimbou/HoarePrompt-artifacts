Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code `l = 'YES'` does not change any of the variables except `l`, but `l` was already 'YES' in the initial state, so there is no change in the output state.
