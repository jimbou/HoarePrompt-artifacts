This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result of each test case. It checks if there exists at least one position where the characters in strings 'a' and 'b' are different from the character in string 'c'. If such a position is found, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving stdin empty.
