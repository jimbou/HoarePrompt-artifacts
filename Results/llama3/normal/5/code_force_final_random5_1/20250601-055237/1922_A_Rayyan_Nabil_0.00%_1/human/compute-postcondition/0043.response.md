Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+n`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise `l` is 'NO'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the variable `l` will be 'YES' if there exists at least one iteration where the characters at the current index `i` in strings `a` and `b` are both different from the character at the same index in string `c`. If no such iteration exists, `l` will be 'NO'. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
