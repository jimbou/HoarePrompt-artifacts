Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `l` is 'YES' if for all `i` in range `n`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO', `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `l` will be 'YES' only if for all iterations, the condition `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` was true. If this condition was not met for any iteration, `l` will be 'NO'. The value of `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
