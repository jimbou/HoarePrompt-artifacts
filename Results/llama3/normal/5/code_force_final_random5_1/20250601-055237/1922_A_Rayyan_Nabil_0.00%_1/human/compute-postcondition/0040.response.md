The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+n+1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**
