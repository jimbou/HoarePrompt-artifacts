The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Since `t` is greater than `n+1`, it remains unchanged.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+2`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `l` is being printed, where `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether all elements in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding elements in `c`. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'.**
