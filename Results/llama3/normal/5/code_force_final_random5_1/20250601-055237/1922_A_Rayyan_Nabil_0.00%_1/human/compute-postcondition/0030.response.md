Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+n`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `l` is being printed, where `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether all elements in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding elements in `c`. If for all `i` in range `n`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'. The value of `l` is being printed.**
