Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+n+1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `l` is 'YES'.**

The value of `l` is directly assigned to 'YES', regardless of the previous conditions. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that were previously used to determine the value of `l` are no longer relevant, and `l` is now simply 'YES'.
