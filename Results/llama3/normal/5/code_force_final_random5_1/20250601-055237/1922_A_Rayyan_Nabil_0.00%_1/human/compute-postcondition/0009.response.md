Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
