Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty.**

The value of `l` is reassigned to 'YES', but it was already 'YES' in the initial state, so there is no change in the value of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
