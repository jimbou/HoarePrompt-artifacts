Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the strings a and b have the same character at a position, but the string c has a different character at the same position. In this case, the program should print "YES" because a template can be created where the character at that position is uppercase, and both a and b will match the template, but c will not. However, the program will print "NO" because it only checks if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], but it does not consider the case where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].

For example, if the input is:

3
a
a
b

The program will print "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because a template "A" can be created where both a and b match the template, but c does not.
