To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 1000, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `i` will start from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 0, stdin contains t test cases**
