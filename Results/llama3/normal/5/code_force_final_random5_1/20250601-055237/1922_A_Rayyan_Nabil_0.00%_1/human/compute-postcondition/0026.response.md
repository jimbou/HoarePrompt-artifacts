Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+3`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `l` is 'YES'**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to 'YES', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `l` now holds the string value 'YES', and all other variables retain their original values and constraints.
