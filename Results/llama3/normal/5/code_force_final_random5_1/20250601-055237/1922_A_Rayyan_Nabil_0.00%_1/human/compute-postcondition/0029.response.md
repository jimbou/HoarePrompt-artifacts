The code prints the value of `l`, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether all elements in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding elements in `c`. If for all `i` in range `n`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.

Output: **YES if all elements in a and b are different from the corresponding elements in c, NO otherwise**
