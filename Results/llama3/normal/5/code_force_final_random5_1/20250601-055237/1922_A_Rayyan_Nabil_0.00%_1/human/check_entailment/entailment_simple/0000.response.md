Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c. If it finds a character where a and b are different from c, it sets the variable l to 'YES'. If it doesn't find such a character after checking all characters, it sets l to 'NO'. This is a correct implementation of the problem description, which asks to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Correctness: **True**
