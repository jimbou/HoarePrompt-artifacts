Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result of each test case. It checks if there exists at least one position where the characters in strings 'a' and 'b' are different from the character in string 'c'. If such a position is found, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the strings 'a' and 'b' are identical, or when the string 'c' is identical to either 'a' or 'b'. It also correctly handles the case when the strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' are all different.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
