The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, it becomes the number of test cases. Stdin now contains `t` test cases. The second line assigns the string 'YES' to `l`. This does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES', stdin contains t test cases.**
