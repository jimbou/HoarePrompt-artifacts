The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than `i`. Therefore, `i` is `n+1` and `t` is greater than `n+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+1`, `l` is 'YES' if for all `i` in range `n`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO', `i` is `n+1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `l` is being printed, where `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether all elements in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding elements in `c`**
