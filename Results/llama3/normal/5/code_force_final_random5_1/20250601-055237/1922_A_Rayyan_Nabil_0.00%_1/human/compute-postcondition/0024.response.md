Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than `n+2`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES' and its value is being printed. Otherwise, no change is made to `l`***
