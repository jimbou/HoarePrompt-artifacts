According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer, but it's not guaranteed that `n` is greater than 0. So, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty**
