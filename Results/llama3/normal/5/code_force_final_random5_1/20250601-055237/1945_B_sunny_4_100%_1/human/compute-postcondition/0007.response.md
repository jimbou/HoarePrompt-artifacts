The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of the variable `ans`, which is an integer equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Since `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, the value of `ans` will be an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^18.

However, without knowing the exact values of `m`, `a`, and `b`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.

Output: **an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^18 (where the exact value depends on the values of m, a, and b)**
