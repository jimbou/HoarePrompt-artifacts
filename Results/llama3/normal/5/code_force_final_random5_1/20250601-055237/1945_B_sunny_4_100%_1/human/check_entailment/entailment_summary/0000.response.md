Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the calculation of the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The program adds 2 to the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and m by b, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should only be the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and m by b, without adding 2.

The integer division m // a calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation, and m // b calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the second installation. The sum of these two values gives the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Therefore, the correct program should be:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = m // a + m // b
        print(ans)

Correctness: **False**
