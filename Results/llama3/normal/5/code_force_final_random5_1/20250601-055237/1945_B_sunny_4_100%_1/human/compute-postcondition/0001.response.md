The only variable in the loop head is `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `qi` to be 0, since it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `qi` is 0, stdin contains t sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
