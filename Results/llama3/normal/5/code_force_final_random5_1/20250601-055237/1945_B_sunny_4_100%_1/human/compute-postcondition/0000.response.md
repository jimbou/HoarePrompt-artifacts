Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

The code first reads an integer t from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4. Then, it enters a loop that runs t times. In each iteration, it reads three space-separated integers a, b, and m from stdin. The values of a, b, and m are between 1 and 10^18. The code then calculates A and B as the integer division of m by a and b, respectively, plus 1. Finally, it prints the sum of A and B. After the loop finishes, stdin is empty.
