Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The issue lies in the line where the answer is calculated: `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. The addition of 2 is incorrect and does not follow the problem description.

A correct calculation would be `ans = m // a + m // b + 1` or simply `ans = m // a + m // b`, depending on how the problem is interpreted. The addition of 1 or not adding anything at all would account for the fact that the fireworks are visible for `m + 1` minutes, but this is already considered in the division operation.

For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `m = 1`, the program would output `4`, but the correct answer is `3` because only three fireworks can be seen simultaneously: one launched at time `0`, one launched at time `1`, and one launched at time `2`.
