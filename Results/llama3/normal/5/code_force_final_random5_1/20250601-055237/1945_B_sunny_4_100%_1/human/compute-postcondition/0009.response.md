To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `qi` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `qi` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `qi` is 1 and `t` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `qi` must be incremented by 1, so `qi` becomes 2. Since `t` is an integer greater than 1, it remains the same.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `m`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`qi` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `ans` is an integer equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`, stdin contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers**
