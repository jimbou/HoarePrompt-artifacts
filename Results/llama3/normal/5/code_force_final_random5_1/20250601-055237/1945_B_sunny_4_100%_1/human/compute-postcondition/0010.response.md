Output State: **qi is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, ans is an integer equal to m // a + m // b + 2, stdin contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three space-separated integers, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m`, respectively. This reduces the number of sets of three space-separated integers in stdin by 1. Then, it calculates the value of `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2`, which is an integer. The values of `qi` and `t` remain unchanged.
