Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and m by b, adds 2 to the result, and prints the final value. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
