The only variable in the loop head is `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `qi` and `t`. If `qi` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `qi` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `qi` must be increased by 1, so `qi` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`qi` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1, stdin contains t-2 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, ans is an integer equal to m // a + m // b + 2**
