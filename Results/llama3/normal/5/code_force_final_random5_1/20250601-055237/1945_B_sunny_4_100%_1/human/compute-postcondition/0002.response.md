Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, qi is 0, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, ans is an integer equal to m // a + m // b + 2.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three space-separated integers a, b, and m. It then assigns these values to the variables a, b, and m, respectively. The value of ans is calculated as m // a + m // b + 2, where // denotes integer division. The value of t and qi remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers.
