Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is supposed to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints, but it only finds the first integer in the range from the maximum of the first list to the minimum of the second list that is not present in the third list.

The program should count the number of integers in the range from the maximum of the first list to the minimum of the second list that are not present in the third list, not just find the first one.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        for i in range(max(big), min(less) + 1):
            if i not in no:
                num += 1
        print(num)
```

Correctness: **False**
