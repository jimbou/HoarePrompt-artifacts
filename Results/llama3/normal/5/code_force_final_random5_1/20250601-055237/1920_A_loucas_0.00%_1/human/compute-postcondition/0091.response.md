Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing one integer from the input, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read)**

In this output state, the value of `a` is still an integer from the input, but now it is also appended to the `less` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case is partially read.
