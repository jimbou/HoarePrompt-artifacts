Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing either one, two or `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, either `less` is a list containing one or two integers `a` and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or lists containing the integer `a` or `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing either one, two or `innerLoop` integers `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *loop is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), iterable is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in less, less is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in big, no is either an empty list or a list containing the integer a. If i is not in no, then num is set to i. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in less, less is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in big, no is either an empty list or a list containing the integer a. If i is not in no, then i is increased by 1 and num is equal to i. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in less, less is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in big, no is either an empty list or a list containing the integer a, if i is not in no, then i is i + 1, and num is equal to i. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
