Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three integers `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing either one, two or three integers `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, either `less` is a list containing one or two integers `a` and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or lists containing the integer `a` or `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing either one, two or three integers `a`.***
