Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
        if i not in no:
            num = i
            break
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: loop is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), iterable is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in less, less is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in big, no is either an empty list or a list containing the integer a, if i is not in no, then i is equal to min(less) - 1, and num is equal to i. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and num is printed, where num is either equal to min(less) - 1 or remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 1 and a, less is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 2 and a, no is a list containing integers from the input if x is not 1 or 2 and a, num is equal to the first integer in the range from max(big) to min(less) that is not in the list no, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), and the first integer in the range from max(big) to min(less) that is not in the list no is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than or equal to min(less), innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case, and num is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to max(big) that is not in the set no, and the value of num which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to max(big) that is not in the set no is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
