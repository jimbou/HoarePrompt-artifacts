Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing either one or two integers from the input, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer from the input. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing either one or two integers from the input.***
