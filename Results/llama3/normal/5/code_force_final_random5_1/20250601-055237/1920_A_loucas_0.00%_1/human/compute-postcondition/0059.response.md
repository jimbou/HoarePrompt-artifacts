Output State: **loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is 1, innerLoop is at least 2, num is 0, x is an integer, a is an integer, big is a list containing one integer from the input if x is 1, less contains one integer from the input if x is 2, no contains one integer from the input if x is not 1 or 2 and a, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read).**

In natural language, the output state is: The loop, iterable, iterable2, and innerLoop variables remain unchanged. The num variable is still 0. The x and a variables are still integers. The big list still contains one integer from the input if x is 1, the less list still contains one integer from the input if x is 2, and the no list now contains one integer from the input if x is not 1 or 2 and the value of a. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, with the first test case partially read.
