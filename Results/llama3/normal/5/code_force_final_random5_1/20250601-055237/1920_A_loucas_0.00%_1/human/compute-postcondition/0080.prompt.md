Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, less is a list containing integers from the input if x is 2 and a, big is a list containing integers from the input if x is 1 and a, no is a list containing integers from the input if x is not 1 or 2 and a, num is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 1, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if `x` is 1 and `a`, `less` is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if `x` is 2 and `a`, `no` is a list containing integers from the input if `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a`, `num` is equal to max(big) if `i` is not in the list `no`, `innerLoop` is the first integer `n` from the first test case, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, and `i` is equal to `max(big)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 1 and a, less is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 2 and a, no is a list containing integers from the input if x is not 1 or 2 and a, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less). If i is not in the list no, then num is equal to i. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *loop is at least 3, iterable is 1, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 1 and a, with at least one more element, less is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 2 and a, with at least one more element, no is a list containing integers from the input if x is not 1 or 2 and a, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less), i is max(big) + 1. If i is not in no, then num is max(big) + 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
