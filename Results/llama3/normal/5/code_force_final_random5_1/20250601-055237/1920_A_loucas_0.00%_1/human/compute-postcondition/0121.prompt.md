Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, num is 0, innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If x is 1, big is a list containing either one or more integers a, less is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers a, and no is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers from the input. If x is 2, big is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers a, less is a list containing either one, two, or more integers from the input, and no is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers from the input. If x is not 1 or 2, big is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers a, less is either an empty list or a list containing one or more integers from the input, and no is a list containing either one or more integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less), and innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case. If the current value of i is not in the set no, then num is equal to the current value of i. Otherwise, the value of num remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less) + 1, innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case. If the current value of i + 1 is not in the set no, then num is equal to the current value of i + 1. Otherwise, the value of num remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less) - 1, innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case. If the current value of i + 1 is not in the set no, then num is equal to the current value of i + 1. Otherwise, the value of num remains unchanged, i is max(big) + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
