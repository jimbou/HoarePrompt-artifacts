Postcondition: ***loop is at least 3, iterable is 1, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 1 and a, with at least one more element, less is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 2 and a, with at least one more element, no is a list containing integers from the input if x is not 1 or 2 and a, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less), i is max(big) + 1. If i is not in no, then num is max(big) + 1.***
