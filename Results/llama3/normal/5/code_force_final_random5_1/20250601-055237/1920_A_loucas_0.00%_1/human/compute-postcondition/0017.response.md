Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing a single integer `a`, `less` is a list containing the integer `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers `a`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is a list containing the integer `a`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `loop`, `stdin`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remains the same. The value of `x` and `a` also remains the same. However, the list `less` now contains the integer `a` regardless of the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, the list `big` still contains the integer `a` and `no` is still empty. If `x` is 2, the list `less` now contains two integers `a` and `big` is still empty and `no` is still empty. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, the list `less` now contains the integer `a`, `big` is still empty, and `no` still contains the integer `a`.
