To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(max(big), min(less)):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i`, `big`, and `less`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `max(big)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.


The state of `big` and `less` does not need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `max(big)` and `min(less)`, which are not changed by the loop iteration.


Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:


State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 1, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if `x` is 1 and `a`, `less` is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if `x` is 2 and `a`, `no` is a list containing integers from the input if `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a`, `num` is equal to `max(big) + 1` if `i` is not in the list `no`, `innerLoop` is the first integer `n` from the first test case, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, and `i` is equal to `max(big) + 1**
