Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `num` is equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to `max(big)` that is not in the set `no`.
* `max(big)` is less than or equal to `min(less)`, which means that `max(big)` is a value that is less than or equal to the smallest value in the `less` set.
* Since `num` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `max(big)` that is not in the set `no`, it means that `num` is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to `max(big)` and is not present in the `no` set.

Therefore, when the `print(num)` statement is executed, it will print the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to `max(big)` and is not present in the `no` set.

Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to max(big) that is not in the set no**
