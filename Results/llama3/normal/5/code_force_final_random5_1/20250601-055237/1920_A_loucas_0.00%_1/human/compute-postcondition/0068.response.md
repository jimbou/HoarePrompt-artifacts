Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 1, `iterable2` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1 and an integer from the input if `x` is 1 and `a`, `less` contains an integer from the input if `x` is 2 and `a`, `no` contains an integer from the input if `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a` and an integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` contains an integer from the input and `a`. Otherwise, `no` contains an integer from the input and `a` and another integer `a`.***
