Output State: **loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is 0, x is an integer from the input and is not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, a is an integer from the input, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is a list containing a single integer from the input, num is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case and is at least 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read)**

In natural language, the output state is: The loop counter is at least 2, the iterable variables are 1 and 0, the input integer x is not 1 or 2, the input integer a is stored, the lists less, big, and num remain empty, the list no now contains the input integer a, the inner loop counter is the first integer n from the first test case and is at least 1, and the standard input still contains multiple test cases with the first test case partially read.
