The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x, the integer read by `input()` is the number of test cases.

Output State: **`loop` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x.**
