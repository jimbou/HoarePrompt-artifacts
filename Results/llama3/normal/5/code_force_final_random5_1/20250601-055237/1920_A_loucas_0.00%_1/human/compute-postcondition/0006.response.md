The code `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the end of the list `big`. Since `big` is initially an empty list, it will now contain a single element, which is the value of `a`.

Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing a single integer `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is 0, `a` is an integer, and the current value of `x` is 1**
