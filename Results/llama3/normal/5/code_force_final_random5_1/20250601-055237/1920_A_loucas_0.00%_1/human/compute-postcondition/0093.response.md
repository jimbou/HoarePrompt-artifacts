Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input and not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one integer from the input, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read)**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. The value of `a` is an integer from the input, so the list `no` now contains one integer from the input. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, with the first test case partially read.
