Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 1, `iterable2` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1 and an integer from the input if `x` is 1, `less` contains an integer from the input if `x` is 2 and `a`, `no` contains an integer from the input if `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a` and another integer `a`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `iterable2`, `innerLoop`, and `num` remain unchanged. The value of `x` and `a` are still integers from the input. The list `big` still contains `a` if `x` is 1 and an integer from the input if `x` is 1. The list `less` still contains an integer from the input if `x` is 2 and `a`. The list `no` now contains an integer from the input if `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a`, and another integer `a` that was appended. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been partially read.
