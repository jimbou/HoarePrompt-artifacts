The only objects in the loop head are variables  i, big and less, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `big` and `less`. If `i` is less than `min(less)` and greater than `max(big)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not in `no`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in `less`, `less` is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in `big`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be increased by 1, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in `less`, `less` is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in `big`. 
State: **`loop` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), iterable is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in less, less is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in big, no is either an empty list or a list containing the integer a, i is increased by 1, num is set to i**
