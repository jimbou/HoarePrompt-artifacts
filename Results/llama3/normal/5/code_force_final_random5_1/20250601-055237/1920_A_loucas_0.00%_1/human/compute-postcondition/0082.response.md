Output: **loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 1 and a, less is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if x is 2 and a, no is a list containing integers from the input if x is not 1 or 2 and a, num is equal to the first integer in the range from max(big) to min(less) that is not in the list no, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), and the first integer in the range from max(big) to min(less) that is not in the list no is printed**
