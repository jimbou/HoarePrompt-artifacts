This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It categorizes the integers into three lists based on the value of a (1, 2, or 3), and then finds the first integer in the range from the maximum of the first list to the minimum of the second list that is not present in the third list. The function prints this integer for each test case.
