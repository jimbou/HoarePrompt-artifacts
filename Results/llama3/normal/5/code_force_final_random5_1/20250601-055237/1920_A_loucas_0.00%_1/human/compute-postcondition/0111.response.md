To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `big` and `less`. The loop will execute if `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`. 

State: **loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, num is 0, innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less)**
