According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop`. If `loop` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `loop` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x. So for the loop to be executed  the loop must be at least 1 and iterable is 0.
State: **`loop` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x, iterable is 0**
