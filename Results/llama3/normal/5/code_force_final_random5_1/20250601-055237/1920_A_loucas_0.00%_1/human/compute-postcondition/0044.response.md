To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `iterable2` and `innerLoop`. The loop will execute if `innerLoop` is at least 1.

State: **loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is 0, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case and is at least 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read)**
