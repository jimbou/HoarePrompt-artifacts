Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing one integer from the input, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing one integer from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `iterable2`, `num`, and `innerLoop` remain unchanged. The value of `x` and `a` also remain unchanged. The value of `big`, `less`, and `no` are updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` now contains two integers `a`. If `x` is 2, `big` remains empty. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` remains empty. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with the first test case partially read.
