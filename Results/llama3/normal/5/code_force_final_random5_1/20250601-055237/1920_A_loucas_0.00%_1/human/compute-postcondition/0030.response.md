Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in `less`, `less` is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in `big`. The current value of `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. The current value of `i` is not in `no`.***
