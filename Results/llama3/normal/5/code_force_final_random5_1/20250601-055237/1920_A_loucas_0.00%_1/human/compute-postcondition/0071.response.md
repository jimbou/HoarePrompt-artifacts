Postcondition: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 1, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if `x` is 1 and `a`, `less` is a non-empty list containing integers from the input if `x` is 2 and `a`, `no` is a list containing integers from the input if `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer `n` from the first test case, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, `i` is equal to `max(big)`, and the current value of `i` is not in the list `no`.**
