Postcondition: ***loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case and is at least 1, num is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If x is 1, big is a list containing one integer from the input, and less, no are empty lists. If x is 2, big is an empty list, less contains one integer from the input, and no is an empty list. If x is not 1 or 2, big is an empty list, less is an empty list, and no contains one integer from the input.***
