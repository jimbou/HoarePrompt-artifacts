Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is an empty list, less is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read).
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing one integer from the input, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing one integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing either one or two integers from the input, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer from the input. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing either one or two integers from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, `less` is a list containing either one, two, or three integers from the input, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer from the input. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer from the input, and `no` is a list containing either one or two integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
