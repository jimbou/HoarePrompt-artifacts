Postcondition: ***loop is at least 2, iterable is 1, iterable2 is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case and is at least 1, num is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read). If x is 2, a is an integer from the input and is added to the list less. If x is not 2, a is an integer from the input and is added to the list no. In both cases, big is an empty list.***
