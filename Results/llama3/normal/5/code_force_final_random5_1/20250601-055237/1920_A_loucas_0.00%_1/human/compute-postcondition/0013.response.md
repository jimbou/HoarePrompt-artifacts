Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing a single integer `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the integer `a`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.***
