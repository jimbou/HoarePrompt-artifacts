Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The issue lies in the line where it tries to find the first number that is not in the "no" list:

`for i in range(max(big), min(less)): if i not in no: num = i break`

This line of code only finds the first number that is not in the "no" list, but it does not count the total number of integers that satisfy all constraints. It simply assigns the first such number to the variable "num" and breaks the loop.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should count the total number of integers in the range from max(big) to min(less) that are not in the "no" list. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        for i in range(max(big), min(less) + 1):
            if i not in no:
                num += 1
        print(num)
```

This corrected version of the program correctly counts the total number of integers that satisfy all constraints.
