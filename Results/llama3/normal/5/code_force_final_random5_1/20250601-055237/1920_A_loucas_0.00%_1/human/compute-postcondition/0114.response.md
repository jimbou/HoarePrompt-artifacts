Postcondition: ***loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less), and innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case. If the current value of i is not in the set no, then num is equal to the current value of i. Otherwise, the value of num remains unchanged.***
