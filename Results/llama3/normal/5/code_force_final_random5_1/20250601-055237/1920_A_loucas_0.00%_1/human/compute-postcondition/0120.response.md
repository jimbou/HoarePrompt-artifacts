Postcondition: ***loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), max(big) is less than min(less) - 1, innerLoop is the first integer from the first test case. If the current value of i + 1 is not in the set no, then num is equal to the current value of i + 1. Otherwise, the value of num remains unchanged, i is max(big) + 1***
