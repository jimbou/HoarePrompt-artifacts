Postcondition: ***loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case, iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, big is either an empty list or a list containing an integer less than the minimum integer in less, less is a list containing at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in big, no is either an empty list or a list containing the integer a. If i is not in no, then i is increased by 1 and num is equal to i. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
