The code prints the value of `num`, which is equal to `i`. The value of `i` is determined by the condition: if `i` is not in `no`, then `i` is equal to `min(less) - 1`. Since `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`, and `i` is not in `no`, `i` is equal to `min(less) - 1`. The list `less` contains at least one integer greater than the maximum integer in `big`, so `min(less)` is the smallest integer in `less`. Therefore, `i` is equal to `min(less) - 1`, which is one less than the smallest integer in `less`.

Output: **min(less) - 1 (where min(less) is the smallest integer in the list less)**
