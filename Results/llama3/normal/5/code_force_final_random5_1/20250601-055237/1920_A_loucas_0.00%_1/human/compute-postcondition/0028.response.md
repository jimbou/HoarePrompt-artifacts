Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing either one, two or `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, either `less` is a list containing one or two integers `a` and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or lists containing the integer `a` or `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing either one, two or `innerLoop` integers `a`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, with `iterable2` being equal to `innerLoop`, which represents the number of iterations. The values of `x` and `a` are the last integers read from the input. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` contain the accumulated values based on the values of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains all the integers `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` contains one, two, or all the integers `a`, and `big` and `no` may contain one integer `a` or be empty. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` and `big` may contain one or two integers `a`, and `no` contains one, two, or all the integers `a`.
