Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), iterable is 0, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is the first integer n from the first test case
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing a single integer `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the integer `a`, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, either `less` is a list containing the integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists or `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the first integer n from the first test case, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three integers `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing either one, two or three integers `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, either `less` is a list containing one or two integers `a` and `big` and `no` are either empty lists or lists containing the integer `a` or `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing either one, two or three integers `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
