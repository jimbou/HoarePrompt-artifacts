Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first test case partially read)**

The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `a`, respectively. Since `x` and `a` were already integers from the input, their values are updated to the new input values. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been partially read.
