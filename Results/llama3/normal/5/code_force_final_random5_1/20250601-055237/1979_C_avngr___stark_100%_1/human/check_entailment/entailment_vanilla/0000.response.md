Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, where gcd is the greatest common divisor. func_2 calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying func_1 to the first two numbers, then the result and the next number, and so on.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the LCM of the multipliers using func_2, and then distributes the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is equal to the LCM minus 1. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program assumes that the LCM of the multipliers is always greater than the sum of the multipliers. This is not necessarily true. For example, if the multipliers are 2, 2, and 2, the LCM is 2, which is not greater than the sum of the multipliers (6).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
