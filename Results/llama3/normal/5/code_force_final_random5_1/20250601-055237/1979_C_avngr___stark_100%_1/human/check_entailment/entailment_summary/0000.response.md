Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for each outcome.

`func_1` calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor. This function is used by `func_2` to calculate the LCM of all the numbers in the list.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome. It then calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2` and distributes the coins among the outcomes by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. If the total amount of coins distributed is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the distributed coins for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
