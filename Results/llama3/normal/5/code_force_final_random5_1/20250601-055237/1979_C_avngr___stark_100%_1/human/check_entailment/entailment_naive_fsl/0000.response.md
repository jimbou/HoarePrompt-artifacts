Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem requires determining how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. However, the provided program does not attempt to solve this problem. It defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the least common multiple of two numbers and the least common multiple of a list of numbers, respectively. These functions do not address the problem of distributing coins to come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

A correct solution would involve finding a way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The provided program does not attempt to do this.

For example, if the input is `n = 3` and `k = [3, 2, 7]`, the program should output a distribution of coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program does not provide any output for this input.
