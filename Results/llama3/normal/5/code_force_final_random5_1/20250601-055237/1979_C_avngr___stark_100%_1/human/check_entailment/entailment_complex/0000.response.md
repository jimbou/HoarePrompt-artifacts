Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining how to distribute coins in a game with n possible outcomes, each with a multiplier k_i. The goal is to bet a certain amount of coins on each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The provided code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the absolute value of the product of two positive integers a and b, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). `func_2` takes a list of two or more non-negative integers as input and returns a value that is the result of iteratively applying the `func_1` function to the first element of the list and each subsequent element.

The main code reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes n and the multipliers k_i. It then calls `func_2` with the list of multipliers k_i and stores the result in m. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing m by the corresponding multiplier k_i and stores them in the list c.

If the sum of the bets in c is greater than or equal to m, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The code correctly implements the problem's requirements. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using `func_2`, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier, ensuring that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the code is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
