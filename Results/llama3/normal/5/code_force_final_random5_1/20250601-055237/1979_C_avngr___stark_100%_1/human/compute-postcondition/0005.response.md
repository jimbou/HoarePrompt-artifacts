To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `numbers`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the list `numbers`. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the third element in the list, and `numbers` has at least three elements.

For the loop to execute again, `numbers` must have at least four elements, and `num` must be the fourth element in the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of four or more non-negative integers, `result` is equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the first element of `numbers` and the second element in the list, and the third element in the list, `num` is the fourth element in the list**
