To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]:`, which means we're iterating over the elements of the `numbers` list, starting from the second element (index 1).

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `numbers` is a list of two or more non-negative integers.
* `result` is equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the first element of `numbers` and the second element in the list.
* `num` is the second element in the list.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when we move to the next element in the list. Since we're iterating over `numbers[1:]`, the next element will be the third element in the original list (index 2).

Here's the updated state:

* `numbers` is still a list of two or more non-negative integers (no change).
* `result` is not affected by the loop iteration, so its value remains the same.
* `num` will now be the third element in the list (index 2).

State: **`numbers` is a list of two or more non-negative integers, `result` is equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the first element of `numbers` and the second element in the list, `num` is the third element in the list**
