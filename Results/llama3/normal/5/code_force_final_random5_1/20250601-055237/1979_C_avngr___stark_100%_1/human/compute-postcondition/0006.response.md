Output State: **`numbers` is a list of four or more non-negative integers, `result` is equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the first element of `numbers` and the second element in the list, and the third element in the list, and the fourth element in the list, `num` is the fourth element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `result` (which was the result of calling `func_1` with the first three elements of `numbers`) and the fourth element of `numbers` (`num`). The other variables remain unchanged.
