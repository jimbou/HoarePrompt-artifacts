Output State: **`numbers` is a list of two or more non-negative integers, `result` is equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the value returned by `func_1` with arguments equal to the first element of `numbers` and the second element in the list, and the third element in the list, `num` is the third element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `result` has been updated to be the result of calling `func_1` with the previous value of `result` (which was the result of calling `func_1` with the first two elements of `numbers`) and the third element of `numbers`. The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.
