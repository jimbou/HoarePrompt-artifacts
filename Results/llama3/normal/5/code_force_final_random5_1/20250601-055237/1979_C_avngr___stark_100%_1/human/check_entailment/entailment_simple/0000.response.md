Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the given multipliers. 

The main part of the program iterates over each test case, calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`, and then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. Then, it calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier, which ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
