According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is equal to the first element of `numbers`. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second element in the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of two or more non-negative integers, `result` is equal to the first element of `numbers`, num is the second element in the list**
