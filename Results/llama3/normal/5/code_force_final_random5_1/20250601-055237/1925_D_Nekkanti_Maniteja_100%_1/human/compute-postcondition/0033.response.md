Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a * k + c * m * c * (k * (k-1) // 2)`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+2` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

- The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times.
- The value of `k` is now greater than or equal to 0, as it was initially.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the loop.
- The value of `s` has been updated to include the sum of the products of `c`, `a`, and `k`, as well as the sum of the products of `c`, `m`, `c`, and the sum of the first `k-1` integers (i.e., `k * (k-1) // 2`).
- The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, minus `m+k+2` test cases.
