Output State: **i is 2, k is an integer, n is an integer, m is greater than 2, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 2 times the original value of f plus the new value of f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m+k+4 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `a` is updated to be twice the original value of `f` plus the new value of `f`, which is obtained from the input. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to the new values obtained from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1 due to the `input()` function being called.
