Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `k*c * c * m + k*c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `m+k` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times.
- The value of `k` is now greater than or equal to 0, as it has been decremented `k` times.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
- The value of `s` has been updated to `k*c * c * m + k*c * a`, which is the result of adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s` for each iteration of the loop.
- The value of `a` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
- The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by `m+k` test cases.
