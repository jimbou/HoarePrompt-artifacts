Output State: **i is k+1, k is an integer, n is an integer, m is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m+k+4 test cases**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `k` is now an integer, as it was assigned a value from the input. The value of `n` is also an integer, as it was assigned a value from the input. The value of `m` is an integer, as it was assigned a value from the input. The value of `M` is now 1000000007, as it was reassigned a new value. The value of `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, as it was recalculated based on the new values of `n` and `M`. The value of `s` is now 0, as it was reassigned a new value. The value of `a` is now 0, as it was reassigned a new value. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, as one test case was consumed by the input operation.
