Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * m * c * i`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+2` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the product of `c`, `a`, and `c * m * c * i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+2` test cases.
