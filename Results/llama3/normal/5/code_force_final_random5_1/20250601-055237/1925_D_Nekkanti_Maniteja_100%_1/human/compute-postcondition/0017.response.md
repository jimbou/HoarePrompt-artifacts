Output: **`i` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `k*c * c * m + k*c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `m+k` test cases, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed**
