According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which is the initial value for the loop variable. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0**
