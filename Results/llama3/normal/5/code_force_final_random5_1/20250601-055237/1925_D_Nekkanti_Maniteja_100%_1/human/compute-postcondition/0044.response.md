Output State: **i is m, k is an integer, n is an integer, m is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 modulo M, s is 0, a is the sum of all f values, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m+k+4 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` is equal to the number of iterations `m`, the value of `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, and the other variables remain unchanged.
