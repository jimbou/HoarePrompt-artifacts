Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `2*c * c * m + 2*c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `m+1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `2*c * c * m + 2*c * a` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value, where `i` is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
