Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * m * (c * 0 + a) + c * 1 * c * m + c * a + c * 2 * c * m + c * a + ... + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+4` test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k-1`, and the variable `s` will be the sum of the terms `c * m * (c * 0 + a)`, `c * 1 * c * m + c * a`, `c * 2 * c * m + c * a`, and so on, up to `c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
