Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * m * (c * 0 + a) + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+4` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been updated to include an additional term `c * i * c * m + c * a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+4` test cases.
