Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 modulo 10^9 + 7, sums up all f_i values, and then computes a value s based on these calculations. The function prints the value of s modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case.**
