Output State: **i is 1, k is an integer, n is an integer, m is greater than 1, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 modulo M, s is 0, a is f + the original value of f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m+k+3 test cases.**

The code executes in the following way: The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `u`, `v`, and `f`. Since `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+2` test cases, after this line, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+3` test cases. The second line increments `a` by the value of `f`. Since `a` was originally equal to `f`, `a` becomes `f + the original value of f`. No other variables are affected.
