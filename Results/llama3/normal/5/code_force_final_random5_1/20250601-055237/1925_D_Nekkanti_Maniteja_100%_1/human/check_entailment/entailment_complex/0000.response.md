Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).
2. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.
3. The program correctly sums up all the friendship values (f_i) for each pair of friends.
4. The program then calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion, taking into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the increase in friendship value for each subsequent excursion.
5. Finally, the program prints the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the mathematical formulas required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
