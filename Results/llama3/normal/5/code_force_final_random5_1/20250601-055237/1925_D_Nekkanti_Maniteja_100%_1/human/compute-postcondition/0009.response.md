To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is `m-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the initial value of the range). Additionally, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `m` test cases**
