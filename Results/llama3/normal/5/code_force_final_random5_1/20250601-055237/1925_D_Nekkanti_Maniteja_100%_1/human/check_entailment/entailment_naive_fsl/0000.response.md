Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the line where the sum `s` is calculated. The correct formula for the expected value should be the sum of the probabilities of each pair being chosen multiplied by their friendship value, plus the sum of the probabilities of each pair being chosen in the previous excursion multiplied by their increased friendship value.

However, the program calculates `s` as `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, which is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` is not necessary and the term `c * a` should be multiplied by the probability of each pair being chosen, which is `c`.

A correct implementation would be to calculate the expected value as follows:

`s = 0`
`for i in range(k):`
    `s += c * a + c * i * c * m`
    `a += c * m`

This way, the program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Note: The variable `a` is used to keep track of the sum of the friendship values of all pairs, and `c` is the probability of each pair being chosen.
