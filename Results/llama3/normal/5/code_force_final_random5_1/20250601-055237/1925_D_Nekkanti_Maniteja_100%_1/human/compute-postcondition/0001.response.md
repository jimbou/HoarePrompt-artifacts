Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 0**

In this output state, the first line of the code reads a test case from stdin, reducing the number of test cases by one. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input. The second line assigns the value of `10 ** 9 + 7` to `M`. The third line calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. The fourth and fifth lines initialize `s` and `a` to 0, respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
