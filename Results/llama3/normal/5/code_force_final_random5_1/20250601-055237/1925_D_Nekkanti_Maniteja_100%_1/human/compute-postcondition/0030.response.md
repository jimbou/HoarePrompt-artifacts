Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * m * c * i + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+2` test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+2` test cases.
