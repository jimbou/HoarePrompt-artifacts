Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * a + c * c * m + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `m+1` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the additional terms `c * i * c * m` and another `c * a`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now a more complex expression involving the modular multiplicative inverse `c`, the sum of all `f` values `a`, and the integer `m`.
