Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 0, n is an integer, m must be greater than 0, k is an integer, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2 modulo M, s is 0, a is f, u is an integer, v is an integer, f is an integer.**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to u, v, and f. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, after reading three integers, stdin will contain multiple test cases minus two test cases. The value of a is incremented by f, so a becomes equal to f. The values of i, n, m, k, M, c, and s remain unchanged.
