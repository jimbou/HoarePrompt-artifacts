Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n*(n-1)//2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * m * (c * 0 + a)`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+4` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the product of `c`, `m`, and the sum of `c` multiplied by `i` (which is 0) and `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `m+k+4` test cases.
