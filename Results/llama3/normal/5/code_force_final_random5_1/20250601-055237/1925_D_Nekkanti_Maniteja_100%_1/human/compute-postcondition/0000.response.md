The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and the input to the `range()` function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input to the `range()` function. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the input to the `range()` function is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `i` is 0**
