Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input hour is '00'. According to the problem description, '00' in 24-hour format should be converted to '12' in 12-hour format, but the program incorrectly assigns 'PM' to it. It should be 'AM' instead.

For example, the input '00:59' should be converted to '12:59 AM', but the program outputs '12:59 PM'.
