The code prints the time in 12-hour format. The hour part is represented by `h1`, which is the same as `h` if `h` is between '01' and '11', and '12' if `h` is '12'. If `h` is between '13' and '23', `h1` is the hour part modulo 12, with '00' becoming '12'. The minute part is represented by `m`. The time of day is represented by `time`, which is 'AM' if `h` is between '01' and '11', and 'PM' if `h` is between '13' and '23'. If `h` is '12', `time` is 'AM' if `m` is '00', and 'PM' otherwise.

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where h1 is the hour part in 12-hour format, m is the minute part, and time is the time of day)**
