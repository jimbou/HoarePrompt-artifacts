To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`, which should contain a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) followed by `t` strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.

State: **stdin contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) followed by t strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 0**
