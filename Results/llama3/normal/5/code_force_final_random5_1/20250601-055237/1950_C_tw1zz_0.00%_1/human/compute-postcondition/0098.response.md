Output: **h is a string, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '01', time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is not '01', time and h1 are determined based on the value of h: if h is '02', time is 'AM' and h1 is '02'; if h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h; if h is not '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', time is 'PM' and h1 is the corresponding 12-hour format of h, unless h is '00', in which case time is 'AM' and h1 is '12', and this is printed: the 12-hour format of h (h1) followed by a colon, followed by the minute part of the input time (m), followed by a space, followed by the time of day (time) (AM or PM)**
