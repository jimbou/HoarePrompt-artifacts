The code prints a time in the 12-hour format, where the hour part is represented by the variable h1, the minute part is represented by the variable m, and the time of day (AM or PM) is represented by the variable time.

The value of h1 depends on the value of the variable h. If h is '01', then h1 is '01'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is the same as h. If h is '00', then h1 is '12'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively.

The value of m is the minute part of the input time.

The value of time depends on the value of the variable h. If h is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM'. If h is '00', then time is 'PM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then time is 'PM'.

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where h1 is the hour part of the time in 12-hour format, m is the minute part of the time, and time is the time of day, either AM or PM)**
