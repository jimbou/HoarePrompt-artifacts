Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The program takes a string input in the format "hh:mm" and outputs the equivalent time in 12-hour format as "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".

The program uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the hour part of the time in 12-hour format. For hours 01 to 11, the hour part remains the same, and the time is set to 'AM'. For hours 13 to 23, the hour part is converted to 01 to 11, and the time is set to 'PM'. For hour 00, the hour part is set to 12, and the time is set to 'PM'. For hour 12, the hour part remains the same, and the time is set to 'PM'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. For hour 00, the time should be set to 'AM', not 'PM'. This is because 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format, not 12:00 PM.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
