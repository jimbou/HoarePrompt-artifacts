Converts 24-hour time to 12-hour time format. Accepts a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) followed by t strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. For each input time, it converts the hour part to 12-hour format, determines whether the time is AM or PM, and prints the time in 12-hour format (hh:mm AM/PM). The function does not return any value but prints the converted time for each input.
