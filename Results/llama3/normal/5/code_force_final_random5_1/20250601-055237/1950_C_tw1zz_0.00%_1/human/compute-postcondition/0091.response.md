Postcondition: ***h is a string, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '06', time is 'AM' and h1 is '06'. If h is '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is not '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', time is 'PM' and h1 is the corresponding 12-hour format of h, unless h is '00', in which case time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'.***
