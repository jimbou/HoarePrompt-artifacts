Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format. It takes a string input in the format "hh:mm" and outputs the equivalent time in 12-hour format with AM/PM.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program uses a for loop to iterate over the number of test cases specified in the first line of input.

2. Inside the loop, it takes a string input representing the time in 24-hour format and splits it into hours (h) and minutes (m) using the colon (:) as the separator.

3. It then checks the value of the hour (h) using a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and whether it's AM or PM.

4. If the hour is between 01 and 11, it sets the time to AM. If the hour is 12, it sets the time to PM. If the hour is between 13 and 23, it subtracts 12 from the hour to get the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and sets the time to PM. If the hour is 00, it sets the hour to 12 and the time to AM.

5. Finally, it prints the equivalent time in 12-hour format with AM/PM.

However, there is a logical error in the program. When the hour is 00, it sets the time to PM, which is incorrect. It should set the time to AM.

Correctness: **False**
