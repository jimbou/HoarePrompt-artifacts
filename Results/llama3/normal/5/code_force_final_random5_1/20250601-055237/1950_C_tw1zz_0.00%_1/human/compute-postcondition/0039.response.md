Output State: **h is '13', m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, time is 'PM', h1 is '01', stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

The code assigns the string '01' to the variable h1 and the string 'PM' to the variable time. The values of h, m, m1, and stdin remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
