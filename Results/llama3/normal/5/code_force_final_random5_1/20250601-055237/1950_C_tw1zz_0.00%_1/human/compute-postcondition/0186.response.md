Postcondition: ***h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, stdin contains t-3 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '15', then h1 is '03' and time is 'PM'. If h is '16', then h1 is '04' and time is 'PM'. If h is '17', then h1 is '05' and time is 'PM'. If h is '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then h1 is '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively and time is 'PM'. If h is not '15' and not in the range '16' to '23' or '00', then h1 and time remain unchanged.***
