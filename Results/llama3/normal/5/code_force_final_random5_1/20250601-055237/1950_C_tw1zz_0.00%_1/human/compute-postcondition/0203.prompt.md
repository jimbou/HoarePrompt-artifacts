Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) followed by t strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: h is a string, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '01', time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is not '01', time and h1 are determined based on the value of h: if h is '02', time is 'AM' and h1 is '02'; if h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h; if h is not '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', time is 'PM' and h1 is the corresponding 12-hour format of h, unless h is '00', in which case time is 'AM' and h1 is '12', and this is printed: the 12-hour format of h (h1) followed by a colon, followed by the minute part of the input time (m), followed by a space, followed by the time of day (time) (AM or PM)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: h is a string, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '01', then h1 is '01' and time is 'AM'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is the same as h and time is 'AM'. If h is '00', then h1 is '12' and time is 'PM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively and time is 'PM', and the time in 12-hour format is printed, where the hour is h1 and the minute is m, and the time of day is time

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, stdin contains t-3 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '01', then h1 is '01' and time is 'AM'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is the same as h and time is 'AM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively and time is 'PM'; otherwise, h1 and time remain unchanged. The time in 12-hour format is printed, where h1 is the hour part, m is the minute part, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
