Output State: **h is '12', m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, time is 'AM', h1 is '12', stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

The code assigns the value '12' to the variable h1 and the string 'AM' to the variable time. The values of h, m, m1, and stdin remain unchanged.
