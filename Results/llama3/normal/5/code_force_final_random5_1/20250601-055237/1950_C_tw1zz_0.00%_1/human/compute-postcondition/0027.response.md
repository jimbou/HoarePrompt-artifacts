Output State: **h is '09', m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, time is 'AM', h1 is '09', stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

In this output state, the value of `h` remains '09' as it was in the initial state. The values of `m` and `m1` also remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The variable `time` is assigned the value 'AM'. A new variable `h1` is introduced and assigned the value '09'. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
