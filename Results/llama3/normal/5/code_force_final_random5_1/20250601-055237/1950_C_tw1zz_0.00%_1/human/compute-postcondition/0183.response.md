If h is '18', then h1 is '06' and time is 'PM'. If h is '19', then h1 is '07' and time is 'PM'. If h is '20', then h1 is '08' and time is 'PM'. If h is '21', then h1 is '09' and time is 'PM'. If h is '22', then h1 is '10' and time is 'PM'. If h is '23', then h1 is '11' and time is 'PM'. If h is '00', then h1 is '12' and time is 'PM'. Otherwise, h1 and time remain unchanged.**
