The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '01' to the variable `h1`. The second line assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. 

Since `h1` was an empty string, it now becomes '01'. The variable `time` was also an empty string, and it now becomes 'PM'. No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **h is a string, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, h1 is '01', time is 'PM', stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**
