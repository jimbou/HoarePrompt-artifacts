Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, h1 is '09', time is 'PM', stdin contains t-3 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

The code assigns the value '09' to h1 and 'PM' to time. The values of h, m, m1, and stdin remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
