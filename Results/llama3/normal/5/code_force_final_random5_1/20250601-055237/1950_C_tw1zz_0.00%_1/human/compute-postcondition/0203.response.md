Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, stdin is empty. If h is '01', then h1 is '01' and time is 'AM'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is the same as h and time is 'AM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively and time is 'PM'; otherwise, h1 and time remain unchanged. The time in 12-hour format is printed, where h1 is the hour part, m is the minute part, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour part.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input has been fully processed and the output is the time in 12-hour format for each input time. The hour part (h1) and the time of day (time) are determined based on the original hour part (h) of the input time. The minute part (m) remains unchanged. The input stream (stdin) is empty, indicating that all input times have been processed.
