Output State: **h is '00', m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, time is 'PM', h1 is '12'**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value to a variable. The first line assigns the string '12' to the variable h1. The second line assigns the string 'PM' to the variable time. The initial state of the variables h, m, and m1 remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The variable h still holds the value '00', and the variables m and m1 still hold the minute part of the input time. The variable time, which was initially an empty string, now holds the value 'PM'. The variable h1, which was not present in the initial state, is introduced and assigned the value '12'.
