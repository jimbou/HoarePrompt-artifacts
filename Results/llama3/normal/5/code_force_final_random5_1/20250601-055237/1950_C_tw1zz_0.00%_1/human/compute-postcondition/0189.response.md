Postcondition: ***h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, stdin contains t-3 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '12', then h1 is '12' and time is 'AM'. If h is not '12', then h1 and time are updated based on the value of h: if h is '13', then h1 is '01' and time is 'PM'; if h is '14', then h1 is '02' and time is 'PM'; if h is '15', then h1 is '03' and time is 'PM'; if h is '16', then h1 is '04' and time is 'PM'; if h is '17', then h1 is '05' and time is 'PM'; if h is '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then h1 is '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively and time is 'PM'; otherwise, h1 and time remain unchanged.***
