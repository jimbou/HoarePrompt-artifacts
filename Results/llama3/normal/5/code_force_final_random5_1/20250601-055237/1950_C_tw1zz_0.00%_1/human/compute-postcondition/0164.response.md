The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign new values to existing variables.

The first line assigns the string '12' to the variable h1. This means that h1 is no longer an empty string, but now holds the value '12'.

The second line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable time. This means that time is no longer an empty string, but now holds the value 'AM'.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The values of h, m, m1, and stdin remain unchanged.

Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m is the minute part of the input time, m1 is the minute part of the input time, h1 is '12', time is 'AM', stdin contains t-3 strings, each of length 5, in the format hh:mm, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**
