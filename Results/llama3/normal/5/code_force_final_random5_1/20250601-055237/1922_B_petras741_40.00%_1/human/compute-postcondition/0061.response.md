Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `eta` is an empty list, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` and the rest are 0 for all `j` in range `n`, `j` is `n`.**

The code `eta = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `eta`, effectively clearing its previous contents. The other variables remain unchanged, so their values are still valid. The output state reflects the updated value of `eta` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
