To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of `t*n - 1` integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains `t*n - 2` integers, `j` is 1**
