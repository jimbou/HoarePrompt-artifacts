Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of `t*n - 1` integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1, the value at index `w[1]` is 1, the value at index `w[2]` is 1, and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is 1 + `q[eta[1]]` + `q[eta[j]]`, `res` is `q[eta[1]]` * (`q[eta[1]]` - 1) * (`q[eta[1]]` - 2) // 6 + `q[eta[1]]` * (`q[eta[1]]` - 1) // 2 * `rho` + `q[eta[j]]` * (`q[eta[j]]` - 1) * (`q[eta[j]]` - 2) // 6 + `q[eta[j]]` * (`q[eta[j]]` - 1) // 2 * `rho`, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
