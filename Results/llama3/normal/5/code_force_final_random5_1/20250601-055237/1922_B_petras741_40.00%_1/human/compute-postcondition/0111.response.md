Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 6` integers, `eta` is an empty list, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `eta` is now empty, as it has been reassigned to an empty list. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
