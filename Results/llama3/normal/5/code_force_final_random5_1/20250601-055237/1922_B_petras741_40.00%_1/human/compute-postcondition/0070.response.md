Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` and the rest are 0 for all `j` in range `n`, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing 0, 2 and 3.**

The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is 3, the list `eta` now contains 0, 2, and 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
