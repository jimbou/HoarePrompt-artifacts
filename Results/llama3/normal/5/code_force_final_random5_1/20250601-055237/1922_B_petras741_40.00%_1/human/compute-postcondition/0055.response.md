Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1. The value of `i` remains 1. The `buffer` list remains empty. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 0. The list `w` still contains `n` integers. The `stdin` still contains `t*n - 3` integers. The list `eta` still contains the values 0, 1, and 2. The value of `rho` remains 1. The list `q` now contains `n+1` integers, where the value at the index specified by the first element of list `w` (since `j` is 0) is incremented by 1, and the rest of the elements are 0. The value of `j` remains 0.
