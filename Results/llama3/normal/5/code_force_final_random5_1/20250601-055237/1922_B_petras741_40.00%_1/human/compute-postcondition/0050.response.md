Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of t*n - 1 integers, stdin contains t*n - 2 integers. If n is greater than or equal to 3, then q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index w[0] is 1, the value at index w[1] is 1, the value at index w[2] is 1, and the rest are 0, stdin contains t*n - n integers, eta is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, rho is 1, and either the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements, which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6, is being printed if eta_ln is 1, or res is q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) // 2 * rho is being printed and j is 0 if eta_ln is greater than 1. If n is less than 3, then 0 is being printed.**
