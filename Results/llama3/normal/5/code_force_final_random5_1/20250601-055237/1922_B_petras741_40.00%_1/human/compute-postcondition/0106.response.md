The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 6` integers, `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 1**
