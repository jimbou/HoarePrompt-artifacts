Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 6` integers, `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 2 and `q[w[1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `q[w[1]]` being 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
