Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer less than 3, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 3 integers, eta is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, rho is 1, and either the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements, which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6, is being printed if eta_ln is 1, or res is q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) // 2 * rho is being printed and j is 0 if eta_ln is greater than 1. 0 is being printed.**
