The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a mathematical formula for calculating the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, the expression will evaluate to a specific integer value. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical result.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the formula `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
