Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[2]` is 3 and the rest are 0, `j` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `q` at index `w[2]` has been incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
