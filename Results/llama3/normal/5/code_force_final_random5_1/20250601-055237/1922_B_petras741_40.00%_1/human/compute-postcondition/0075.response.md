The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a mathematical formula for calculating the number of combinations of 3 items from a set of `n` items.

Since `n` is an integer, the expression will evaluate to an integer value. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, where `n` is the value of the variable `n`.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the value of the variable n)**
