Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of `t*n - 1` integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains `t*n - 2` integers, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1, where `w[j]` is the first element of the list `w` (since `j` is 0). The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `q` now has a 1 at the index specified by the first element of `w`, and the rest of its elements are still 0.
