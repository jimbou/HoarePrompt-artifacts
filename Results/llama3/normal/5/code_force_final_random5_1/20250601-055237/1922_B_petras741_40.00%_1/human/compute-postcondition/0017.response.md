To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of `t*n - 1` integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1, the value at index `w[1]` is 1, the value at index `w[2]` is 1, and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains `t*n - n` integers, `j` is 1. If the value at index `j` in `q` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
