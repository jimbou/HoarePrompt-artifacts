Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 3 integers, rho is j+1 where j is the index in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 and the rest are 0 for all j in range n, j is n, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, and the current value of eta_ln is 1, meaning there is exactly one index j in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, and the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 is being printed**
