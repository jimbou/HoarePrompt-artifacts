Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` and the rest are 0 for all `j` in range `n`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the indices `j` in range `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `eta` will contain all the indices `j` in the range of `n` where the value of `q[j]` is greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
