Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 6 integers, rho is 1, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is 1 for all j in range(n), j is n, and eta is a list containing the integers from 0 to n. If eta_ln is 1, then the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements, n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6, is printed. Otherwise, rho is 1 + sum(q[eta[j]] for j in range(1, eta_ln)), res is sum(q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 + sum(q[eta[k]] for k in range(1, j))) for j in range(1, eta_ln)), and j is equal to eta_ln, and res is printed.**
