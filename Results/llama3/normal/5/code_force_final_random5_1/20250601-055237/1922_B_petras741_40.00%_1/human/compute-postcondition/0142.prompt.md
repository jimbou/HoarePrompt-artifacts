Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains `t*n - 6` integers, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n`, `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, and `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 6 integers, rho is 1 + q[eta[j]], q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is 1 for all j in range(n), eta is a list containing the integers from 0 to n, eta_ln is at least 2, and res is q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho. If j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 6 integers, rho is 1 + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]], q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is 1 for all j in range(n), eta is a list containing the integers from 0 to n, eta_ln is at least 2, res is q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]) + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 + q[eta[j]]), and j is 3. If j > 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 6 integers, eta is a list containing the integers from 0 to n, eta_ln is at least 5, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is 1 for all j in range(n), rho is 1 + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]], res is q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]) + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]) + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]), and j is 4. If j > 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
