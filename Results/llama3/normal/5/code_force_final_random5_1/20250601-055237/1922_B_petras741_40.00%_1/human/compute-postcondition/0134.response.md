To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is: `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`

The objects in the loop head are `j` and `eta_ln`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `eta_ln`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2 (since it started from 1 and incremented by 1). For the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.

The state of `eta_ln` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 6` integers, `rho` is 1 + `q[eta[j]]`, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), `eta` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n`, `eta_ln` is at least 2, `res` is `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `j` is 3.**
