Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of `t*n - 1` integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1, the value at index `w[1]` is 1, the value at index `w[2]` is 1, and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains `t*n - n` integers, `j` is 2, and `eta` is a list containing the values 1 and 2.**

The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is 2 and the value at index `j` in `q` is 1 (which is greater than 0), `eta` initially contains the value 1. After the code is executed, `eta` now contains the values 1 and 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
