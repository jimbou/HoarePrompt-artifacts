stdin contains t+2t lines, where t is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^4. The first line contains t. Each of the following t lines contains an integer n, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3*10^5. Each of the following t lines contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.
