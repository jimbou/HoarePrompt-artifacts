Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains `t*n - 3` integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` and the rest are 0 for all `j` in range `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the indices `j` in range `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is at least 3, `res` is the product of the first three consecutive integers starting from `q[eta[0]]` divided by 6 plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is `j+1` where `j` is the index in range `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0 plus `q[eta[j]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted by the break statement.
