The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` and the rest are 0 for all `j` in range `n`, `j` is 3. If the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` is a list containing 0 and 2. Otherwise, `eta` is an empty list.**
