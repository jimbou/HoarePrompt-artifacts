Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of `t*n - 1` integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2, the value at index `w[1]` is 1, the value at index `w[2]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[2]]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in the value at index `w[2]` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
