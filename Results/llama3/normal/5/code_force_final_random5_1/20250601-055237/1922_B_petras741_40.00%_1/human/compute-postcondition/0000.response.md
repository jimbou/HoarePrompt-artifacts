The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is a positive integer, `t` becomes the first integer from stdin. The second line creates an empty list called `buffer`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains 2*t*n - 1 integers**
