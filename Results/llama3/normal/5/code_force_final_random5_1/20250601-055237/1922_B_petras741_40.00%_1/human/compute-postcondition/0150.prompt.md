Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains 2*t*n - 1 integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of t*n - 1 integers, stdin contains t*n - 2 integers. If n is greater than or equal to 3, then q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at index w[0] is 1, the value at index w[1] is 1, the value at index w[2] is 1, and the rest are 0, stdin contains t*n - n integers, eta is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, rho is 1, and either the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements, which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6, is being printed if eta_ln is 1, or res is q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) // 2 * rho is being printed and j is 0 if eta_ln is greater than 1. If n is less than 3, then 0 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 3 integers, eta is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, rho is 1. If n is less than 3, 0 is being printed. If n is greater than or equal to 3, then if there is exactly one index j in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 is printed. Otherwise, res is the product of the first three consecutive integers starting from q[eta[0]] divided by 6 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range 1 to min(eta_ln, 1001), rho is j+1 where j is the index in range n where q[j] is greater than 0 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range 1 to min(eta_ln, 1001), j is min(eta_ln, 1001), and res is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 6 integers, eta is a list containing the integers from 0 to n, and rho is 1. If n is less than 3, 0 is printed. If n is 3 or more, a list q of n+1 integers is created where q[w[j]] is 1 for all j in range(n), and j is n. If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements, n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6, is printed. Otherwise, rho is 1 + sum(q[eta[j]] for j in range(1, eta_ln)), res is sum(q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 + sum(q[eta[k]] for k in range(1, j))) for j in range(1, eta_ln)), and j is equal to eta_ln, and res is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
