Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of `t*n - 1` integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1, the value at index `w[1]` is 1, the value at index `w[2]` is 1, and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains `t*n - n` integers, `j` is 0, `eta` is a list containing the value 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `buffer` is still an empty list, `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is still a list of `t*n - 1` integers, `q` is still a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1, the value at index `w[1]` is 1, the value at index `w[2]` is 1, and the rest are 0, `stdin` still contains `t*n - n` integers, `j` is still 0, and `eta` now contains the value 0.
