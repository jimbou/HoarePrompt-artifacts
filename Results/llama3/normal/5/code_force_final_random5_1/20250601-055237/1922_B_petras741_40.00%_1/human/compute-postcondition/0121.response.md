Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 6` integers, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), and `j` is 2. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 2. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.***
