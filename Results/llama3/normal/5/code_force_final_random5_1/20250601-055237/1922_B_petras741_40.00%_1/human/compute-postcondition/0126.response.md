Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 6 integers, rho is 1, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is 1 for all j in range(n), j is n, and eta is a list containing the integers from 0 to n. The current value of eta_ln is 1., and this is printed: n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 which is the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements**
