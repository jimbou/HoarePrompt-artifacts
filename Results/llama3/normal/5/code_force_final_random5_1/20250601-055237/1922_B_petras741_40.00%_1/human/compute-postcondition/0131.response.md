Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 6 integers, rho is 1 + q[eta[j]], q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is 1 for all j in range(n), j is greater than 1000, eta is a list containing the integers from 0 to n, eta_ln is at least 2, and res is q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho**
