Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 6` integers, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list containing the integer 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the integer 1, in addition to the integer 0 that was already present if `q[0]` was greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
