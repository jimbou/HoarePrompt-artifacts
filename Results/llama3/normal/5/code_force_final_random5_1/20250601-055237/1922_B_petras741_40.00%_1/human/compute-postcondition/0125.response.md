The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a mathematical formula for calculating the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time.

Since `n` is an integer, the expression will evaluate to an integer value. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means that the result will be an integer, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the output will be the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, calculated using the formula `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

Output: **the number of combinations of n items taken 3 at a time (where n is the value of n)**
