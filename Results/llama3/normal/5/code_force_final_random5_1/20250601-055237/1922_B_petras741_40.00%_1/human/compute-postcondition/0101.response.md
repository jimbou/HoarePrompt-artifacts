The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 4` integers, `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 1**
