Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 6` integers, `eta` is a list containing the integer 0, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), and `q[0]` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 2. The value of `i` remains 2. The `buffer` list remains empty. The value of `n` remains an integer that must be at least 0. The `w` list remains a list of `n` integers. The `stdin` contains `t*n - 6` integers. The `eta` list now contains the integer 0. The value of `rho` remains 1. The `q` list remains a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), and `q[0]` is greater than 0. The value of `j` remains 0.
