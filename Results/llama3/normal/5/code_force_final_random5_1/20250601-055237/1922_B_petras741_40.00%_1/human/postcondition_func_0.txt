This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts a positive integer t, followed by t sets of input, each consisting of a positive integer n and a list of n non-negative integers. If n is less than 3, it prints 0. If n is 3 or more, it calculates and prints the number of combinations of 3 elements from the set of n elements, taking into account the frequency of each element. The function processes each set of input independently and prints the result for each set.
