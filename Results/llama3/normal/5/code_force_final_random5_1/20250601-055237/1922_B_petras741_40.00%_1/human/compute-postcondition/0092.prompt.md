Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `rho` is `j+1` where `j` is the index in range `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` and the rest are 0 for all `j` in range `n`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the indices `j` in range `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the number of indices `j` in range `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, `res` is the product of the first three consecutive integers starting from `q[eta[0]]` divided by 6.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 3 integers, rho is j+1 where j is the index in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 and the rest are 0 for all j in range n, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, res is the product of the first three consecutive integers starting from q[eta[0]] divided by 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho. If j is greater than 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, stdin contains `t*n - 3` integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` and the rest are 0 for all `j` in range `n`, `eta` is a list containing all the indices `j` in range `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is at least 3, `res` is the product of the first three consecutive integers starting from `q[eta[0]]` divided by 6 plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is `j+1` where `j` is the index in range `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0 plus `q[eta[j]]`. If `j` is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 3 integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 and the rest are 0 for all j in range n, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3, res is the product of the first three consecutive integers starting from q[eta[0]] divided by 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[j]]), rho is j+1 where j is the index in range n where q[j] is greater than 0 plus q[eta[j]] plus q[eta[j]], j is 2. If j > 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
