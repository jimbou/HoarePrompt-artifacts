Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains `t*n - 3` integers, `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 1, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` and the rest are 0 for all `j` in range `n`, `j` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `j` is equal to `n`, and the list `q` has been updated such that the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` for all `j` in range `n`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
