Output: **the product of the first three consecutive integers starting from q[eta[0]] divided by 6 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range 1 to min(eta_ln, 1001), where q[eta[0]] is the value at index eta[0] in the list q, q[eta[j]] is the value at index eta[j] in the list q for all j in range 1 to min(eta_ln, 1001), eta_ln is at least 3, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, n is an integer, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 and the rest are 0 for all j in range n, w is a list of n integers, rho is j+1 where j is the index in range n where q[j] is greater than 0 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range 1 to min(eta_ln, 1001), j is min(eta_ln, 1001)**
