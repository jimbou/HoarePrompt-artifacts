Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of n integers, stdin contains t*n - 3 integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 and the rest are 0 for all j in range n, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range n where q[j] is greater than 0. If there is exactly one index j in range n where q[j] is greater than 0, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 is printed. Otherwise, res is the product of the first three consecutive integers starting from q[eta[0]] divided by 6 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range 1 to min(eta_ln, 1001), rho is j+1 where j is the index in range n where q[j] is greater than 0 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range 1 to min(eta_ln, 1001), j is min(eta_ln, 1001), and res is printed.**
