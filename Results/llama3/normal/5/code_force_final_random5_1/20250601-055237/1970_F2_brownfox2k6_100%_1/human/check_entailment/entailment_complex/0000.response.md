Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to simulate a game of Quidditch, where two teams, Gryffindor (R) and Ravenclaw (B), compete to score points by throwing the Quaffle into the opponent's goal. The program takes input from the user, including the size of the field, the initial positions of the players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger, and a series of actions performed by the entities on the field.

The program correctly implements the game logic, including the movement of entities, catching and throwing the Quaffle, and scoring points. It also handles the elimination of players who come into contact with the Bludger.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to perform specific tasks. `func_1` updates the coordinates of an entity based on a given direction, while `func_2` checks for collisions between players and the Bludger, eliminates players who are hit, and prints the corresponding output.

The program correctly prints the main events of the game, including scoring points and eliminating players, in the correct order. Finally, it prints the final score of the game.

Overall, the program is well-structured, and the functions are correctly implemented to perform the required tasks. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
