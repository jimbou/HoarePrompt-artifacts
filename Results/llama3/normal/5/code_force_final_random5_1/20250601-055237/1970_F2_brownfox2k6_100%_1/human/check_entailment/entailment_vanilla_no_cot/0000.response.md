Correctness: **False** 

The program is missing the main logic to simulate the game and track the score. It only has two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to moving objects on the field and handling player elimination, respectively. However, there is no code to read the input, initialize the game state, simulate the game steps, or print the final score.

Additionally, the program uses variables like `player`, `blud`, and `t` without defining them anywhere in the provided code. These variables seem to be crucial to the game simulation, but their definitions and initializations are missing.

To fix this, the program needs to be completed with the main game simulation logic, including reading the input, initializing the game state, simulating the game steps, and printing the final score.
