Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is a list containing the first key in the dictionary if the value of the first key in the dictionary is equal to `blud`, otherwise `out` is an empty list, `p` is the first key in the dictionary. The current value of `player[p]` is [-1, -1] if the value of the first key in the dictionary is equal to `blud`, otherwise the value of `player[p]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is a list containing the first key in the dictionary if the value of the first key in the dictionary is equal to `blud`, otherwise `out` is a list containing the second key in the dictionary, `p` is the second key in the dictionary. If `player[p]` is equal to `blud`, then `player[p]` is updated to `[-1, -1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers and must have at least 3 key-value pairs, blud is a list of two integers, out is a list containing the first key in the dictionary if the value of the first key in the dictionary is equal to blud, otherwise out is a list containing the second key in the dictionary. If player[p] is equal to blud, then the value of the third key in the dictionary is updated to [-1, -1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
