Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `player`, and `blud` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `out`, which is an empty list.
