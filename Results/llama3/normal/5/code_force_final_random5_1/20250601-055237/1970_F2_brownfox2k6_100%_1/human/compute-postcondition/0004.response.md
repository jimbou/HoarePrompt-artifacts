Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is a list containing the first key in the dictionary if the value of the first key in the dictionary is equal to `blud`, otherwise `out` is an empty list, `p` is the first key in the dictionary. The current value of `player[p]` is [-1, -1] if the value of the first key in the dictionary is equal to `blud`, otherwise the value of `player[p]` remains unchanged.***
