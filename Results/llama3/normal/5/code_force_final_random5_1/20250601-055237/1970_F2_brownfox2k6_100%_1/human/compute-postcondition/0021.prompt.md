Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is a list containing all keys in the dictionary where the value of the key is equal to `blud`, and for each key in `out`, the value of the key in the dictionary is [-1, -1].
Code of the loop:
for p in sorted(out):
    print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is a non-empty list containing all keys in the dictionary where the value of the key is equal to `blud`, and for each key in `out`, the value of the key in the dictionary is [-1, -1], `p` is the smallest key in `out`, and this is printed: the value of `t` which is a non-negative integer, the value of `p` which is the smallest key in `out` and the string 'ELIMINATED'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is a non-empty list containing all keys in the dictionary where the value of the key is equal to `blud`, and for each key in `out`, the value of the key in the dictionary is [-1, -1], `p` is the next smallest key in `out`, and this is printed: the value of `t`, the value of `p`, and the string 'ELIMINATED'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings of length 2 (first character is either 'R' or 'B' and second character is a digit between 0 and 9) and values are lists of two integers, `blud` is a list of two integers, `out` is a non-empty list containing all keys in the dictionary where the value of the key is equal to `blud`, and for each key in `out`, the value of the key in the dictionary is [-1, -1], `p` is the next smallest key in `out`, and the following is printed: the non-negative integer `t`, the next smallest key `p` in `out`, and the string 'ELIMINATED'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
