Functionality: **This function takes a non-negative integer `t`, a dictionary `player` with specific key-value pairs, and a list `blud` as input. It identifies keys in the `player` dictionary with values matching `blud`, stores these keys in the `out` list, and sets the corresponding values in the `player` dictionary to `[-1, -1]`. Then, it prints the value of `t`, each key in `out` in ascending order, and the string 'ELIMINATED' for each iteration. The function modifies the `player` dictionary and prints the specified output, but does not return any value.**
