Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately simulates the Quidditch game as described in the problem statement. The program correctly handles the movement of players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger, as well as the scoring of goals and the elimination of players. The program also correctly prints the main events of the game, including goals scored and players eliminated, in the correct order.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to handle the movement of entities and the elimination of players, respectively. The `func_1` function correctly updates the coordinates of the entity based on the direction of movement, and the `func_2` function correctly checks for collisions between players and the Bludger, eliminating players as necessary.

The program also correctly handles the scoring of goals, checking if the Quaffle is in a goal and updating the score accordingly. The program also correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

Overall, the program is well-structured and accurately simulates the Quidditch game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
