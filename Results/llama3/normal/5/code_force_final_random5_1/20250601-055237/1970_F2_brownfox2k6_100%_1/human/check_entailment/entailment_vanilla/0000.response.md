Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be a part of a larger program that simulates a game of Quidditch. The two functions provided seem to be responsible for moving objects on the field and handling player elimination.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes an object's position and a direction as input and updates the object's position accordingly. This function seems to be correct, as it properly increments or decrements the object's coordinates based on the direction.

Function 2, `func_2`, takes a time step `t` as input and checks if any players are at the same position as the Bludger. If a player is found, it is eliminated and its position is updated to `[-1, -1]`. The function then prints the elimination event for each eliminated player in alphabetical order.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The `player` and `blud` variables are not defined in the provided code snippet. It is assumed that these variables are defined elsewhere in the program, but without their definitions, it is difficult to determine the correctness of the program.
2. The `func_2` function does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated at the same time. While it does print the elimination events in alphabetical order, it does not account for the possibility that multiple players may be eliminated simultaneously.
3. The program does not seem to handle the scoring of goals. The problem description mentions that a team scores when a player leaves the Quaffle at a goal of the other team, but this is not implemented in the provided code snippet.

Given these issues, it is difficult to determine the correctness of the program without more context or information about the rest of the program.

Correctness: **False**
