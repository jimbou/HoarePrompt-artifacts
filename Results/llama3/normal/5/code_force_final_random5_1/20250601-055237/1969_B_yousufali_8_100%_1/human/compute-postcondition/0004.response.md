Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The only change is that the function `func_1()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are unknown since its implementation is not provided.
