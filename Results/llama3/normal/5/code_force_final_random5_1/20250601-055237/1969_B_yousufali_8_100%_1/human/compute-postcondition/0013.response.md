To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how the variables within it change.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(s)):`. This means we're concerned with the variable `i` and the length of the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The length of `s` is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5. Since `i` is now 2, for the loop to execute again, the length of `s` must be at least 3.

The other variables (`ans` and `n`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a binary string of length at least 3 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, and `n` is either 0 or 1**
