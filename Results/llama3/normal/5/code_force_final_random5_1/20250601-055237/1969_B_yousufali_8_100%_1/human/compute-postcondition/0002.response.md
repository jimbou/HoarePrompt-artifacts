Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0, and a function named `func_1` has been called.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only calls a function named `func_1` without modifying any variables. The function call is executed, but its effects are not specified, so we can only acknowledge that the function has been called. The stdin remains empty, as there is no input operation in the code snippet.
