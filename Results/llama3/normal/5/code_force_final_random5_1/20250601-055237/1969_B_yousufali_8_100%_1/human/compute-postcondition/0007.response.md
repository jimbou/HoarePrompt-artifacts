Output State: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is `t-1`, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1, the variable `_` will be equal to `t-1`, and the function `func_1()` will have been executed `t` times.
