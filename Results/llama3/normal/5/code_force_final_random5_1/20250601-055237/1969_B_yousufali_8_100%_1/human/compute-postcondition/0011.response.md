Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `ans += n + 1`: This line increments the value of `ans` by the value of `n` plus 1.

From the initial state, we know that `n` is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `s[i]`. Specifically, if `s[i]` is '1', then `n` is 1, otherwise `n` is 0.

So, let's consider the two possible cases:

Case 1: `s[i]` is '1', then `n` is 1.

In this case, `ans` is incremented by 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, `ans` becomes 0 + 2 = 2.

Case 2: `s[i]` is not '1', then `n` is 0.

In this case, `ans` is incremented by 0 + 1 = 1. Therefore, `ans` becomes 0 + 1 = 1.

In both cases, the values of `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string of length at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1, `ans` is either 1 or 2, and `n` is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `s[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The binary string `s` remains the same, the index `i` is still 1, and the answer `ans` has been incremented by either 1 or 2, depending on whether the character at index `i` in `s` is '1' or not. The value of `n` is still either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `s[i]`.
