To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `_` is the loop counter, and `t` is the number of iterations.

The current state is:

* `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
* `_` is 0
* A function named `func_1` has been called (this is not relevant to the loop state)

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
* The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

* `t` is still an integer greater than or equal to 1
* `_` is 1 ( incremented by 1 from the previous value of 0)

Note that the state of `func_1` is not relevant to the loop state, as it is not a variable in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1**
