The `print(ans)` statement will print the total number of '1's in the binary string `s` plus the number of '0's in `s` that are preceded by at least one '1'.

Since the exact binary string `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated total count.

Output: **the total number of '1's in the binary string s plus the number of '0's in s that are preceded by at least one '1'**
