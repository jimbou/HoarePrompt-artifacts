Output State: **`s` is a binary string of length at least 3 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, and `n` is either 1 or 2**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables, `s`, `i`, and `ans`, remain unchanged.
