Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is `t-1`, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged (it is still an integer greater than or equal to 1), the variable `_` has been incremented to `t-1` (since it increments by 1 in each iteration), and the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.
