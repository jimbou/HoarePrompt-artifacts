To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. Since `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, it must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `func_1()` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2**
