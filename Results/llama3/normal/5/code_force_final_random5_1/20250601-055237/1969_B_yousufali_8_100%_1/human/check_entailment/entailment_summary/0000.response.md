Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1()` takes a binary string as input and calculates the total number of '1's in the string plus the number of '0's that are preceded by at least one '1'. This is not directly related to the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

However, upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the calculation performed by `func_1()` is actually equivalent to finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. The reason is that the cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring, and the calculation in `func_1()` effectively counts the number of '1's and '0's that need to be shifted to make the string sorted.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer from standard input, executes `func_1()` that many times, and then concludes without returning any value. This is consistent with the problem statement, which requires reading the number of test cases and executing the solution for each test case.

Therefore, based on the execution summaries of the functions, it can be concluded that the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
