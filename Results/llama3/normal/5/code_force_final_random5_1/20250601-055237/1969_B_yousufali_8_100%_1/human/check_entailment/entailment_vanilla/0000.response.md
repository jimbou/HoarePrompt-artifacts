Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string `s` as input and initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of consecutive '1's and `ans` to store the total cost. It then iterates through the string. When it encounters a '1', it increments `n`. When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it increments `ans` by `n + 1`, which represents the cost of shifting the consecutive '1's to the right of the '0'. Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases `t` and calls Function 1 for each test case.

The provided program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost. The key insight is that the cost of shifting a substring is equal to its length, and the program takes advantage of this by only considering the cost of shifting consecutive '1's to the right of a '0'. This is because shifting a substring of '0's does not change the sorted order, and shifting a substring of '1's to the left of a '0' would not be optimal.

The program also handles the edge case where the input string is already sorted (i.e., `n` is always zero), in which case the total cost is zero.

Therefore, the program produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
