Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. The correct operation is to choose the substring "10" and cyclically shift it to get "01", which results in a sorted string "101". The cost of this operation is 2, but the program outputs 2, which is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the number of '1's in the string and adds the length of the substring to the answer whenever it encounters a '0' after a '1'. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to sort the string using cyclic shifts. The program needs to be modified to consider all possible substrings and their cyclic shifts to find the minimum total cost.

For example, a correct implementation could use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to sort the string up to each position. The program could then iterate through the string and consider all possible substrings and their cyclic shifts to update the minimum cost.
