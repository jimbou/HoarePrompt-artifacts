Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string of length at least 3 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `n` is either 0, 1, or 2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', then `n` is either 1 or 2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0' and `n` is not 0, then `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `ans` remains either 0 or 1.***
