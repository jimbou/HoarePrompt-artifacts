The code prints the total number of '1's in `s` plus the number of '0's in `s` that are preceded by at least one '1', which is the value of `ans`.
Output: **`s` is a binary string of length at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is the total number of '1's in `s` plus the number of '0's in `s` that are preceded by at least one '1', and `n` is equal to the number of '1's in the suffix of `s` that ends at the last '1' in `s`, and the total number of '1's in `s` plus the number of '0's in `s` that are preceded by at least one '1' is being printed**
