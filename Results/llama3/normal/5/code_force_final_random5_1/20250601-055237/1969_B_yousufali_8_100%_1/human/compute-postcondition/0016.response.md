Output State: **`s` is a binary string of length at least 3 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 2, 3, 3, or 4, and `n` is either 0 or 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', then `n` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `n` remains either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n + 1` to its previous value. Since `ans` was initially either 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is either 0 or 1, the new value of `ans` can be either 2 (if `ans` was 0 and `n` is 1), 3 (if `ans` was 1 and `n` is 1, or if `ans` was 2 and `n` is 0), or 4 (if `ans` was 2 and `n` is 1). The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
