Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only calls the function `func_1()` without modifying these variables. The function `func_1()` has been executed, but its specific effects on the program state are unknown, as its implementation is not provided.
