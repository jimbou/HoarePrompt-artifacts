State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 27 or 28 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one or two additional characters 'a', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is one more than the current value of a[1] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 1, j is 2**
