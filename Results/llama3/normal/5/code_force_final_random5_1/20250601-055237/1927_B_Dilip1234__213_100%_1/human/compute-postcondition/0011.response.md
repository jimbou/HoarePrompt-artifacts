Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i. If char_count[j] equals a[i], then s is a string of length 1 containing the character 'c', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is 1 plus the initial value of a[0], char_count[1] is 1 plus the initial value of char_count[1], and char_count[2] is 1 plus the initial value of char_count[2], i is 0, j is 2. Otherwise, s remains an empty string, char_count remains unchanged, i is 0, j is 2.***
