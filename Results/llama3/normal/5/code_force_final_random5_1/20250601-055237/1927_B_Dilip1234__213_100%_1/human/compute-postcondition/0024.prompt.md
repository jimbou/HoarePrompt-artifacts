Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, `s` is a string of length 26 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' if char_count[j] equals a[i] for all j, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where char_count[j] is 1 plus the initial value of a[i] for all j, `i` is 1, `j` is 25
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 or 27 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one additional character 'a', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is one more than the current value of a[1] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 1, j is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 27 or 28 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one or two additional characters 'a', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is one more than the current value of a[1] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 1, j is 1. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[1] is one more than its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 27 or 28 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one or two additional characters 'a', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is one more than the current value of a[1] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 1, j is 2. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[2] is one more than its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
