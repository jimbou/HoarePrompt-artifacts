Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 or 27 or 28 or 29 or 30 or 31 or 32 or 33 or 34 or 35 or 36 or 37 or 38 or 39 or 40 or 41 or 42 or 43 or 44 or 45 or 46 or 47 or 48 or 49 or 50 or 51 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelve or thirteen or fourteen or fifteen or sixteen or seventeen or eighteen or nineteen or twenty or twenty-one or twenty-two or twenty-three or twenty-four or twenty-five additional characters 'a', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is one more than the current value of a[1] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 2, j is 25. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[1] is one more than its previous value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[2] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[3] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[4] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[5] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[6] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[7] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[8] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[9] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[10] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[11] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[12] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[13] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[14] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[15] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[16] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[17] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[18] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[19] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[20] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[21] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[22] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[23] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[24] is one more than its original value.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 52 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelve or thirteen or fourteen or fifteen or sixteen or seventeen or eighteen or nineteen or twenty or twenty-one or twenty-two or twenty-three or twenty-four or twenty-five additional characters 'a', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is two more than the current value of a[1] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 2, j is 0. The current value of char_count[j] is equal to the current value of a[i] plus one if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count[j] remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= `a_i` < `n` for all `i`, `s` is a string of length 52 or 53 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelve or thirteen or fourteen or fifteen or sixteen or seventeen or eighteen or nineteen or twenty or twenty-one or twenty-two or twenty-three or twenty-four or twenty-five additional characters 'a', `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[1]` is two or three more than the current value of `a[2]` if `char_count[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `char_count` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. The current value of `char_count[1]` is equal to the current value of `a[2]` plus one or two if `char_count[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `char_count[1]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= `a_i` < `n` for all `i`, `s` is a string of length 52 or 53 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelve or thirteen or fourteen or fifteen or sixteen or seventeen or eighteen or nineteen or twenty or twenty-one or twenty-two or twenty-three or twenty-four or twenty-five additional characters 'a', `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[1]` is two or three more than the current value of `a[2]` if `char_count[1]` equals `a[2]` and `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `char_count` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
