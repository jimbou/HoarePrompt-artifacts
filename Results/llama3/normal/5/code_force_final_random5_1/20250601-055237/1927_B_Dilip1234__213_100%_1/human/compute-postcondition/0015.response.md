Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, `s` is a string of length 26 containing the characters 'a' to 'z', `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where the current value of `char_count[j]` equals the current value of `a[i]` for all j, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `char_count[j]` equals the current value of `a[i]`.**
