State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 26 or 27 or 28 or 29 or 30 or 31 or 32 or 33 or 34 or 35 or 36 or 37 or 38 or 39 or 40 or 41 or 42 or 43 or 44 or 45 or 46 or 47 or 48 or 49 or 50 or 51 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' and possibly one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelve or thirteen or fourteen or fifteen or sixteen or seventeen or eighteen or nineteen or twenty or twenty-one or twenty-two or twenty-three or twenty-four or twenty-five additional characters 'a', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is one more than the current value of a[1] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 2, j is 25. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[1] is one more than its previous value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[2] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[3] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[4] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[5] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[6] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[7] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[8] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[9] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[10] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[11] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[12] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[13] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[14] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[15] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[16] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[17] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[18] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[19] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[20] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[21] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[22] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[23] is one more than its original value. If char_count[j] equals a[i], char_count[24] is one more than its original value.**
