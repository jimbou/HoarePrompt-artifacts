The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j. If j is less than 26, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 1 containing the character 'a' if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise s remains an empty string, char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is 1 plus the initial value of a[0] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 0, j is 1**
