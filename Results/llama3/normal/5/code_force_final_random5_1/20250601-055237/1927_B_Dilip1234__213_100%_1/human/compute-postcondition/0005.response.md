Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 1 containing the character 'a' if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise s remains an empty string, char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is 1 plus the initial value of a[0] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 0, j is 0***
