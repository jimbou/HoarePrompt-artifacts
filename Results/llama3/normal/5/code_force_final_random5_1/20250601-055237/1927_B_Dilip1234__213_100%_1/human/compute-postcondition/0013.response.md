The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, `s` is a string of length 26 containing the characters 'a' to 'z' if char_count[j] equals a[i] for all j, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where char_count[j] is 1 plus the initial value of a[i] for all j, `i` is 1, `j` is 25**
