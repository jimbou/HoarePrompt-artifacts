Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, s is a string of length 1 containing the character 'a' if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise s remains an empty string, char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is 1 plus the initial value of a[0] if char_count[j] equals a[i], otherwise char_count remains unchanged, i is 0, j is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i. If char_count[j] equals a[i], then s is a string of length 2 containing the characters 'a' and 'b', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is 1 plus the initial value of a[0] and char_count[1] is 1 plus the initial value of char_count[1], i is 0, j is 1. Otherwise, s remains an empty string, char_count remains unchanged, i is 0, j is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i. If char_count[j] equals a[i], then s is a string of length 1 containing the character 'c', char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[0] is 1 plus the initial value of a[0], char_count[1] is 1 plus the initial value of char_count[1], and char_count[2] is 1 plus the initial value of char_count[2], i is 0, j is 2. Otherwise, s remains an empty string, char_count remains unchanged, i is 0, j is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
