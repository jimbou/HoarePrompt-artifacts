To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `26`. Since `26` is a constant and cannot be changed, we can only adjust the state of `j`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is less than `26`. Since `j` is initialized to `0` before the loop starts, we can conclude that the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < n for all i, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
