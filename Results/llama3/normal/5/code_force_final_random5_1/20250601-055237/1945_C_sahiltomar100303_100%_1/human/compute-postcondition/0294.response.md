Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, and `right` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, `rightOne` is less than (n + 1) // 2***
