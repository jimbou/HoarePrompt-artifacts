Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0, rightZero and trightZero are incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', rightOne and trightOne are incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', stdin contains 1 input: a string.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 1, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', rightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', trightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', trightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', If the character at index left of string s is '0', rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times minus 1, otherwise, leftOne is decremented by 1 and rightOne is incremented by 1, stdin is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string such that the character at index `left` is not the same as the previous iteration, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is incremented by `(n-mid)` times, `rightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', `trightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', `trightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', if the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decremented by 1, otherwise `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value, stdin is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string such that the character at index `left` is not the same as the previous iteration, `mid` is an integer and greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 3` and greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value and `rightZero` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value. `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented appropriately based on the character at index `i` of string `s`, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented appropriately based on the character at index `i` of string `s`, and `stdin` is empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
