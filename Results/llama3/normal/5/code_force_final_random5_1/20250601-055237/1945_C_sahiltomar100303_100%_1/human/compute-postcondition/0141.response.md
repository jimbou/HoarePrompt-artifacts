Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is mid, leftMove is 0, stdin is empty, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:n].**

The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left` and resets `leftMove` to 0. No other variables are affected. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, `stdin`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
