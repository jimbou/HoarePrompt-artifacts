Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0, stdin is empty, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left] and rightZero must be less than (mid + 1) // 2, trightZero is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:n] and rightOne must be less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, leftOne is decremented by 1, and the character at index left - 1 in string s is not '0'.**
