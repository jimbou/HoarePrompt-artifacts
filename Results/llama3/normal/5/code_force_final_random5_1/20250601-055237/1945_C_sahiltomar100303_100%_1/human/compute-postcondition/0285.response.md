Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `right` is `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `left` remains 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, and `right` is equal to `n`. This means that the loop has iterated over the entire string `s` and has updated the counts of zeros and ones in the left and right halves of the string accordingly.
