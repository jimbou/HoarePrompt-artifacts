Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string where the character at index `mid - 2` is '0', `mid` is an integer and greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 3` and greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 or 2, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 or 2, `leftOne` is decremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '1'. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decremented by 1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 or 2, `leftOne` is decremented by 1, and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `left` has been decremented by 1, making it equal to `mid - 3` and greater than -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
