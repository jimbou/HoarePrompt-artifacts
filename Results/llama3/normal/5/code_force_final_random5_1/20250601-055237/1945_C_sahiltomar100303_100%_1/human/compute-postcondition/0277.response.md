Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, rightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid - 1, leftOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid + 2, rightZero is greater than or equal to half of n - mid, right is mid + 1, mid is less than n, and tleftOne is one more than its original value and trightOne is one less than its original value.**

The code increments `tleftOne` by 1 and decrements `trightOne` by 1. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `right`, and `mid` remain unchanged. The value of `tleftOne` is now one more than its original value, and the value of `trightOne` is one less than its original value.
