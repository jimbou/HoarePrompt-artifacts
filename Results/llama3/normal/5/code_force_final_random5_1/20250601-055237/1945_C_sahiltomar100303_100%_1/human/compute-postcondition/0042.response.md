The code modifies the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, and the second line increments `rightZero` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', and the value of `rightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1'. The values of `trightZero` and `trightOne` are also incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0' or '1', respectively. The rest of the variables, including `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, `left`, and `leftMove`, remain unchanged.
