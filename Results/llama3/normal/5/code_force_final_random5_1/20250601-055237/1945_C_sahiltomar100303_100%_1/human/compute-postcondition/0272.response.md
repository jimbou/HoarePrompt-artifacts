Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, rightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid - 1, leftOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid + 1, rightZero is greater than or equal to half of n - mid, right is mid and mid is less than n. The character at index right in string s is not '0'.**

The code increments `leftOne` by 1 and decrements `rightOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, it becomes less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 1. Similarly, since `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, it becomes less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 1. No other variables are affected.
