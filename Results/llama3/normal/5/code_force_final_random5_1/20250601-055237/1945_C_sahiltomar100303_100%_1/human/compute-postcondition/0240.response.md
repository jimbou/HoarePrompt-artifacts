Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is equal to mid + 1, n is greater than mid + 1, rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer, `s` is still a string, `mid` is still equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is still equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is still less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `trightOne` is still less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is still greater than _, and `i` is still equal to `mid + 1`. The value of `n` is still greater than `mid + 1`.
