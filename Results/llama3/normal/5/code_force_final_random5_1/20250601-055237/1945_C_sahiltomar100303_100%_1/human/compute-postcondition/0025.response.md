Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid + 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string, rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1, rightOne remains unchanged, trightOne remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains greater than 0. The value of n remains an integer and is greater than mid + 1. The value of s remains a string. The value of mid remains an integer and is less than n. The value of i remains equal to mid + 1. Stdin still contains 1 input: a string. The value of rightZero is incremented by 1. The value of trightZero is incremented by 1. The value of rightOne remains unchanged. The value of trightOne remains unchanged.
