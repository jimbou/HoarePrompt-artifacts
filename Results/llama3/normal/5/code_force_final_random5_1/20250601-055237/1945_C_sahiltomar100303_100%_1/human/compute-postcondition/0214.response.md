Postcondition: **right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, and trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid. left is not equal to 0. If right is equal to n, then if left is not equal to 0, the value of left is printed. If left is equal to 0, then if tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of right which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left which is 0 is printed. If right is not equal to n, the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to the middle of n.**
