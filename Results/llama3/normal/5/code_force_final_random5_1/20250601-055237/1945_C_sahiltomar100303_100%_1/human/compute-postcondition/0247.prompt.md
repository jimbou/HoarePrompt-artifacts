Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is equal to mid. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero is equal to mid, tleftZero is equal to mid, and rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0. If the current value of s[i] is '1', then leftOne is equal to mid, tleftOne is equal to mid, leftZero is 0, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, and rightZero is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is equal to mid, n is greater than mid. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are each incremented by 1. If s[i] is not '0', then rightOne is incremented by 1 and trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than _, `i` is equal to `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than `mid + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is greater than its original value and `trightOne` is greater than its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than _, `i` is equal to `mid + 2`, `n` is greater than `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
