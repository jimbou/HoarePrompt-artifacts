Output State: **right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, and trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the right pointer has reached the end of the string (right is equal to n), and the number of zeros in the left half (tleftZero) and the number of ones in the right half (trightOne) are both less than or equal to half of the total length of the string (n). This indicates that the loop has successfully partitioned the string into two halves with balanced zeros and ones.
