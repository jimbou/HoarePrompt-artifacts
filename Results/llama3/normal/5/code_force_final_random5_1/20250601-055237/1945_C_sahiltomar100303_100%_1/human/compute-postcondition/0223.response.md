Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2 and must be at least 1, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'.***
