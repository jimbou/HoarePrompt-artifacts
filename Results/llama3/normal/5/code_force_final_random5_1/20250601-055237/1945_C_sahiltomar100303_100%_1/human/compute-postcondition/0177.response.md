Output State: **left is 0, mid is less than n - 3, right is mid + 3. If s[right] is '0', then tleftZero is less than half of mid + 3 plus one, and trightOne's original value is less than half of n - mid - 3. Otherwise, tleftZero is less than half of mid + 3, tleftOne is tleftOne's original value plus 1, and trightOne is trightOne's original value minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of right has been incremented by 1, so it is now mid + 3. The other variables are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same. The conditions on tleftZero, tleftOne, and trightOne still depend on the value of s[right], which is now s[mid + 3].
