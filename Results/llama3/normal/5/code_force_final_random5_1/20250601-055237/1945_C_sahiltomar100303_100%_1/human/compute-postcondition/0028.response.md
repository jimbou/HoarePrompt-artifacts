State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mid + 2`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1.**
