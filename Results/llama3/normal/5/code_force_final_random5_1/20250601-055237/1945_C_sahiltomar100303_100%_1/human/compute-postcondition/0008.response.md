Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. Otherwise, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0.***
