Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid - 1`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', then `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `left` being equal to `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are still dependent on the character at index `left - 1` in string `s`.
