Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid minus 1, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is not '0', then tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value.***
