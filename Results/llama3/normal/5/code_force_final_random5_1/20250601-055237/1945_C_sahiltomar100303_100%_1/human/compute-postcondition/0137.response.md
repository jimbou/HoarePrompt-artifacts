Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to mid + 2, leftMove is 0, rightZero is 1, trightZero is 1, stdin is empty, n is greater than or equal to mid + 2**

The code snippet increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` and `trightZero` were not defined in the initial state, we assume they were initialized to 0 before the code execution. After the code runs, `rightZero` and `trightZero` become 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
