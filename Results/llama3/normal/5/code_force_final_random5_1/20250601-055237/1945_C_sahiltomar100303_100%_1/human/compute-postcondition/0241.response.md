Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid + 1, t is greater than _, i is equal to mid + 1, n is greater than mid + 1, rightOne is greater than its original value, trightOne is greater than its original value**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, `i`, and the relationship between `n` and `mid` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are in the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne`, which have both been incremented by 1.
