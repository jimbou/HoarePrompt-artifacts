Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `stdin` is empty. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `left` is not equal to 0, the current value of `left` is being printed. Otherwise, if the current value of `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `left` which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is being printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then the value of `right` is being printed if `left` is 0. Otherwise, the value of `left` or `right` is printed, depending on whether the absolute difference between the middle index `((n + 1) // 2)` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index `((n + 1) // 2)` and `right`.***
