Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is less than `n` - 2, `right` is `mid` + 3. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid` + 1, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 2, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 2, and `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 1. If `s[right - 1]` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is one more than its original value and less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1. The conditions related to `s[right]` are now related to `s[right - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
