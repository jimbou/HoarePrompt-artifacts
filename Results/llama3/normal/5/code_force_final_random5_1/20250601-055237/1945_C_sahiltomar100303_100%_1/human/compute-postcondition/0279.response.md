Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 1, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 2, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `right` is `mid` + 2, `mid` is less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `rightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `rightOne` is one less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `right` being `mid` + 2. All other variables remain unchanged, with their relationships and constraints still holding true.
