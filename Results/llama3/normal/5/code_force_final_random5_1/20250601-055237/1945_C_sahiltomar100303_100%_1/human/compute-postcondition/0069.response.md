Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions for another iteration, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `left` is equal to 1, `right` is less than `n` and has been incremented by 1 but still in a position to satisfy the loop conditions, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `trightZero` is decremented by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` remains unchanged, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is still an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions for another iteration, `s` is still a string, `mid` is still an integer and greater than 0, `i` is still equal to `n`, and `stdin` is still empty. The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and its new value is still less than `n` and in a position to satisfy the loop conditions. If the character at the new `right` index in string `s` is '0', then `left` is 0, `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, and `trightZero` has been decremented by 1. Otherwise, `left` is 1, and `tleftZero` and `trightZero` remain unchanged.
