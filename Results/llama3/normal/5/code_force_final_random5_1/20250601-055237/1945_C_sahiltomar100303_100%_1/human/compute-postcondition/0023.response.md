Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than mid, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.***
