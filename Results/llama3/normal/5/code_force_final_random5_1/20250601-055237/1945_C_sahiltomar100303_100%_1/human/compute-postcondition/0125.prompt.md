Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, stdin is empty. If right is equal to n, then if left is not equal to 0, the current value of left is being printed. Otherwise, if the current value of rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of left which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is equal to n is being printed. If right is not equal to n, then the value of right is being printed if left is 0. Otherwise, the value of left or right is printed, depending on whether the absolute difference between the middle index ((n + 1) // 2) and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index ((n + 1) // 2) and right.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is 0, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, stdin is empty. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, leftOne and tleftOne are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 1, i is 1, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, stdin is empty. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, leftOne and tleftOne are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 2, i is 2, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, stdin is empty. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, leftOne and tleftOne are incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
