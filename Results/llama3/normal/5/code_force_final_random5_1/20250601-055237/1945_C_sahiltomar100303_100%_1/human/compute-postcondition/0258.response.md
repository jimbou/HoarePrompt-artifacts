Output State: **n is greater than 0, s is a string, mid is an integer greater than 1 and equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 1 and greater than 0, leftMove is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to mid // 2 - 1, leftOne is less than or equal to (mid - 2) // 2 - 1, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid + 3) // 2 - 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `leftOne` and `rightOne`. The first line decrements `leftOne` by 1, and the second line increments `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The final state reflects these modifications, updating the ranges for `leftOne` and `rightOne` accordingly.
