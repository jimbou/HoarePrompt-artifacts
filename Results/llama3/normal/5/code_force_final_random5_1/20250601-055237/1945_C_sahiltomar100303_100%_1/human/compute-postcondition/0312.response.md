Postcondition: ***`left` is not equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`. The current value of `right` is equal to `n`. If `left` is not equal to 0, the value of `left` is printed. If `left` is equal to 0, and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed.***
