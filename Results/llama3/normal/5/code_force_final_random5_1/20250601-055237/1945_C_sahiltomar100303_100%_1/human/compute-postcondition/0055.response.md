Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to 0, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left] plus 1, rightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '1's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than (mid + 1) // 2 minus 1, trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, right is equal to mid, stdin is empty. The current value of s[right] is '0'**

In this output state, the value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1, and the value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
