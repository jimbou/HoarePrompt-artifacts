Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 2` and greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2 - 2`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 2) // 2 - 1`, and `rightZero` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2 - 1`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to `(mid - 2) // 2 - 1`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 3) // 2 - 1.**
