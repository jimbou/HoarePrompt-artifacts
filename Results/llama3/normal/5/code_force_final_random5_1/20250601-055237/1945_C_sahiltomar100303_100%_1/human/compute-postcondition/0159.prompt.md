Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is mid, leftMove is 0, stdin is empty, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:n].
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is decremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '1'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string where the character at index `mid - 2` is '0', `mid` is an integer and greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 2` and greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 or 2, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 or 2, `leftOne` is decremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '1'.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string where the character at index `mid - 2` is '0', `mid` is an integer and greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 3` and greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 or 2, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 or 2, `leftOne` is decremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '1'. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decremented by 1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 or 2, `leftOne` is decremented by 1, and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
