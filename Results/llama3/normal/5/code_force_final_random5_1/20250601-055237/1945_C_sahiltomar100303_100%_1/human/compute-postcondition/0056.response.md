Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `rightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `right` is equal to `mid`, stdin is empty, and the character at the `right` index of string `s` is not '0'***
