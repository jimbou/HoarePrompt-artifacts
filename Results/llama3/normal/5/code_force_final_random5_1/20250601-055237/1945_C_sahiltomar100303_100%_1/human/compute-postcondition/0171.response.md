Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `mid` is less than `n`, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `right + 1`, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right + 1`. If `s[right]` is '0', then the values of `left`, `mid`, `right`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is less than half of `right + 1` and is 1 more than its original value, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right + 1` and is 1 less than its original value.***
