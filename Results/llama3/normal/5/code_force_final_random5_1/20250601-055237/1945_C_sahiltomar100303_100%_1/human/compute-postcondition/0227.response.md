Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2 and must be at least 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than _, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2, and `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2, `tleftOne` is 2, `leftZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, and `rightZero` is 0.**
