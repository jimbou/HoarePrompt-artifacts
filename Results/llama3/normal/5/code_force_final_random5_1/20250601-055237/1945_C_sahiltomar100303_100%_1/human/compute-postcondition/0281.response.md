Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid + 1, rightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid - 2, leftOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid + 2, rightZero is greater than or equal to half of n - mid - 1, right is mid + 2, mid is less than n - 2**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, `mid`, `rightOne`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged. The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `rightZero` is decremented by 1. The relationships between these variables are maintained, with `leftZero` still being less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, and `rightZero` still being greater than or equal to half of `n` minus `mid`.
