To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0**
