Output State: **n is greater than 0, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid minus 1, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0. The current value of s[left - 1] is '0'.**

The code modifies the values of `tleftZero` and `trightOne`. The first line decrements `tleftZero` by 1, making it less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid` minus 1. The second line increments `trightOne` by 1, but since its value is not explicitly provided, we can only confirm that it remains less than or equal to half of `n` minus `mid`. No other variables are affected by the code.
