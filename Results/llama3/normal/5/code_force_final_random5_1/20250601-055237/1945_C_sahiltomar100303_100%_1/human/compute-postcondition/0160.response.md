Output State: **left is equal to 0, leftZero is decremented by the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], leftOne is decremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], rightZero is incremented by the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:mid], mid is assigned to right.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of left remains 0. The values of leftZero and leftOne are decremented by the number of '0's and '1's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left] respectively. The values of rightZero and rightOne are incremented by the number of '0's and '1's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left] respectively. The value of right is now equal to mid.
