Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `rightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', `trightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', `right` is equal to `mid`, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, stdin is empty. If the character at the right index of string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]` plus 1, `trightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` minus 1, and `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` minus 1, and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0, `right` is less than `n` and has been incremented by 1, stdin is empty. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftMove` is set to 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions for another iteration, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `left` is equal to 1, `right` is less than `n` and has been incremented by 1 but still in a position to satisfy the loop conditions, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `trightZero` is decremented by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` remains unchanged, `stdin` is empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
