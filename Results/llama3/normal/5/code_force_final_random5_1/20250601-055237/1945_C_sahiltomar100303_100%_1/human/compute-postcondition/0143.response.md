Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]` and `rightZero` must be less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. The current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.***
