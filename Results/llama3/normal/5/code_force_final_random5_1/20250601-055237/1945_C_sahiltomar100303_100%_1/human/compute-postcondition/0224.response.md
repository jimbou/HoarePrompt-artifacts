The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and mid, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `mid` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `mid` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2 and must be at least 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'.**
