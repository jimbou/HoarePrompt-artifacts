This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It then finds the index that splits the string into two parts with the most balanced distribution of 0s and 1s. If there are multiple such indices, it prints the one closest to the middle of the string. The function prints the index for each test case.
