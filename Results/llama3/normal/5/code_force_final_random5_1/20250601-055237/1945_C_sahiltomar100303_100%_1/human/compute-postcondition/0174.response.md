Output State: **left is 0, mid is less than n - 2, right is mid + 2, tleftZero is less than half of mid + 2 plus one, and trightOne's original value is less than half of n - mid - 2**

The code snippet increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was less than half of `mid + 2`, it is now less than half of `mid + 2` plus one. The value of `trightOne` is not affected by the code, so it remains less than half of `n - mid - 2`. The values of `left`, `mid`, and `right` are not modified by the code, so they retain their original values.
