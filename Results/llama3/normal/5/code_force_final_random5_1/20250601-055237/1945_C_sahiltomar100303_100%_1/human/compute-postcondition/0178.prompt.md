Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left is equal to 0, leftZero is decremented by the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], leftOne is decremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], rightZero is incremented by the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:mid], mid is assigned to right.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 0, `mid` is less than `n`, `mid` is assigned to `right`, `right` is incremented by 1, `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - mid`. If `s[right]` is '0', `leftZero` is decremented by the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]` plus 1, `leftOne` is decremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]` minus 1, and `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:mid]`. If `s[right]` is not '0', `leftZero` is decremented by the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `leftOne` is decremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]` and then incremented by 1, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, and `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:mid]` and then decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 0, `mid` is less than `n`, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid + 2`, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - mid - 1`. If `s[mid + 1]` is '0', then the values of `left`, `mid`, `right`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If `s[mid + 1]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is less than half of `mid + 2` and is 1 more than its original value, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - mid - 1` and is 1 less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: left is 0, mid is less than n - 3, right is mid + 3. If s[right] is '0', then tleftZero is less than half of mid + 3 plus one, and trightOne's original value is less than half of n - mid - 3. Otherwise, tleftZero is less than half of mid + 3, tleftOne is tleftOne's original value plus 1, and trightOne is trightOne's original value minus 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
