Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is equal to mid, n is greater than mid. The current value of s[i] is '0', rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1.**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1, while leaving all other variables unchanged. The value of `s[i]` remains '0', and the relationships between the other variables remain the same.
