Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2 and must be at least 1, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, t is greater than _, i is 0, and s[i] is not equal to '0'**

The code increments `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 0, it becomes 1. Similarly, `tleftOne` was initially 0, so it also becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
