Postcondition: ***n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2 and must be at least 3, right is equal to n, i is 2. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero is 3, tleftZero is 3, and rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0. If the current value of s[i] is '1', then leftOne is 3, tleftOne is 3, leftZero is 0, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, and rightZero is 0. In both cases, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus 3, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, and t is greater than _.***
