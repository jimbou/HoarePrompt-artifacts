Output: **`left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`. The current value of `right` is equal to `n`. `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2, and the value of `left` which is 0 is being printed**
