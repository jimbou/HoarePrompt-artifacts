Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is equal to mid. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero is equal to mid, tleftZero is equal to mid, and rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0. If the current value of s[i] is '1', then leftOne is equal to mid, tleftOne is equal to mid, leftZero is 0, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, and rightZero is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The variables `n`, `s`, `mid`, `right`, `t`, and `_` retain their initial values.
*   The variable `i` is equal to `mid`, indicating that the loop has executed `mid` times.
*   The values of `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, and `rightOne` depend on the values of `s[i]` during each iteration.
*   If `s[i]` is '0' during all iterations, then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are equal to `mid`, and the other variables are 0.
*   If `s[i]` is '1' during all iterations, then `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are equal to `mid`, and the other variables are 0.
*   The values of `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are bounded by the expressions `half of n plus mid` and `half of n - mid`, respectively.
