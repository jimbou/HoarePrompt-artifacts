Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `stdin` is empty. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `left` is not equal to 0, the current value of `left` is being printed. Otherwise, if the current value of `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `left` which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is being printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then the value of `right` is being printed if `left` is 0. Otherwise, the value of `left` or `right` is printed, depending on whether the absolute difference between the middle index `((n + 1) // 2)` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index `((n + 1) // 2)` and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, and trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid. If left is equal to 0, then if trightOne is greater than or equal to half of n plus one divided by two, the value of left is printed; otherwise, the value of right is printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right is equal to n, the value of left is printed; otherwise, the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to the middle of n.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` is either 0 or not 0. If `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is being printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1 divided by 2, the value of `left` which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, and the value of `right` is being printed. If `left` is not 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`. If `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `left` is printed if it is not equal to 0. If `left` is equal to 0, and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of either `left` or `right` is printed, whichever is closer to or equally distant from the middle of `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
