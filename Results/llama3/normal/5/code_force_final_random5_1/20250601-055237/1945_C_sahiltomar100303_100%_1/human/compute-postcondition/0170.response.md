Output State: **left is 0, mid is less than n, mid is assigned to right, right is incremented by 1, tleftZero is less than half of right + 1, tleftOne is less than half of right + 1 and is 1 more than its original value, and trightOne is less than half of n - right + 1 and is 1 less than its original value.**

The first line increments `tleftOne` by 1, making it 1 more than its original value. The second line decrements `trightOne` by 1, making it 1 less than its original value. No other variables are affected.
