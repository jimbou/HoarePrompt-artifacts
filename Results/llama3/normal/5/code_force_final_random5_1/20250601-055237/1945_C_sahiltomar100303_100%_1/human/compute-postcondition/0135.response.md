Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to mid + 1, leftMove is 0, stdin is empty, n is greater than or equal to mid + 1. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left] plus 1, and trightZero is incremented by 1. If s[i] is not '0', then trightOne is incremented by 1, and rightOne is incremented by 1.***
