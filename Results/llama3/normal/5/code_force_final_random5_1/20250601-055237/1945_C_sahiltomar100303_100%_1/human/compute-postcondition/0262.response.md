Output State: **n is greater than 0, s is a string, mid is an integer greater than 1 and equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 2 and greater than 0, leftMove is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to mid // 2 - 2 or mid // 2 - 1, rightZero is greater than or equal to 1 or 2, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid + 2) // 2 - 1 or (n - mid + 3) // 2 - 1, leftOne is less than or equal to (mid - 2) // 2 - 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, and the second line increments `rightZero` by 1. The values of `leftZero` and `rightZero` are updated based on their previous values, which were constrained by the initial state conditions. The other variables remain unchanged.
