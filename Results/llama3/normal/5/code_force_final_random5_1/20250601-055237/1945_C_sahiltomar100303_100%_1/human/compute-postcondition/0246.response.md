Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than _, `i` is equal to `mid + 2`, `n` is greater than `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is incremented by 1.**
