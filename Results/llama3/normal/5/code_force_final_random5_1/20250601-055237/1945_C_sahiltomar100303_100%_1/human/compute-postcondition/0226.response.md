Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2 and must be at least 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is 1, leftOne is 2, tleftOne is 2, leftZero is 0, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, and rightZero is 0.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1, resulting in `leftOne` being 2 and `tleftOne` being 2. The values of `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `rightZero` remain unchanged from the initial state, with `leftZero` being 0, `rightOne` being 0, `trightZero` being 0, and `rightZero` being 0.
