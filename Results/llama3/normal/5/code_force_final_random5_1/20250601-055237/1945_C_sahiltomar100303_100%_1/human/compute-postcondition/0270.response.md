Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, rightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, leftOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, rightZero is greater than or equal to half of n - mid, right is mid, mid is less than n, tleftZero is one more than its original value, and trightZero is one less than its original value.**

The code increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1. The initial values of `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are not specified, but their changes are reflected in the output state. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
