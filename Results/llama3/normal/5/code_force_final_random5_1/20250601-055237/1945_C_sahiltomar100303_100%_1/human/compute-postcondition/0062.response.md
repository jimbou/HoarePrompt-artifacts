Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to 0, leftMove is 1, right is less than n, trightOne is less than (n - right + 1) // 2 - 1**

In this final state, all variables retain their initial values except for `tleftOne` and `trightOne`. The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, making it `leftMove` equal to 1. The value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1, making it less than `(n - right + 1) // 2 - 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
