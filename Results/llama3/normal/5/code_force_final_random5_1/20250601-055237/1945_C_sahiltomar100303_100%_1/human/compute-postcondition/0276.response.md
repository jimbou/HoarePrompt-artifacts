Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is one more than its original value, rightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid + 1, rightZero is one less than its original value, right is mid + 1 and mid is less than n.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, `mid`, `rightOne`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `rightZero` is decremented by 1. The character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0'.
