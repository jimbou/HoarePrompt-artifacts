Postcondition: ***`left` is not equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`. If `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `left` is printed if it is not equal to 0. If `left` is equal to 0, and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of either `left` or `right` is printed, whichever is closer to or equally distant from the middle of `n`.***
