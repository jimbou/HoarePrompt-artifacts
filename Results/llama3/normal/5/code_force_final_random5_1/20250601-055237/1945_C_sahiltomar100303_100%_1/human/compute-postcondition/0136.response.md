The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `mid + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `mid + 2`, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 2`.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `mid + 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `n` is greater than or equal to `mid + 2**
