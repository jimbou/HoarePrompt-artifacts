Output State: **`left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `right` is equal to `mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationships between the variables, such as `leftZero` being less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, and `rightZero` being greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, are still valid.
