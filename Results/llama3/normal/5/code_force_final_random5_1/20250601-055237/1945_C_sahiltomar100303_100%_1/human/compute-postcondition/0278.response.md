Postcondition: ***left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, rightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid - 1, leftOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid + 2, rightZero is greater than or equal to half of n - mid, right is mid + 1, mid is less than n. If s[right] is '0', then leftZero is one more than its original value and rightZero is one less than its original value. Otherwise, leftOne is one more than its original value and rightOne is one less than its original value.***
