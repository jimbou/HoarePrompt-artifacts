Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `trightZero` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is decremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is decremented by 1 if the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` is decremented by 1. If the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decremented by 1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `mid - 1` in string `s` is '1', then `leftOne` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
