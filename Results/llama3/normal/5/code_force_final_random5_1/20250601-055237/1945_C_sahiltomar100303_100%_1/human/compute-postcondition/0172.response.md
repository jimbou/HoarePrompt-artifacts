Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is less than `n`, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `mid + 2`, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - mid - 1`. If `s[mid + 1]` is '0', then the values of `left`, `mid`, `right`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If `s[mid + 1]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is less than half of `mid + 2` and is 1 more than its original value, and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - mid - 1` and is 1 less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and the conditions related to `s[right]` have been updated accordingly. The values of `left`, `mid`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, but their relationships with `right` have been updated. The conditions related to `s[mid + 1]` have been added to reflect the new value of `right`.
