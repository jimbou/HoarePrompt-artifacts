Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to mid + 2, leftMove is 0, stdin is empty, n is greater than or equal to mid + 2. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero is 1 and trightZero is 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are each increased by 1.***
