Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions for another iteration, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` is empty. If `s[right]` is '0', then `left` is equal to 0, `right` is less than `n` and has been incremented by 1 but still in a position to satisfy the loop conditions, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `left` is equal to 1, `right` is less than `n` and has been decremented by 1 but still in a position to satisfy the loop conditions.***
