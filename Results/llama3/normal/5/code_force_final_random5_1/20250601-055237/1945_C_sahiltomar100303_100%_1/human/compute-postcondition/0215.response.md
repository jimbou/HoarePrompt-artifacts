Postcondition: **right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, and trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid. If left is equal to 0, then if trightOne is greater than or equal to half of n plus one divided by two, the value of left is printed; otherwise, the value of right is printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right is equal to n, the value of left is printed; otherwise, the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to the middle of n.**
