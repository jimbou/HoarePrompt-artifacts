Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string where the character at index mid - 2 is '0', mid is an integer and greater than 1, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 2 and greater than 0, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by 1 or 2, trightZero is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:n] and rightOne must be less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, leftZero is decremented by 1 or 2, leftOne is decremented by 1 if the character at index mid - 1 in string s is '1', leftOne is decremented by 1, rightOne is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still valid, and the values of leftOne and rightOne have been updated according to the code. The value of leftOne is decremented by 1, and the value of rightOne is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
