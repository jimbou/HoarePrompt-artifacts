Postcondition: ***n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is equal to mid, n is greater than mid. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are each incremented by 1. If s[i] is not '0', then rightOne is incremented by 1 and trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid + 1.***
