Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, _ is equal to t, t is greater than t
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2 and must be at least 1, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2 and must be at least 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than _, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2, and `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2, `tleftOne` is 2, `leftZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, and `rightZero` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2 and must be at least 3, right is equal to n, i is 2. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero is 3, tleftZero is 3, and rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0. If the current value of s[i] is '1', then leftOne is 3, tleftOne is 3, leftZero is 0, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, and rightZero is 0. In both cases, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus 3, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, and t is greater than _.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
