Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0, `right` is less than `n` and has been incremented by 1, stdin is empty. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftMove` is set to 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `s[right]` are still valid, but now they are applied to the new value of `right`.
