Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string such that the character at index left is not the same as the previous iteration, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 1, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise it is incremented by (n-mid) times, rightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', trightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', trightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', if the character at index left - 1 of string s is '0', then leftZero is decremented by 1, otherwise leftOne is one less than its original value and rightOne is one more than its original value, stdin is empty.***
