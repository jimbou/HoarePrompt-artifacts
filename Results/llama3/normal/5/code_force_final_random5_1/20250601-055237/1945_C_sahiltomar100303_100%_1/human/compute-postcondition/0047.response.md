Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 2, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 2 and greater than 0, leftMove is 0, leftZero is one less than its original value, rightZero is one more than its original value, rightOne and trightOne are incremented appropriately based on the character at index i of string s, trightZero is incremented appropriately based on the character at index i of string s, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, and the second line increments `rightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with the updated values of `leftZero` and `rightZero`.
