Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string such that the character at index left is not the same as the previous iteration, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 1, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', rightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', trightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', trightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', leftOne is one less than its original value, rightOne is one more than its original value, stdin is empty**

The code modifies the values of `leftOne` and `rightOne`. The first line decrements `leftOne` by 1, and the second line increments `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
