Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2 and must be at least 1, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, _ is equal to t, t is greater than t, i is 0. The current value of s[i] is '0'.**

The code increments the value of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. The initial value of `leftZero` was 0, so it becomes 1. Similarly, the initial value of `tleftZero` was 0, so it also becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
