Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is decremented by the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], leftOne is decremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left] and then incremented by 1, rightZero is incremented by the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:mid] and then decremented by 1, mid is assigned to right, mid is less than n, tleftZero is less than half of mid + 1, trightOne is less than half of n - mid + 1, and s[right] is not equal to '0'.**
