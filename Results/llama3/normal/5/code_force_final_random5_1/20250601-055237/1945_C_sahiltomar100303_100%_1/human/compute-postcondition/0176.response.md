Postcondition: ***left is 0, mid is less than n - 2, right is mid + 2. If s[right] is '0', then tleftZero is less than half of mid + 2 plus one, and trightOne's original value is less than half of n - mid - 2. Otherwise, tleftZero is less than half of mid + 2, tleftOne is tleftOne's original value plus 1, and trightOne is trightOne's original value minus 1.***
