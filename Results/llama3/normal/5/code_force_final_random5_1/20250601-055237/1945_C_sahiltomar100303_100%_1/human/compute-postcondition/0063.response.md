Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0, `right` is less than `n`, stdin is empty. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftMove` is set to 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.***
