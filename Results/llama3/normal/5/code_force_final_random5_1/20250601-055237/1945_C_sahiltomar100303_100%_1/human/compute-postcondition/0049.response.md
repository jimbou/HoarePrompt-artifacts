Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string such that the character at index `left` is not the same as the previous iteration, `mid` is an integer and greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 2` and greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value and `rightZero` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value. `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented appropriately based on the character at index `i` of string `s`, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented appropriately based on the character at index `i` of string `s`, and `stdin` is empty.**
