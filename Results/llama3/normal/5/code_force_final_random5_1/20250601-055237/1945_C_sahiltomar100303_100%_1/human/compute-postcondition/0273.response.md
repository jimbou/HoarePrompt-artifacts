Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `right` is `mid` and `mid` is less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 1, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 1, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0'.***
