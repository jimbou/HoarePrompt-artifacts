Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', rightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', trightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', trightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', stdin is empty. If the character at index left - 1 of string s is '0', rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times minus 1, otherwise, leftOne is decremented by 1 and rightOne is incremented by 1.**
