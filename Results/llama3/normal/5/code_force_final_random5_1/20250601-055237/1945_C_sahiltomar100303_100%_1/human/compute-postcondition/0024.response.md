To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mid`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mid`, and `mid` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The new state of `i` is `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is less than `n`, `mid + 1` is also less than `n`, so the loop can execute again.

The state of `mid` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of `t`, `s`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

The state of `stdin` is not modified in the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than `mid + 1`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mid + 1`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1.**
