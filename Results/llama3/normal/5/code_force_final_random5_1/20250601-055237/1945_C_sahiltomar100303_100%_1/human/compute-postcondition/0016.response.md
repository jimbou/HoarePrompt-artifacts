Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 3, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 3, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is '1', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 3, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 3, trightOne is 0.**
