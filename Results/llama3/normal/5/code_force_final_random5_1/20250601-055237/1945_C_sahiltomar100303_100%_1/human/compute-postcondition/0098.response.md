Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is not equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is equal to `n`, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `right` is equal to `n`. If `left` is not equal to 0, the current value of `left` is being printed. If `left` is equal to 0, if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `left` which is 0 is being printed.***
