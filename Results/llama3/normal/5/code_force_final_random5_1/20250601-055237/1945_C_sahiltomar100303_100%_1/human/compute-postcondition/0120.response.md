Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 1, i is 1, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, stdin is empty. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, leftOne and tleftOne are incremented by 1.**
