The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `t-1` (since `_` starts from 0 and goes up to `t-1`). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be equal to `t` and `t` must be greater than `t` (which means `t` must be at least `t+1`).
State: **right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, _ is equal to t, t is greater than t**
