Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 2, i is 2, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, stdin is empty, leftOne is incremented by 1, tleftOne is incremented by 1.**

The code increments leftOne and tleftOne by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
