Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is being printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1 divided by 2, the value of `left` which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, and the value of `right` is being printed.***
