Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string such that the character at index `left` is not the same as the previous iteration, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is incremented by `(n-mid)` times, `rightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', `trightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', `trightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', if the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decremented by 1, otherwise `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, resulting in `left` being equal to `mid - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, `leftMove`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne` are still valid. The stdin remains empty.
