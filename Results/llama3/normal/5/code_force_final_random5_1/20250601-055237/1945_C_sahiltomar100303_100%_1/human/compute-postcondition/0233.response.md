To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `mid`, because the range starts from `mid` and goes up to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `t` is greater than _, `i` is equal to `mid`, `n` must be greater than `mid`**
