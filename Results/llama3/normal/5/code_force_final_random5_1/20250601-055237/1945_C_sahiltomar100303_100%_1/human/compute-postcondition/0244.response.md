Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is equal to mid + 2, n is greater than mid + 2, rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1.**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
