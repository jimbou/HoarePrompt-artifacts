Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times minus 1, trightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times, rightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times, trightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times, stdin contains 1 input: a string. The current value of s[left - 1] is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `leftZero` has been decremented by 1, while the value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s[left - 1]` is still '0'.
