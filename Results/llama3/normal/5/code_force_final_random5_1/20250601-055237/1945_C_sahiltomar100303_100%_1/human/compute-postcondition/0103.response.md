Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is not equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is not equal to `n`, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `stdin` is empty. The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`***
