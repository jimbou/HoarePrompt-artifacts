Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is 0, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times plus the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], trightZero is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, stdin is empty, leftZero is incremented by 1, tleftZero is incremented by 1.**

The code increments `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. Since `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are incremented to account for this '0'. No other variables are affected.
