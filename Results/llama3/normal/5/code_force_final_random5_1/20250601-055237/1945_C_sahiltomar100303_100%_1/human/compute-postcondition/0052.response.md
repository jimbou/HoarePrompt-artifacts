Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `rightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', `trightOne` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', `right` is equal to `mid`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, `left`, `leftMove`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` are still valid.
