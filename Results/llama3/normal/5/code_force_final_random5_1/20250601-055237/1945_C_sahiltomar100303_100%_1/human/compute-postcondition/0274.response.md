Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 1, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 1, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `right` is `mid` + 1 and `mid` is less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, and `rightZero` are updated based on the new value of `right`. If the character at the new `right` index in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, the character at the new `right` index is not '0'. The values of `left` and `mid` remain unchanged.
