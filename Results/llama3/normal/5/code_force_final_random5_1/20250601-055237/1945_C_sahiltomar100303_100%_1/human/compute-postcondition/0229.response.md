Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2 and must be at least 3, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus 3, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is 2. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero is 3, tleftZero is 3, and rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0. Otherwise, leftOne is 2, tleftOne is 2, leftZero is 1, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, and rightZero is 0.**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` becomes 3 and `tleftZero` becomes 3. Otherwise, `leftZero` becomes 1 and `tleftZero` remains 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
