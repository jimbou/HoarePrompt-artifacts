Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string where the character at index mid - 1 is '0', mid is an integer and greater than 1, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 1 and greater than 0, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by 2, trightZero is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, trightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2, rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:n] and rightOne must be less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, leftZero is decremented by 2, leftOne is decremented by 1 if the character at index mid - 1 in string s is '1'.**
