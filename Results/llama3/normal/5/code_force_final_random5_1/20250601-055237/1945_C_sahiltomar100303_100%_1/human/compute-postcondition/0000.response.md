Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case, as one test case has been consumed to assign the value to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain two inputs each: an integer and a string of 0s and 1s, as specified in the initial state.
