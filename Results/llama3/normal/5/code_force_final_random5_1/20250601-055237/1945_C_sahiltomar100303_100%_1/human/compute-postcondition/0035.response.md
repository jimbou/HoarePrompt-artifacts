Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', `stdin` contains 1 input: a string. The current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**
