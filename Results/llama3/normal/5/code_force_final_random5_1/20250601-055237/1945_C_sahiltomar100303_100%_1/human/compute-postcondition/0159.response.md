Output State: **left is equal to 0, leftZero is decremented by the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], leftOne is decremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], rightZero is incremented by the number of '0's in the substring s[mid-1:mid-1+left], rightOne is incremented by the number of '1's in the substring s[mid:n].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `left` is equal to 0, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`. The variables `leftZero` and `leftOne` are decremented by the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, respectively, while the variables `rightZero` and `rightOne` are incremented by the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
