Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, right is equal to n, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of n plus mid, trightOne is less than or equal to half of n - mid, t is greater than _, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are each incremented by the number of times '0' appears in s from index mid to n-1. If s[i] is not '0', then rightOne and trightOne are each incremented by the number of times '1' appears in s from index mid to n-1.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid - 1`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is not '0', then `tleftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 2` and greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2 - 2` and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 2) // 2 - 1` and `rightZero` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2 - 1`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to `(mid - 2) // 2 - 1` and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 3) // 2 - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to `n` divided by 2, `right` is equal to `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 3` and greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2 - 2`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 2) // 2 - 1`, and `rightZero` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2 - 1`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to `(mid - 2) // 2 - 1`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 3) // 2 - 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
