Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is equal to `mid`, stdin is empty. If the character at the right index of string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]` plus 1, `trightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` minus 1, and `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `rightZero` is incremented by `(n-mid)` times plus the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid-1:mid-1+left]`, `trightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` minus 1, and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.***
