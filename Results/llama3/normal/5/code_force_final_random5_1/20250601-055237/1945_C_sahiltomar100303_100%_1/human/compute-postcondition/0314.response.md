Postcondition: ***`left` is not equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus `mid`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` - 3, `leftOne` is less than or equal to half of `n` - `mid` + 3, `rightZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` - `mid`, `right` is not equal to `n`. The current value of `left` is closer to or equally distant from the middle of `n` compared to the current value of `right`***
