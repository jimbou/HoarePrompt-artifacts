Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid - 1, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', rightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', trightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', trightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', If the character at index left of string s is '0', rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times minus 1, otherwise, leftOne is decremented by 1 and rightOne is incremented by 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1. The value of `left` is now `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne` are still valid but now they are related to the new value of `left`.
