Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, i is mid, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is mid, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is mid, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is '1', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is mid, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is mid, trightOne is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than mid, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is an integer and is less than n, i is equal to mid + 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, and rightOne and trightOne remain unchanged. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer and is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mid + 2`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 2, and `rightZero` and `trightZero` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
