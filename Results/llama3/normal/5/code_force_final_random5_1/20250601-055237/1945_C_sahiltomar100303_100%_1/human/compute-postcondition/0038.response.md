Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions, s is a string, mid is an integer and greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', rightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', trightZero is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '0', trightOne is incremented by (n-mid) times if the character at index i of string s is '1', stdin is empty, and the character at index left - 1 of string s is not '0', leftOne is decremented by 1, rightOne is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0. The value of `n` remains an integer and large enough to satisfy the conditions. The value of `s` remains a string. The value of `mid` remains an integer and greater than 0. The value of `i` remains equal to `n`. The value of `left` remains equal to `mid`. The value of `leftMove` remains 0. The values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0'. The values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by `(n-mid)` times if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1'. The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The stdin is empty. The character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is not '0'.
