Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of the first three strings in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `str` is the third string in the list**

The code appends the integer value of the third string in `list1` to `list2`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
