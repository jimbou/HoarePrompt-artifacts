Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` at even indices, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1`, `final` contains the sum of all elements in `list2` at even indices, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is the last even index of `list2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` which is the sum of all elements in `list2` at even indices has been appended to the `final` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
