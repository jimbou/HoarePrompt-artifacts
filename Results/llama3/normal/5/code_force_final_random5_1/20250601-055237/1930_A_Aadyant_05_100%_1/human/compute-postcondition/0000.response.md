Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7). n is an integer, final is an empty list.**

Explanation:
The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the first test case has been read, and `t-1` test cases remain in stdin. The second line initializes an empty list called `final`. No other variables are affected.
