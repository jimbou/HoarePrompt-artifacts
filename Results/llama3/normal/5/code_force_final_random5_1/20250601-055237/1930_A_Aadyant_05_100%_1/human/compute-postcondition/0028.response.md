The code snippet `list2.sort()` sorts the elements of `list2` in ascending order. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1`, `final` is 0, `num` is 1, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` is empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is the last even index of the updated `list2`.**
