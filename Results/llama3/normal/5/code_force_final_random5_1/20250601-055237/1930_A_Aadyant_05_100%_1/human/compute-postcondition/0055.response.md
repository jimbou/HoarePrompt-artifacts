Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing 0 and the sum of all elements in `list2`, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`.**

In this output state, the value of `final` has been updated to include the sum of all elements in `list2`, which is equal to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains t-6 test cases, and the other variables maintain their original values and relationships.
