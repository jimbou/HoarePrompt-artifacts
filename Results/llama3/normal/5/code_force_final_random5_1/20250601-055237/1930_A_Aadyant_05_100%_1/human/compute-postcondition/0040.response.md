Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is 0, `list2` contains one integer, `final` is a list containing 0, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` contains at least 1 string, `str` is the first string in `list1` which is an integer, `i` is undefined**

The code appends the integer value of `str` to `list2`. Since `str` is the first string in `list1` and it is an integer, `list2` now contains one integer. The values of the other variables are not affected.
