Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is equal to the sum of the first four elements of `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains at least 5 integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing 0, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the fourth element of `list2`, which is an integer from `list1` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
