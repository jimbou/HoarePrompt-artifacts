Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, s is 0, list2 is an empty list, final is an empty list, num is 0, list1 is a list of strings from the second line of input, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a string from the first line of input
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, s is 0, list2 contains the integer value of the first string in list1, final is an empty list, num is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a string from the first line of input, list1 is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, str is the first string in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of the first two strings in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `str` is the second string in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of the first three strings in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `str` is the third string in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
