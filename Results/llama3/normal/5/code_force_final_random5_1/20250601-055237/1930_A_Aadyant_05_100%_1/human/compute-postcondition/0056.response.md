Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `list2`, `num` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains t-(n+1) test cases, `a` is a string from the last line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be greater than or equal to 0, indicating the number of test cases processed. The variable `s` will hold the sum of all elements in `list2` at even indices, which are the sorted integers from `list1`. The list `list2` will contain all integers from `list1` in ascending order. The list `final` will contain the sum of all elements in `list2` for each test case. The variable `num` will be equal to `n`, indicating the number of iterations completed. The standard input `stdin` will contain `t-(n+1)` test cases, where `t` is the total number of test cases and `n` is the number of test cases processed. The variable `a` will hold a string from the last line of input, `list1` will not be empty and will contain the last set of integers from the input, `str` will be the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, and `i` will be equal to the length of `list2`, indicating the last index processed.
