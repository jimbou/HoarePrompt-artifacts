Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements at even indices of `list2`, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices of `list2`, `num` is 1, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` is empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is the last even index of `list2`.**

The value of `s` is appended to the list `final`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `final` now contains the sum of all elements at even indices of `list2`.
