Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `list2`, `num` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains t-(n+1) test cases, `a` is a string from the last line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, and all elements in the `final` list have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, all elements in the `final` list have been printed, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The loop has iterated over all elements in the `final` list and printed each one, but the values of `n`, `s`, `list2`, `num`, `stdin`, `a`, `list1`, `str`, and `i` remain the same as they were before the loop started executing.
