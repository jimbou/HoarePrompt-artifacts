Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 2, s is 0, list2 is empty, final is a list containing 0, num is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases, a is a string from the second line of input, list1 contains strings from the third line of input, str is empty, i is undefined.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is 0, `list2` contains one integer, `final` is a list containing 0, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` contains at least 1 string, `str` is the first string in `list1` which is an integer, `i` is undefined

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is 0, `list2` contains two integers, `final` is a list containing 0, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` contains at least 2 strings, `str` is the second string in `list1` which is an integer, `i` is undefined

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is 0, `list2` contains three integers, `final` is a list containing 0, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` contains at least 3 strings, `str` is the third string in `list1` which is an integer, `i` is undefined, and `list2` now includes the integer value of `str`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
