Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `list2`, `num` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains t-(n+1) test cases, `a` is a string from the last line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `list2`, `num` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains t-(n+1) test cases, `a` is a string from the last line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, and all elements in the `final` list have been printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to start with an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers. The function sorts these integers in ascending order, sums up every other integer starting from the first one, and stores these sums in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints out the sums stored in the list. The function does not return any value but instead prints the results directly.
