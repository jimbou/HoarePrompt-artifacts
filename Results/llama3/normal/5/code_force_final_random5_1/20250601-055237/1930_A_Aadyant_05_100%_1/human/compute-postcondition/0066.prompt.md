Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `list2`, `num` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains t-(n+1) test cases, `a` is a string from the last line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`.
Code of the loop:
for fin in final:
    print(fin)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `list2` that must have at least 1 element, `num` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains t-(n+1) test cases, `a` is a string from the last line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, `fin` is the first element in the `final` list, and the first element in the `final` list which is the sum of all elements in `list2` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `list2` that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains t-(n+1) test cases, `a` is a string from the last line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, and the second element in the `final` list which is `fin` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `list2` that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains t-(n+1) test cases, `a` is a string from the last line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, and the third element in the `final` list which is `fin` is printed, and the third element in the `final` list which is `fin` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
