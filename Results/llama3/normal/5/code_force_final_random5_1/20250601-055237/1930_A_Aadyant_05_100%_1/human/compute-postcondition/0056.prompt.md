Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7). n is an integer, final is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` at even indices, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1`, `final` contains the sum of all elements in `list2` at even indices, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is the last even index of `list2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements at even indices of `list2`, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices of `list2`, `num` is 1, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` is empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is the last even index of `list2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements in `list2` which are integers from `list1` in ascending order, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing 0 and the sum of all elements in `list2`, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` is not empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
