Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads the `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is a crucial step in finding the maximum final score.
4. It then sums up every other integer starting from the first one, which is equivalent to adding the minimum of each pair of integers to the score.
5. It stores these sums in a list and prints them out after processing all test cases.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem description's requirements. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
