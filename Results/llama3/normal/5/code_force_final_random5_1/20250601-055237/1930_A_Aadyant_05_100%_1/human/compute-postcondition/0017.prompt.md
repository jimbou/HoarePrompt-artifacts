Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
    s = s + int(list2[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is equal to the first element of `list2`, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1` and must have at least 2 elements, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is equal to the first element of `list2` plus the third element of `list2`, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1` and must have at least 3 elements, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is equal to the first element of `list2` plus the third element of `list2` plus the fifth element of `list2`, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1` and must have at least 5 elements, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `a` is a string from the first line of input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
