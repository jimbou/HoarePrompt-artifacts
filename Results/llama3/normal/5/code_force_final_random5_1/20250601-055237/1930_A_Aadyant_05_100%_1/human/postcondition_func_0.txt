This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to start with an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers. The function sorts these integers in ascending order, sums up every other integer starting from the first one, and stores these sums in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints out the sums stored in the list. The function does not return any value but instead prints the results directly.
