Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is 0, `list2` contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order, `final` is a list containing 0, `num` is 2, `stdin` contains t-6 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` is empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1` which is an integer, `i` is undefined.**

The code sorts the elements in `list2` in ascending order, but does not change the values of the other variables. The `list2` now contains all integers from `list1` in ascending order.
