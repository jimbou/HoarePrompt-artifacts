Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, s is 0, list2 contains the integer value of the first string in list1, final is an empty list, num is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a is a string from the first line of input, list1 is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, str is the first string in the list**

In this output state, the code has appended the integer value of the first string in list1 to list2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, and the other variables maintain their initial values.
