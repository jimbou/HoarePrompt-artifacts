Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is equal to the first element of `list2`, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1` and must have at least 1 element, `final` is 0, `num` is 1, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `a` is a string from the second line of input, `list1` is empty, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be equal to the first element of `list2`, which is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `list2` is still non-empty and contains the sorted integer values of all strings in `list1`, and `i` is still 0.
