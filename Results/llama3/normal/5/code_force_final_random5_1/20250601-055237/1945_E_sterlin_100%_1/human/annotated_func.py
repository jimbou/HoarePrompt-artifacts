#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is greater than 0, which is the input provided by the user through stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input from the user through stdin and returns the same integer, which is greater than 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a value from the space-separated list of integers provided in the standard input (stdin).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input, converts each integer to an integer data type, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string
    return input()
    #The program returns the string that was inputted from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input and returns it without modification.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string of space-separated values of any type and value.
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string, and each string can be of any type and value.

#Overall this is what the function does:Takes a string of space-separated values as input, splits it into individual values, and returns them as a list of strings, where each string can be of any type and value.
