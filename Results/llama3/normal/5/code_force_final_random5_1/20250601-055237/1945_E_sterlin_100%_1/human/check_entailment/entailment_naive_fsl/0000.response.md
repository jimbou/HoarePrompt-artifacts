Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to perform binary search on a permutation of size n to find a number x, and to perform at most 2 operations to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the provided program does not implement the binary search algorithm or the rearrangement of the permutation.

The program only defines five functions (func_1 to func_5) that read input from the user, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem. The program does not perform any operations on the input permutation or the target number x.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
