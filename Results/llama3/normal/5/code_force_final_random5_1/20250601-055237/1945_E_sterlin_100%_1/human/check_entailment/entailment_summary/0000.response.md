Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a modified binary search algorithm. The program is allowed to perform at most two swap operations on the permutation before running the binary search algorithm.

The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific task:

1. `func_1()`: Reads an integer input from the user, which represents the number of test cases.
2. `func_2()`: Reads two integers `n` and `x` from the user, where `n` is the length of the permutation and `x` is the number to be found.
3. `func_3()`: Reads a space-separated list of integers from the user, which represents the permutation `p`.
4. `func_4()` and `func_5()`: Not used in the program.

The main logic of the program is as follows:

* Create a dictionary `num_indx` to store the indices of each number in the permutation.
* Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to 0 and `n`, respectively.
* Perform a modified binary search algorithm:
	+ If `left + 1 < right`, calculate the midpoint `mid` and check if `p[mid] <= x`. If true, update `left` to `mid`. Otherwise, update `right` to `mid`.
	+ If `p[left] == x`, print 0 and exit.
	+ If `x` is not found in the permutation, check if `x` is present in the permutation but not at the correct index. If true, print 1 and swap the indices of `x` and `left + 1`.
	+ If `x` is not found in the permutation and not present at the correct index, perform two swap operations to move `x` to the correct index and print 2.

The program correctly implements the modified binary search algorithm and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
