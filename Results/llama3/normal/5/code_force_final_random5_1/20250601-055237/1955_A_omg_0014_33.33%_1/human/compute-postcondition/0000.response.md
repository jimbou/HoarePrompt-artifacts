The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). The first integer in the stdin is assigned to `n`. The value of `n` is now equal to the first integer in the stdin which is t (1 <= t <= 10^4). The stdin now contains t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**
