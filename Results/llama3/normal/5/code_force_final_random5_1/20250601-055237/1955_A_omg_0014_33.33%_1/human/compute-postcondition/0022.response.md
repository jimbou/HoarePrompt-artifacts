The code prints the rounded value of the product of a and d, where a is an integer between 1 and 100, and d is a float equal to half of c, and c is an integer between 1 and 30.
Output: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 100, b is an integer between 1 and 30, c is an integer between 1 and 30, d is a float equal to half of c, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and the rounded value of the product of a and d is printed**
