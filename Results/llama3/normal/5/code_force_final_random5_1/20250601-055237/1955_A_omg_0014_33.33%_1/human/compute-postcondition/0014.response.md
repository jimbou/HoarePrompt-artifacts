To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:

*   `n` is an integer greater than 0.
*   `i` is 1.
*   `a` is an integer between 1 and 100.
*   `b` is an integer between 1 and 30.
*   `c` is an integer between 1 and 30.
*   `d` is a float equal to half of `c`.
*   `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30).

Code Snippet:

```python
print(round(a * d))
```

Now, let's analyze the code snippet:

*   The `print` statement is used to output the result of the expression `round(a * d)`.
*   `a` is an integer between 1 and 100.
*   `d` is a float equal to half of `c`, where `c` is an integer between 1 and 30. This means `d` will be a float between 0.5 and 15.0.

When the `print` statement is executed, it will output the result of multiplying `a` by `d` and then rounding the result to the nearest integer using the `round` function.

Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `d` is a float between 0.5 and 15.0, the product `a * d` will be a float between 0.5 and 1500.0. After rounding, the result will be an integer between 1 and 1500.

Therefore, the output will be an integer between 1 and 1500, which is the result of multiplying `a` by half of `c` and then rounding to the nearest integer.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 1500 (which is the result of multiplying a by half of c and then rounding to the nearest integer)**
