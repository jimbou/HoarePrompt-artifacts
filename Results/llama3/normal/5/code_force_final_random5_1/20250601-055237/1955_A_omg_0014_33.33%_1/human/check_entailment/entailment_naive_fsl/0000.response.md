Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the number of yogurts (n) is odd, the program does not consider the optimal strategy of buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price.

In the given example, when n = 3, a = 5, and b = 9, the program prints 14, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 15, which can be achieved by buying two yogurts at the promotion price (9 burles) and one yogurt at the regular price (5 burles).

The program only compares the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price, but it does not consider the case where the number of yogurts is odd and the optimal strategy is to buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price.
