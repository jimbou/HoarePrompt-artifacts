Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes the number of test cases (t) as input, followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b.

The program then iterates over each test case, calculates the price of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) and the price of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d, where d is half of the promotion price c).

The program then compares the two prices and prints the minimum one. However, there is a logical error in the comparison. The program checks if a * b is less than a * d, which is incorrect. The correct comparison should be between the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)).

Moreover, the program uses the rounded value of the product of a and d, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price and compare it with the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price.

Correctness: **False**
