This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where each line contains three integers: n, a, and b. It then calculates the product of a and b, and the product of a and half of c. If the product of a and b is less than the product of a and half of c, it prints the product of a and b; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of the product of a and half of c. This process is repeated for a number of times specified by the initial input integer t.
