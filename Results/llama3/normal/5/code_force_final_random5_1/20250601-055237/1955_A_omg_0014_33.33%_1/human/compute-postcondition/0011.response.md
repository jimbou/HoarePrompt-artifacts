Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, a is an integer between 1 and 100, b is an integer between 1 and 30, c is an integer between 1 and 30, d is a float equal to half of c, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers n, a, and b. These values are assigned to the variables a, b, and c, respectively. The value of c is then divided by 2 and assigned to d. The values of n and i remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b.
