According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**
