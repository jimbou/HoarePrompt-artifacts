Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 100, b is an integer between 1 and 30, c is an integer between 1 and 30, d is a float equal to half of c, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If the product of a and b is less than the product of a and d, the product of a and b is printed. Otherwise, the rounded value of the product of a and d is printed.***
