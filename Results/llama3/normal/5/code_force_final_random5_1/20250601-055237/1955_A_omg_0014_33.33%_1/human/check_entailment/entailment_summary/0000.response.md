Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

The program then calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) and the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), where d is half of the promotion price (c / 2).

The program then compares the two costs and prints the minimum cost. However, there is a logical error in the comparison. The program checks if the product of a and b is less than the product of a and half of c, which is not the correct condition.

The correct condition should be to check if the product of a and b is less than or equal to the product of a and half of c. This is because if the two costs are equal, the program should print the product of a and b, not the rounded value of the product of a and half of c.

Moreover, the program uses the round function to round the product of a and half of c, which is not necessary. The product of a and half of c is already an integer, so rounding it will not change its value.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
