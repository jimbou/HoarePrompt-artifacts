Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 100, b is an integer between 1 and 30, c is an integer between 1 and 30, d is a float equal to half of c, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to a, b, and c. The value of d is calculated as half of c. The values of n and i remain unchanged. Stdin now contains t-4 lines.
