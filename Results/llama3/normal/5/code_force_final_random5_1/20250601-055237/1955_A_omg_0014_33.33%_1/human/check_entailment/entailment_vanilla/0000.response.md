Reasoning:

1. The problem asks us to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, given the price of one yogurt (a) and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b).

2. The program defines a function func() that reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (a), the price of one yogurt (b), and the price of two yogurts on promotion (c).

4. It calculates the price of one yogurt if bought in pairs (d = c / 2).

5. If the total cost of buying 'a' yogurts at the regular price (a * b) is less than the total cost of buying 'a' yogurts in pairs (a * d), it prints the former. Otherwise, it prints the latter.

6. However, there is a logical error in the program. The condition in the if statement should be checking if the total cost of buying 'a' yogurts at the regular price is less than or equal to the total cost of buying 'a' yogurts in pairs, not just less than. This is because if the costs are equal, buying at the regular price is still a valid option.

7. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where 'a' is odd. In such cases, Maxim cannot buy all yogurts in pairs, so he will have to buy one yogurt at the regular price and the rest in pairs.

8. The program also uses the round() function to round the result to the nearest integer, which is unnecessary because the result should always be an integer.

Correctness: **False**
