Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 100, b is an integer between 1 and 30, c is an integer between 1 and 30, d is a float equal to half of c, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). The current value of a times b is less than the current value of a times d.**
