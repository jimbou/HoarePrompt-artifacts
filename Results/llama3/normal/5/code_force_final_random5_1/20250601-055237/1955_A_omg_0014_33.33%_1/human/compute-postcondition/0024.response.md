Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, a is an integer between 1 and 100, b is an integer between 1 and 30, c is an integer between 1 and 30, d is a float equal to half of c, stdin contains t-n lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If the product of a and b is less than the product of a and d, the product of a and b is printed. Otherwise, the rounded value of the product of a and d is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be greater than or equal to 0 (since it started as a positive integer and was decremented in each iteration), `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n` (since it was incremented in each iteration), and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will be the same as in the previous iterations (since they are not modified outside the loop). The number of lines in stdin will be reduced by the number of iterations of the loop. The loop will continue to print the product of `a` and `b` if it is less than the product of `a` and `d`, or the rounded value of the product of `a` and `d` otherwise.
