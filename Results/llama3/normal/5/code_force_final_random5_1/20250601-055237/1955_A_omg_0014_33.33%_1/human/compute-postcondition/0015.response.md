The code prints the rounded value of the product of `a` and `d`. Where `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `d` is a float equal to half of `c`, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 30.
Output: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, a is an integer between 1 and 100, b is an integer between 1 and 30, c is an integer between 1 and 30, d is a float equal to half of c, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and the rounded value of the product of a and d is printed**
