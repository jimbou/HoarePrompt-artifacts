Reasoning:

The given program is almost correct, but it has a logical error. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer. However, in the main part of the program, the loop `for i in range(n):` is iterating from 0 to n-1, but it should iterate from 1 to n (inclusive) according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
