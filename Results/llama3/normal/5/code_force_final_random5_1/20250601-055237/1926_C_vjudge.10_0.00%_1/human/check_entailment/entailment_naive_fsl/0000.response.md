Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The issue lies in the fact that the program is adding the sum of the digits of each number from 0 to n, instead of from 1 to n.

For example, when n = 12, the program will calculate the sum of the digits of the numbers from 0 to 12, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should start from 1, not 0.

To fix this issue, the program should start the loop from 1 instead of 0. Here is the corrected code:

```python
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
```

With this correction, the program will correctly calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.
