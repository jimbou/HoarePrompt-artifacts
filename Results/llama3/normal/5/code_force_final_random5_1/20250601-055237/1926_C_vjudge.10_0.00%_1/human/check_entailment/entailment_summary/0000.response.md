Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number, and then sums up these values for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The variable `soma` is initialized to 0 and then used to accumulate the sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` for all test cases. But the program does not reset `soma` to 0 after each test case, which means that the sum of the sums of the digits for each test case is added to the sum of the previous test cases.

This is incorrect because the problem statement requires the program to output the sum of the numbers on the board for each test case separately.

Correctness: **False**
