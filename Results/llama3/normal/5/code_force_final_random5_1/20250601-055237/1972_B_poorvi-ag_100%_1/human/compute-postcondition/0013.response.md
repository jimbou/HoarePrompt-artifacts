To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The states of `results`, `n`, `arr`, and `stdin` are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing two strings. The first string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. The second string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases.**
