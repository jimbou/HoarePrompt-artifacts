The code prints the value of `i`, which is `t-1`. Since `t` is greater than 0, `i` will be a positive integer less than `t`. The exact value of `i` depends on the value of `t`, which is not specified in the precondition. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is one less than the value of `t`.

Output: **t-1 (where t is a positive integer greater than 0)**
