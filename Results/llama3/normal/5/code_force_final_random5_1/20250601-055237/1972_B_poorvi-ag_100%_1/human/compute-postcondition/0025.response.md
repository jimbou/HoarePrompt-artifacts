The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and results, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 2 strings the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least `t+1` strings, i is `t`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least `t+2` strings and the i is `t+1`.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `t+1`, `results` is a list containing `t+2` strings, each string is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd, otherwise it is 'no', `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains 0 inputs: 0 test cases, and the value of `i` which is `t+1` is being printed, where `t+1` is greater than 0**
