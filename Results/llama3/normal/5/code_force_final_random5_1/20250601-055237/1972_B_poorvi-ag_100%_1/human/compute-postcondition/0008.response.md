The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, results is a list containing one string. If the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, results contains 'yes'. Otherwise, results contains 'no'. stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**
