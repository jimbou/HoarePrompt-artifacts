Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". The number of 'U' characters in arr is even***
