Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing 'no', stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". The number of 'U' characters in arr is even**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'no'. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 inputs, each representing a test case with an integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" characters, where the number of 'U' characters in arr is even.
