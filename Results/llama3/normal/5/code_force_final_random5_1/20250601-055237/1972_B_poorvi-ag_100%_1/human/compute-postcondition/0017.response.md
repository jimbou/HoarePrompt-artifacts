Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, results is a list containing three strings. The first two strings in results are 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise they are 'no'. The third string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains t-4 inputs: t-4 test cases.***
