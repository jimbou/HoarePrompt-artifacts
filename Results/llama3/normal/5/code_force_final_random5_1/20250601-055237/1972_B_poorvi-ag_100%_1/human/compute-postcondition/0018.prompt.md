Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 100, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D".
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, i is 0, results is a list containing one string. If the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, results contains 'yes'. Otherwise, results contains 'no'. stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 1, i is 1, results is a list containing two strings. The first string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. The second string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains t-3 inputs: t-3 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 2, i is 2, results is a list containing three strings. The first two strings in results are 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise they are 'no'. The third string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains t-4 inputs: t-4 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
