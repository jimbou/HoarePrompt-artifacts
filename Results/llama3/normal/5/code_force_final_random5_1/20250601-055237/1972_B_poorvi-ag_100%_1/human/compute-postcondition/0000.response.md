The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is between 1 and 100, `t` becomes an integer between 1 and 100. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D".**
