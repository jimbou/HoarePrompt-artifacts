Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, i is t-1, results is a list containing t strings. Each string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains 0 inputs: 0 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable t will be greater than or equal to 0, the variable i will be equal to t-1, and the list results will contain t strings. Each string in results will be 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it will be 'no'. The variable n will be an integer between 1 and 100, and the string arr will be of length n containing only "U" and "D". The standard input (stdin) will contain 0 inputs, meaning all test cases have been processed.
