Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, results is a list containing one string. If the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, results contains 'yes'. Otherwise, results contains 'no'. stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".***
