Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing three strings, the first two strings are 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd, otherwise they are 'no', the third string is 'no', `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains `t-4` inputs: `t-4` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` is still greater than 2, the value of `i` is still 2, the list `results` now contains three strings, the first two strings are 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd, otherwise they are 'no', and the third string is 'no'. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100, and `arr` is still a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The stdin still contains `t-4` inputs, which are `t-4` test cases.
