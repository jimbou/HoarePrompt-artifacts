Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing one string 'yes', stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". The current value of arr has an odd number of 'U's**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0, `i` is still 0, and `results` now contains one string 'yes'. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each with an integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". The current value of arr still has an odd number of 'U's.
