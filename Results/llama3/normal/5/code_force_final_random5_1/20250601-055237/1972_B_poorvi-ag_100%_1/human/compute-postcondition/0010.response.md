Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing two strings, the first string is either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd or even, the second string is 'yes', `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include an additional string 'yes'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` inputs, which are the remaining test cases.
