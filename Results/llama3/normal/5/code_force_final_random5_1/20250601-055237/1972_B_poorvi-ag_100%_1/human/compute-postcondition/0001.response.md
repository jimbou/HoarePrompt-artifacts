The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 100 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D"**
