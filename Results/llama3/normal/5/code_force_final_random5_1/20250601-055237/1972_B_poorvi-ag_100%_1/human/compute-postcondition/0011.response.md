Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing two strings, where the first string is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the number of 'U' characters in `arr`, and the second string is 'no', `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include an additional string 'no'. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" still holds. The stdin still contains `t-3` inputs: `t-3` test cases.
