Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 1, results is a list containing two strings. The first string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. The second string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains t-3 inputs: t-3 test cases.***
