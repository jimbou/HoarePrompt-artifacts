Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `results` is a list containing `t` strings, each string is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd, otherwise it is 'no', `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains 0 inputs: 0 test cases, and all values in `results` have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all elements in the `results` list, printing each value. The loop has terminated, and the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged.
