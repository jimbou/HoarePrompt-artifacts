Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, results is a list containing three strings. The first string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. The second string in results is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in arr is odd, otherwise it is 'no'. The third string in results is 'yes'. n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains t-4 inputs: t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of t, i, n, and arr remains the same as in the initial state. The list results now contains three strings. The first two strings in results are determined by the number of 'U' characters in arr, and the third string is 'yes' as appended by the code. The stdin still contains t-4 inputs.
