Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 inputs: t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", n is an integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D"**

The code reads an integer `n` and a string `arr` from the input. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100, and the string `arr` has a length of `n` and contains only the characters "U" and "D". The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the list `results` is still empty. The input buffer now contains `t-2` test cases.
