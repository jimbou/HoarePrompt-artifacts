Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. The logic for determining whether Alice will win the game is also correct. If the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win.

The program uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the count of "U" characters is odd or even. If the remainder of the division of the count by 2 is 1, the count is odd, and Alice will win. Otherwise, the count is even, and Bob will win.

The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the number of test cases, processing each test case, and printing the results in the correct format.

Correctness: **True**
