To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `results` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty. Since `t` is greater than or equal to 0 and `results` contains `t` strings, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0 to ensure `results` is not empty.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `t-1`, `results` is a list containing `t` strings, each string is 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd, otherwise it is 'no', `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains 0 inputs: 0 test cases**
