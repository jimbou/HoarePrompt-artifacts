To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for val_b in main_ar:`, which means we are iterating over the elements of `main_ar`. The only variable in the loop head is `val_b`.

According to the given state, `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair. Since we are iterating over the elements of `main_ar`, we need to adjust the state of `val_b` to point to the next pair in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `val_b` is the first pair in the list. To execute the loop again, `val_b` should point to the next pair in the list. Since `main_ar` has at least 1 pair, we can assume that there is at least one more pair in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of the second pair in the list if the sum of the elements of the second pair is greater than or equal to 0. `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the second pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of the second pair is greater than or equal to 0, then the current value of `val_b` is a pair of integers where the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to 0.**
