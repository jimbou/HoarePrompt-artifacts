Postcondition: ***`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the second pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of the second pair is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of the second pair in the list. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr`.***
