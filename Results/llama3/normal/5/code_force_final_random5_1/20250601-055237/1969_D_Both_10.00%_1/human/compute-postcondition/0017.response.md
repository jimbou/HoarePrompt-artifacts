Postcondition: ***`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the third pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of the third pair is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of the third pair in the list plus the sum of the elements of the third pair in the list. Otherwise, there is no change in `sub_summ`***
