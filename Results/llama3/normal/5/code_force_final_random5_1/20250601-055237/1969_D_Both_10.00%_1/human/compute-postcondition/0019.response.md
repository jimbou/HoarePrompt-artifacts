Output State: **The program returns the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of all pairs in the initial `main_ar` where the sum of the elements of each pair is greater than or equal to 0. Since both `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are empty lists, the sum of the first elements of all pairs in `sec_arr` is 0 and the sum of the elements of all pairs in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements of each pair is greater than or equal to 0 is also 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.**
