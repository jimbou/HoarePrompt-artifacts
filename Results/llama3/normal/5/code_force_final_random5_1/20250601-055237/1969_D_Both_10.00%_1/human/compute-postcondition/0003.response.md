To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only variable in the loop head is `val_a`, which is an element of `sec_arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sec_arr` has at least 1 pair, `val_a` is the first pair in `sec_arr`.

For the loop to execute again, `sec_arr` must have at least 2 pairs, and `val_a` must be the second pair in `sec_arr`. The value of `sub_summ` is not relevant to the loop condition, but it will be updated to the first element of the second pair in `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sub_summ` is equal to the first element of the second pair in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the second pair in `sec_arr`**
