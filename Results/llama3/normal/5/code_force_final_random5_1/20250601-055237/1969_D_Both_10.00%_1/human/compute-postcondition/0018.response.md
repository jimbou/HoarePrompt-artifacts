Output State: **`main_ar` is an empty list, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of all pairs in the initial `main_ar` where the sum of the elements of each pair is greater than or equal to 0, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the last pair in the initial `main_ar`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `main_ar` list is empty, the `sec_arr` list remains empty, the `sub_summ` variable is updated to include the sum of the elements of all pairs in the initial `main_ar` list where the sum of the elements of each pair is greater than or equal to 0, the `val_a` variable remains the last pair in the initial `sec_arr` list, and the `val_b` variable is the last pair in the initial `main_ar` list.
