Let's break down the code and its impact on the program.

The code is `sub_summ += val_a[0]`. This means we are adding the value of `val_a[0]` to `sub_summ`.

From the initial state, we know that `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first element of the third pair in `sec_arr` and the first element of the third pair in `sec_arr`. We also know that `val_a` is the third pair in `sec_arr`.

Since `val_a` is the third pair in `sec_arr`, `val_a[0]` is the first element of the third pair in `sec_arr`. Therefore, we are adding the first element of the third pair in `sec_arr` to `sub_summ`.

Let's denote the first element of the third pair in `sec_arr` as `x`. Then, `sub_summ` is initially equal to `x + x = 2x`. After the code is executed, `sub_summ` becomes `2x + x = 3x`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sub_summ` is equal to 3 times the first element of the third pair in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the third pair in `sec_arr`.**
