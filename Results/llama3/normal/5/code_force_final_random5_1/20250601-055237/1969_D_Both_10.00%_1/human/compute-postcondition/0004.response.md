Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first element of the second pair in `sec_arr` and the first element of the second pair in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the second pair in `sec_arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of pairs of integers in `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remains unchanged. The value of `sub_summ` is increased by the first element of the second pair in `sec_arr`, which is the same as the first element of `val_a`. The value of `val_a` remains the same as the second pair in `sec_arr`.
