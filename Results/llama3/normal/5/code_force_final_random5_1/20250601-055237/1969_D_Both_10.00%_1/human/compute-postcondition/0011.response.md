Postcondition: ***`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of `val_b` if the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then the current value of `val_b` is a pair of integers where the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to 0.***
