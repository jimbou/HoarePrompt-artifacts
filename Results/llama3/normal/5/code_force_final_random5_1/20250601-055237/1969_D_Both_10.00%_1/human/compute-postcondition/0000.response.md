Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively; `sub_summ` is 0**

In this output state, the lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The variable `sub_summ` is assigned the value 0, which is a new addition to the state. The rest of the state remains the same, with `main_ar` and `sec_arr` still being lists of pairs of integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, respectively.
