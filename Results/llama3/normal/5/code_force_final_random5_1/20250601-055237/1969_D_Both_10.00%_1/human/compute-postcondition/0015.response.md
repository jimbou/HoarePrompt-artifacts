The only variable in the loop head is variable  val_b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the main_ar.  If the list has at least 3 pairs the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, main_ar has at least 2 pairs, val_a is the last pair in the initial sec_arr, val_b is the second pair in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 pairs and the val_b is the third pair in the list.
State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the third pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of the third pair is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of the third pair in the list. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr`.**
