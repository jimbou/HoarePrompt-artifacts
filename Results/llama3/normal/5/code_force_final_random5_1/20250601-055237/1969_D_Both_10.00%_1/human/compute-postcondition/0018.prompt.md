Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`.
Code of the loop:
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of `val_b` if the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then the current value of `val_b` is a pair of integers where the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the second pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of the second pair is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of the second pair in the list. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the third pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of the third pair is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of the third pair in the list plus the sum of the elements of the third pair in the list. Otherwise, there is no change in `sub_summ`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
