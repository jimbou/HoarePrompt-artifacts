To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `val_a` and `sec_arr`. The loop will execute if `sec_arr` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sec_arr` to have at least one element, and `val_a` will be the first element in `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sub_summ` is 0, `val_a` is the first pair in `sec_arr`**
