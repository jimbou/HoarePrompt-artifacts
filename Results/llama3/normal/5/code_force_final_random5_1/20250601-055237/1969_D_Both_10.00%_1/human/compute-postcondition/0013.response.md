Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of the second pair in the list if the sum of the elements of the second pair is greater than or equal to 0 plus the sum of the elements of the second pair in the list, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the second pair in the list. If the sum of the elements of the second pair is greater than or equal to 0, then the current value of `val_b` is a pair of integers where the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `sub_summ` has been updated to include the sum of the elements of the second pair in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
