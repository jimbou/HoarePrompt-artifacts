According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `main_ar`. If `main_ar` has at least 1 pair of integers, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`. For the loop to be executed, `main_ar` must have at least 1 pair of integers and `val_b` is the first pair in the list.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first pair in the list**
