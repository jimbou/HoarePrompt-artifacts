Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of `val_b`, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first pair in the list. The current value of `val_b` is a pair of integers where the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `sub_summ` has been updated to include the sum of the elements of `val_b`, which is the first pair in the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, as specified in the initial state.
