Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively; `sub_summ` is 0
Code of the loop:
for val_a in sec_arr:
    sub_summ += val_a[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sub_summ` is equal to the first element of the first pair in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the first pair in `sec_arr`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first element of the second pair in `sec_arr` and the first element of the second pair in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the second pair in `sec_arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sub_summ` is equal to 3 times the first element of the third pair in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the third pair in `sec_arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
