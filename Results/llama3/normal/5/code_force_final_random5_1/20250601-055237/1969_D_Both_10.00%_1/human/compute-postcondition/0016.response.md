Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the third pair in the list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of the elements of the third pair in the list plus the sum of the elements of the third pair in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of pairs of integers `main_ar` remains unchanged with at least 3 pairs, the list `sec_arr` is still empty, the last pair in the initial `sec_arr` is still stored in `val_a`, the third pair in the list is still stored in `val_b`, and the variable `sub_summ` now holds the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus twice the sum of the elements of the third pair in the list.
