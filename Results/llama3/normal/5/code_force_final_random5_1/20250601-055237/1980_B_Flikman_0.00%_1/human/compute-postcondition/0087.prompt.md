Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least n values, favorite_value is equal to the nth value in the list, same_value_count is 0, and stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least 1 value, favorite_value is equal to the first value in the list, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and value is the first value in the list. If value is equal to favorite_value, then same_value_count is 1. Otherwise, same_value_count remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list that must have at least 2 values, `favorite_value` is equal to the first value in the list, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `value` is the second value in the list, and `same_value_count` is either 1 or 2 if `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 values, `favorite_value` is equal to the first value in the list, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `value` is the third value in the list. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
