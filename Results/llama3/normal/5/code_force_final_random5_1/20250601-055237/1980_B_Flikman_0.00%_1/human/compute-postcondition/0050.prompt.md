Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a[f-1], same_value_count is 0, and greater_count is still equal to the number of integers in the list a that are greater than favorite_value.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a[f-1]`, `same_value_count` is 1 if the first integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` is 0, `greater_count` is equal to the number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a[f-1]`, `same_value_count` is 2 if the first integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value` and the next integer is also equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` is 1, `greater_count` is equal to the number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `value` is the next integer in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a[f-1]`, if the next integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 3 if the first integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value` and the next integer is also equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` is 2. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 2 if the first integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value` and the next integer is also equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` remains 1. `greater_count` is equal to the number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
