Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `same_value_count` is equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the list `a`, and `greater_count` is equal to the number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. The number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value` is less than `k`. The current value of `greater_count` plus `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`.**
