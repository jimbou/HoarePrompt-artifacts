Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least n values, value is the nth value in the list, favorite_value is equal to the value of a[f-1], same_value_count is equal to the number of integers in the list a that are equal to favorite_value, and greater_count is equal to the number of integers in the list a that are greater than the favorite_value. If greater_count is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of greater_count and same_value_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.***
