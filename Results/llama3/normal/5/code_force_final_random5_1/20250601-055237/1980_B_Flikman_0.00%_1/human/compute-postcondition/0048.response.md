Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a[f-1]`, `same_value_count` is 3 if the first integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value` and the next integer is also equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` is 2, `greater_count` is equal to the number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `value` is the next integer in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. If the first integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value` and the next integer is also equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
