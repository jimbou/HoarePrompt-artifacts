Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, favorite_value is an integer. If the value is equal to favorite_value, then same_value_count is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the third integer in the list is equal to favorite_value or not. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. If the value is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is either 2 or 3, depending on whether the third integer in the list is equal to `favorite_value` or not. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
