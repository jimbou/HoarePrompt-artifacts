Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    same_value_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value == favorite_value:
            same_value_count += 1
    greater_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value > favorite_value:
            greater_count += 1
    if greater_count >= k:
        print('YES')
    elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `same_value_count` is equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the list `a`, and `greater_count` is equal to the number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If the number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value` is greater than or equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least n values, value is the nth value in the list, favorite_value is equal to the value of a[f-1], same_value_count is equal to the number of integers in the list a that are equal to favorite_value, and greater_count is equal to the number of integers in the list a that are greater than the favorite_value. If greater_count is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of greater_count and same_value_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least n values, favorite_value is equal to the nth value in the list, value is the nth value in the list, same_value_count is equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in the list, greater_count is the number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. If the sum of the number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value and the number of occurrences of the nth value is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
