Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, favorite_value is an integer, same_value_count is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the second integer in the list is equal to favorite_value or not.**

In this output state, the value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. If the second integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is now 2, otherwise it remains 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
