Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3. It then reads the values shown on the cubes `a`.
4. It determines the value of Dmitry's favorite cube `favorite_value`.
5. It counts the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube `same_value_count`.
6. It counts the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube `greater_count`.
7. Based on these counts, it determines the outcome:
   - If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, so it prints "YES".
   - If `greater_count` plus `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will not be removed in any case, so it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, the favorite cube may be either removed or left, so it prints "MAYBE".

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct outcome for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
