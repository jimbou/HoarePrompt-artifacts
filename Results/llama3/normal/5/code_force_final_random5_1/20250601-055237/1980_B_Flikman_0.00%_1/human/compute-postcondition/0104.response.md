Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least n values, favorite_value is equal to the nth value in the list, value is the nth value in the list, same_value_count is equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in the list, greater_count is the number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value is less than k. The current value of (greater_count + same_value_count) is less than or equal to k***
