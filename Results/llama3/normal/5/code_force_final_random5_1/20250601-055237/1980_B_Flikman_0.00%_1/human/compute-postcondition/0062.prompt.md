Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is an empty list, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a[f-1], same_value_count is equal to the number of integers in the list a that are equal to favorite_value, greater_count is 0.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value > favorite_value:
        greater_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least 1 value, value is the first value in the list, favorite_value is equal to the value of a[f-1], same_value_count is equal to the number of integers in the list a that are equal to favorite_value, and greater_count is 1 if the first value in the list is greater than the favorite_value, otherwise greater_count is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least 2 values, value is the second value in the list, favorite_value is equal to the value of a[f-1], same_value_count is equal to the number of integers in the list a that are equal to favorite_value, and greater_count is 2 if the second value in the list is greater than the favorite_value, otherwise greater_count is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least 3 values, value is the third value in the list, favorite_value is equal to the value of a[f-1], same_value_count is equal to the number of integers in the list a that are equal to favorite_value, and greater_count is 3 if the third value in the list is greater than the favorite_value, otherwise greater_count is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
