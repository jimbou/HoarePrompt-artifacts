Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 values, `favorite_value` is equal to the nth value in the list, `value` is the third value in the list, `same_value_count` is equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the list, `greater_count` is 3 if the third value in the list is greater than the nth value, otherwise it is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `greater_count` has been incremented by 1. If the third value in the list is greater than the nth value, `greater_count` is now 3; otherwise, it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
