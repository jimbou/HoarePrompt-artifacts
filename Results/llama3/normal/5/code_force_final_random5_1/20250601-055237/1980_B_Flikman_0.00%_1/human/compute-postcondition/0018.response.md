Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, the current value of `value` is the first integer in the list `a`, `same_value_count` is equal to the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the list `a`, and if `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 1, otherwise `greater_count` is 0.***
