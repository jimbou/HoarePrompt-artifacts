Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a[f-1]`, `same_value_count` is 1 if the first integer in the list `a` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` is 0, `greater_count` is equal to the number of integers in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`***
