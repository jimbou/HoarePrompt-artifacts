Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer, same_value_count is equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in the list a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same_value_count variable equal to the total number of times the favorite_value appears in the list a. The other variables remain unchanged.
