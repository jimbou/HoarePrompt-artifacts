Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 values, `favorite_value` is equal to the first value in the list, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `value` is the third value in the list, and `same_value_count` is either 2 or 3 if `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `same_value_count` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is now either 2 or 3, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
