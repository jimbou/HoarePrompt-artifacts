Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least n values, favorite_value is equal to the nth value in the list, value is the nth value in the list, same_value_count is equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in the list, greater_count is the number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. If the sum of the number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value and the number of occurrences of the nth value is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.***
