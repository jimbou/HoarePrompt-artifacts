Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, favorite_value is an integer. If the value is equal to favorite_value, then same_value_count is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the second integer in the list is equal to favorite_value or not. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
