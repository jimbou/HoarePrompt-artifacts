Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, favorite_value is an integer, same_value_count is 0
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, favorite_value is an integer, if the first integer in the list is equal to favorite_value, then same_value_count is 1, otherwise same_value_count remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, favorite_value is an integer. If the value is equal to favorite_value, then same_value_count is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the second integer in the list is equal to favorite_value or not. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, favorite_value is an integer. If the value is equal to favorite_value, then same_value_count is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the third integer in the list is equal to favorite_value or not. Otherwise, same_value_count is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the third integer in the list is equal to favorite_value or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
