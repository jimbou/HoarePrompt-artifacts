Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 values, `favorite_value` is equal to the first value in the list, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `value` is the third value in the list. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 1.***
