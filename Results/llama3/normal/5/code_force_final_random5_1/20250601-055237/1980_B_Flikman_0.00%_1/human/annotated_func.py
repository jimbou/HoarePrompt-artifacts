#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin is empty, _ is t, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list that must have at least n values, favorite_value is equal to the nth value in the list, value is the nth value in the list, same_value_count is equal to the number of occurrences of favorite_value in the list, greater_count is the number of values in the list that are greater than the nth value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers and two parameters, f and k. For each test case, it determines the favorite value (the value at index f-1 in the list), counts the occurrences of this favorite value, and counts the values greater than the favorite value. Based on these counts, it prints 'YES' if there are at least k values greater than the favorite value, 'NO' if the total count of favorite and greater values is less than or equal to k, and 'MAYBE' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.
