Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input, `i` is equal to the length of `e` plus 1, `q` is the first character in `e`, `n` is greater than the length of `e` plus 1, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.***
