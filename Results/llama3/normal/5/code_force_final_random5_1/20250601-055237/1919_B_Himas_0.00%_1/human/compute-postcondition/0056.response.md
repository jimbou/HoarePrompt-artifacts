Output: **s is an integer equal to the first input, e is a non-empty string equal to the second input, i is equal to the length of e plus 1, q is the last character in e, n is greater than the length of e plus 1, stdin contains at least one fewer lines of input. P is equal to the number of '+' characters in e and M is equal to the number of characters in e that are not '+'. The difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in e is being printed, which is P - M.**
