Output State: **s is an integer equal to the first input, e is a non-empty string equal to the second input, i is equal to the length of e plus 1, q is the last character in e, n is greater than the length of e plus 1, stdin contains at least one fewer lines of input. P is equal to the number of '+' characters in e and M is equal to the number of characters in e that are not '+'.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `s`, `e`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` as the initial state. The value of `q` will be the last character in the string `e`. The values of `P` and `M` will be the count of '+' characters and non-'+' characters in the string `e`, respectively.
