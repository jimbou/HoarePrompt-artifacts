The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and the input to int(input()). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input to int(input()). If `i` is less than the input to int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` is 1 and stdin contains at least one fewer lines of input.
State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string, `i` is 1, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+', stdin contains at least one fewer lines of input, and the difference between the number of '+' characters in `e` and the number of characters in `e` that are not '+' is being printed, which is P - M**
