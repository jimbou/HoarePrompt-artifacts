Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in each string, and prints the result. The program also handles multiple test cases correctly.

The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the arrays b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are split such that the sum of each array is either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty of an array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the absolute value of 1 or -1 is 1.

By counting the number of '+' characters (P) and '-' characters (M) in each string, the program effectively calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters, which is the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
