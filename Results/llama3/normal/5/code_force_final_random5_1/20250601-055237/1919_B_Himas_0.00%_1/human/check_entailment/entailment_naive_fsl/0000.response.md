Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. However, the program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

For example, consider the input string "++--". The program will output 0, but the correct output should be 4, because the optimal way to split the array is into two subarrays: [1, 1] and [-1, -1], and the penalty for each subarray is 2, so the total penalty is 4.

The program does not consider the length of the subarrays and the absolute value of their sums, which are important factors in calculating the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
