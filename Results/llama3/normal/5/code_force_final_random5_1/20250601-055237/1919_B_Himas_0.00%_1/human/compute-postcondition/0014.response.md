Output State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 0, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is either 2 or 1 and `M` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 3 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `M` can be either 1 or 2. If `q` is not '+', then `M` can be either 3 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
