Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input, `i` is equal to the length of `e` plus 2, `q` is the second character in `e`, `n` is greater than the length of `e` plus 2, `P` is 0, `M` is 2 if `q` is '+' otherwise `M` is 1, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `M` is now 2, otherwise, it remains 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
