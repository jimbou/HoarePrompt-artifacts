Output State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 0, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is either 3 or 2 and `M` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` can be either 3 or 2, because it was either 2 or 1 before the increment. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1, because it was 0 before the increment. The values of the other variables remain the same.
