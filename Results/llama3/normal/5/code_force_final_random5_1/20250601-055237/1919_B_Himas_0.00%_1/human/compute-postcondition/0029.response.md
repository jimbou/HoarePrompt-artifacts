Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input and has at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input, `q` is the second character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `M` is now 1. Otherwise, `M` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
