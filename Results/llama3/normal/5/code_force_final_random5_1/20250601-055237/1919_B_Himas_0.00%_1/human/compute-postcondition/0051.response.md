Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input with at least one more character, `i` is equal to the length of `e` plus 2, `q` is the third character in `e`, `n` is greater than the length of `e` plus 2, `P` is increased by 1, `M` remains the same as its value depends on `q` which is now the third character in `e`, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `M` is still dependent on `q`, which is the third character in `e`. The stdin still contains at least one fewer lines of input.
