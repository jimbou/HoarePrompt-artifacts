Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input with at least one more character, `i` is equal to the length of `e` plus 2, `q` is the third character in `e`, `n` is greater than the length of `e` plus 2, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', `P` is increased by 1 and `M` remains the same. Otherwise, `M` is increased by 1 and `P` remains the same.***
