Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the number of '+' characters (P) and '-' characters (M) in the input string and prints the difference between P and M. This is incorrect because the problem requires calculating the penalty for each subarray and summing them up, not just calculating the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The correct approach would be to iterate through the string and calculate the sum of each subarray. If the sum is positive, add it to the total penalty. If the sum is negative, subtract it from the total penalty. This way, the program would correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **False**
