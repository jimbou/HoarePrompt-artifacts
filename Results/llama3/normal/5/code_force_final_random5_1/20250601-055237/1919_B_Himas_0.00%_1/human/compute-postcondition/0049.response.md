Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input, `i` is equal to the length of `e` plus 2, `q` is the second character in `e`, `n` is greater than the length of `e` plus 2, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1 if `q` is not '+' and `P` is 0 and `M` is 2 if `q` is '+'***
