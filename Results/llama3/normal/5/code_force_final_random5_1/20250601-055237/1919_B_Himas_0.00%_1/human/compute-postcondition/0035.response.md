Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input, `i` is equal to the length of `e`, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input, `q` is the last character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in `e` and `M` is equal to the number of non-'+' characters in `e`. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in `e` and `M` is equal to the number of non-'+' characters in `e` plus one.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `s` remains unchanged, `e` remains the same string, `i` is now equal to the length of the string `e`, and `stdin` still contains at least one fewer lines of input. The variable `q` is now the last character in the string `e`. The values of `P` and `M` depend on the last character in `e`. If the last character is '+', then `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e` and `M` is the total count of non-'+' characters in `e`. If the last character is not '+', then `P` is still the total count of '+' characters in `e`, but `M` is the total count of non-'+' characters in `e` plus one.
