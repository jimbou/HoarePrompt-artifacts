Output State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 0, `q` is the second character in the string `e`, `P` is either 2 or 1, `M` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 2 and `M` is still 0. Otherwise, `P` is now 1 and `M` is still 1. The values of the other variables, including `s`, `e`, `i`, and `q`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least two fewer lines of input.
