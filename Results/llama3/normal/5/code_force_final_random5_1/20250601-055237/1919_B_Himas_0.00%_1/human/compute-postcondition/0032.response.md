Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input and has at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input, `q` is the third character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 3, otherwise, it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
