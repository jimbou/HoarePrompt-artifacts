The code prints the difference between the number of '+' characters in the string `e` and the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

Since `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e` and `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+', the expression `P - M` calculates the difference between these two counts.

Output: **the difference between the number of '+' characters in e and the number of characters in e that are not '+'**
