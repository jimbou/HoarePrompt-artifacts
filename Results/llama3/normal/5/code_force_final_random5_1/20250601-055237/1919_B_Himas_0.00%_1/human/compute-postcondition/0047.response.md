Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input, `i` is equal to the length of `e` plus 2, `q` is the second character in `e`, `n` is greater than the length of `e` plus 2, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 2, and `M` remains 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1, and `M` remains 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
