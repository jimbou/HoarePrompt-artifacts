Output: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input, `i` is equal to the length of `e`, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input, `q` is the last character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in `e` and `M` is equal to the number of non-'+' characters in `e`. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in `e` and `M` is equal to the number of non-'+' characters in `e` plus one, and the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in `e` is being printed, which is P - M**
