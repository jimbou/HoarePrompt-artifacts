To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

The loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`. Since each test case consists of two lines, we need at least two lines of input for the loop to execute once.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`stdin` contains at least two lines of input, `i` is 0**

Note that we don't need to specify the exact contents of the input lines, as the loop will execute as long as there is input to read. The loop body will then process the input accordingly.
