Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 0, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is either 3 or 2 and `M` is either 0 or 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is either 1 or 0 and `M` is either 3 or 2.***
