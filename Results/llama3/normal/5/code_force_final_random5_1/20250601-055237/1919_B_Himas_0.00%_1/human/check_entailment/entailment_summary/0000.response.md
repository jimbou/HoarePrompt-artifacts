Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty. The program iterates over each character in the input string, incrementing the count of '+' characters (P) and '-' characters (M) accordingly. Finally, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the arrays are split such that the sum of each subarray is either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. By splitting the arrays in this way, the program minimizes the total penalty.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading multiple test cases from standard input and printing the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
