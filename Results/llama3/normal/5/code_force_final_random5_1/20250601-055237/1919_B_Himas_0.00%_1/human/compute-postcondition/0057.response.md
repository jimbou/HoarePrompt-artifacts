Output State: **i equals the number of test cases, stdin is empty, s is the last input, e is the last string of '+' and '-' characters, P is the number of '+' characters in the last string, M is the number of '-' characters in the last string, and the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the last string is being printed, which is P - M.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the number of test cases, the standard input `stdin` will be empty because all the input lines will have been read, `s` will be the last input integer, `e` will be the last string of '+' and '-' characters, `P` will be the number of '+' characters in the last string, and `M` will be the number of '-' characters in the last string. The difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the last string, which is `P - M`, will be printed.
