Output State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input and has at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input, `q` is the third character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` remains the same as the first input, `e` is still a non-empty string with at least 3 characters and is equal to the second input, `i` is still 2, and `stdin` still contains at least one fewer lines of input. The value of `q` is still the third character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` has been incremented by 1 to 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` has been incremented by 1 to 3.
