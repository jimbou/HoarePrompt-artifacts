Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-".
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(P - M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is an integer, `e` is a string, `i` is 0, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+', stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input, and the difference between the number of '+' characters in `e` and the number of characters in `e` that are not '+' is being printed, which is P - M

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input, `i` is equal to the length of `e`, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input, `q` is the last character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in `e` and `M` is equal to the number of non-'+' characters in `e`. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in `e` and `M` is equal to the number of non-'+' characters in `e` plus one, and the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in `e` is being printed, which is P - M

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: s is an integer equal to the first input, e is a non-empty string equal to the second input, i is equal to the length of e plus 1, q is the last character in e, n is greater than the length of e plus 1, stdin contains at least one fewer lines of input. P is equal to the number of '+' characters in e and M is equal to the number of characters in e that are not '+'. The difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in e is being printed, which is P - M.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
