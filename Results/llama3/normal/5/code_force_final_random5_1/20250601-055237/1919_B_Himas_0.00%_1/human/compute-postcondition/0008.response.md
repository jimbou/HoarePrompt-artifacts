The only objects in the loop head are variables  q and e, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string e.  If the string has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, e has at least 1 character, q is the first character in the string e, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 2 characters and the q is the second character in the string e.
State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 0, `q` is the second character in the string `e`, stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
