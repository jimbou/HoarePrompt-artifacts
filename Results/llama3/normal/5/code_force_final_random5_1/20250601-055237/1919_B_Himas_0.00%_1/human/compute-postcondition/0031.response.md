According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If `e` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `e` has at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in `e`, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `e` must have at least 3 characters and the character `q` is the third character in `e`. Also, `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2.
State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input and has at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input, `q` is the third character in `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
