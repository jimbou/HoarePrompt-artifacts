Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 0, `q` is the second character in the string `e`, stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is either 2 or 1 and `M` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 1.***
