To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `e`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `e`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `e` plus 1, and `q` is the first character in `e`. For the loop to execute again, `q` should be the next character in `e`, and `i` should be incremented by 1.

Since `e` is a non-empty string, it must have at least two characters. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `q` should be the second character in `e`, and `i` should be equal to the length of `e` plus 2.

The other variables, `s`, `n`, `P`, and `M`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input, `i` is equal to the length of `e` plus 2, `q` is the second character in `e`, `n` is greater than the length of `e` plus 2, `stdin` contains at least one fewer lines of input. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
