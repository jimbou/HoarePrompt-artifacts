Output State: **`s` is an integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is the first character in the string `e` and equals '+', stdin contains at least two fewer lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The string `e` still has at least 1 character, and `q` is still the first character in the string `e` and equals '+'. The stdin still contains at least two fewer lines of input.
