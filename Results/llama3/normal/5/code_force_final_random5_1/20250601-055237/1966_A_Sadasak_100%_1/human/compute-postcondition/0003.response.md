Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value greater than `k`, `num` is the first integer in the list and its current value in the `frequency_table` is greater than `k`.**
