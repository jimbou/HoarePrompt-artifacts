The value of `frequency_table[num]` is updated to `k`. The value of `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`, and its current value in the `frequency_table` is greater than `k`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value equal to `k`, `num` is the first integer in the list and its current value in the `frequency_table` is equal to `k`.**
