The only object in the loop head is variable  num and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the num is the third integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the first integer in the `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is either equal to `k` if the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, or the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus 1, or 1 if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.**
