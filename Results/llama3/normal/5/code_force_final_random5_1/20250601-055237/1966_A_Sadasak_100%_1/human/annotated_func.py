#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each integer in `arr` is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the integer in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the last integer in the list. If the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is either the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, or the number of times `num` appears in `arr` if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each integer in the list `arr` is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the integer in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged. Specifically, the value of the last integer `num` in the list is either `k` if its original value in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, or the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, or the number of times `num` appears in `arr` if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, limiting the count of each integer to a specified maximum value k. It returns a dictionary where each integer in the list is a key, and its corresponding value is either the actual frequency of the integer in the list or the maximum value k, whichever is smaller.
