Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each integer in `arr` is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the integer in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the last integer in the list. If the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is either the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, or the number of times `num` appears in `arr` if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the frequency table will contain the frequency of each integer in the array, but capped at the value of `k`. If an integer appears more than `k` times in the array, its frequency in the table will be `k`. If an integer appears less than or equal to `k` times, its frequency in the table will be its actual frequency in the array. The array and the value of `k` remain unchanged.
