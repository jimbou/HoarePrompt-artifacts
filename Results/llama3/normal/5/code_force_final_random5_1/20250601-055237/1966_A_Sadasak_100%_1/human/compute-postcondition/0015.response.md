Output State: **The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each integer in the list `arr` is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the integer in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged. Specifically, the value of the last integer `num` in the list is either `k` if its original value in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, or the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, or the number of times `num` appears in `arr` if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.**
