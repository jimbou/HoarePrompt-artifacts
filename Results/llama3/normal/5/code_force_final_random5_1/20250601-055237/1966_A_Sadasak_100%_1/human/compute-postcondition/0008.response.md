Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the first integer in the `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the second integer in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is now equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated to `k`, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has at least 2 integers, `k` is still an integer between 2 and 100, and the `frequency_table` still has the first integer in the list as a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value was larger than `k`, or remains unchanged otherwise. The value of `num` is still the second integer in the list.
