Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the first integer in the `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the third integer in the list. If the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is either the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus 2, or 2 if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.***
