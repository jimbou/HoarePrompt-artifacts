Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value of 1, `num` is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the code has updated the `frequency_table` dictionary by adding the first integer in the list (`num`) as a key with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `arr` is still between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is still an integer between 2 and 100. The value of `num` is still the first integer in the list.
