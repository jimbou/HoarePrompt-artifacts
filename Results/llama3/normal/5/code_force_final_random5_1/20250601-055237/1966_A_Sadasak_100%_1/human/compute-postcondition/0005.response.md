Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the first integer in the `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged. `num` is the first integer in the list.***
