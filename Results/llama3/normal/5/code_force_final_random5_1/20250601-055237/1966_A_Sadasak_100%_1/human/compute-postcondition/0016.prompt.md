You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each integer in `arr` is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the integer in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the last integer in the list. If the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is either the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, or the number of times `num` appears in `arr` if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each integer in the list `arr` is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the integer in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged. Specifically, the value of the last integer `num` in the list is either `k` if its original value in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, or the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, or the number of times `num` appears in `arr` if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each integer in the list `arr` is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the integer in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged. Specifically, the value of the last integer `num` in the list is either `k` if its original value in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, or the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, or the number of times `num` appears in `arr` if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
