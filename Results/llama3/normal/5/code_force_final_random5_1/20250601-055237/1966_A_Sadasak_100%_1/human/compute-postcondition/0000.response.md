Output State: **arr is a list of integers, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), frequency_table is an empty dictionary**

In this output state, the values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The length of `arr` is still between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is still an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). A new variable `frequency_table` is introduced, which is an empty dictionary.
