Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the first integer in the `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the second integer in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is either equal to `k` if the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, or the original value of `num` in `frequency_table` plus 1, or 1 if `num` was not in `frequency_table` before.***
