Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list is a key with a value equal to `k` if the original value of the first integer in the `frequency_table` is larger than `k`. Otherwise, the `frequency_table` remains unchanged, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`**.

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated to `k`, regardless of its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has at least 3 integers, `k` is still an integer between 2 and 100, and the first integer in the list is still a key in the `frequency_table` with a value equal to `k` if its original value was larger than `k`. The value of `num` is still the third integer in the list.
