According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, arr is a list of integers, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), frequency_table is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first integer in the list**
