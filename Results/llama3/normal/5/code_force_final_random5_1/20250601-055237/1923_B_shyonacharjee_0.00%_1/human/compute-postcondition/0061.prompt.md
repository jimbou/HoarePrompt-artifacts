Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, healths is a list of integers from the second input, positions is a list of integers from the third input, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, t is greater than 1, _ is 2, i is n-1, position is the position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, bullets_needed is the health of the last monster, total_bullets_used is 0, and success is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `healths` is a list of integers from the second input, `positions` is a list of integers from the third input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `total_bullets_used` is the health of the last monster, and if the total bullets used plus the bullets needed is greater than the time available, then `success` is False. Otherwise, `success` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `healths` is a list of integers from the second input, `positions` is a list of integers from the third input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health of the last monster and the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, and `success` is False if the sum of the total bullets used and the bullets needed is greater than the time available, otherwise `success` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `healths` is a list of integers from the second input, `positions` is a list of integers from the third input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health of the last monster, the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, and the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, and `success` is False if the sum of the total bullets used and the bullets needed is greater than the time available, otherwise `success` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
