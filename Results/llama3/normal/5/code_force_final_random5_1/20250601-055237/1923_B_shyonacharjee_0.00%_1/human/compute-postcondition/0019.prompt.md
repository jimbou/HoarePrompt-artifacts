Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, total_bullets_used is 0, success is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the health of the first monster, `success` is False if the health of the first monster > time_available, otherwise `success` is True, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the first monster, `health` is the health of the first monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the first monster.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the health of the first monster plus the health of the monster at index `i`, `success` is False if the total bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available, otherwise `success` is True, `i` is 1, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the health of the first monster plus the health of the monster at index i plus the health of the monster at index i, `i` is 2, `position` is the position of the monster at index i in the monsters list, `health` is the health of the monster at index i in the monsters list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index i. If the health of the first monster plus the health of the monster at index i plus the health of the monster at index i is larger than the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, then `success` is False. Otherwise, `success` is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
