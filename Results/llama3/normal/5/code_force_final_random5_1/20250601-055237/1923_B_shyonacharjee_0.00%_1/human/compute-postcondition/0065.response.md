Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to defeat a series of monsters with a limited number of bullets. It takes as input the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of monsters, the maximum number of bullets that can be used, the health of each monster, and the position of each monster. It then simulates the battle, using the minimum number of bullets necessary to defeat each monster, and checks if the total number of bullets used exceeds the maximum allowed. If it does, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to defeat all monsters. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
