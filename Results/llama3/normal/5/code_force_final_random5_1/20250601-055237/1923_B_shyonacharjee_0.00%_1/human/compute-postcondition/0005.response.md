Postcondition: **t is 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty, n is at least 1, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, total_bullets_used is 0, success is True, i is 0, position is the position of the first monster, health is the health of the first monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, bullets_needed is the health of the first monster. The current value of total_bullets_used plus bullets_needed is greater than time_available.**
