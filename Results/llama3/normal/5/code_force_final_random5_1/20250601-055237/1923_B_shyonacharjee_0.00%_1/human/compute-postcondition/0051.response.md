State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `healths` is a list of integers from the second input, `positions` is a list of integers from the third input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `total_bullets_used` is the health of the last monster, and if the total bullets used plus the bullets needed is greater than the time available, then `success` is False. Otherwise, `success` is True.**
