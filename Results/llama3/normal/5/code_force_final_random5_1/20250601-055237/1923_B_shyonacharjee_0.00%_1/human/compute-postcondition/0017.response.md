Postcondition: ***t is 1, _ is 0, n is at least 3, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, total_bullets_used is equal to the health of the first monster plus the health of the monster at index i, i is 2, position is the position of the monster at index i in the monsters list, health is the health of the monster at index i in the monsters list, distance is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, bullets_needed is the health of the monster at index i. If total_bullets_used plus bullets_needed is larger than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, success is True.***
