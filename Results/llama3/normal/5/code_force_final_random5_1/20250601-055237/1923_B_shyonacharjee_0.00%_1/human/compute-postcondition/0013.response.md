Output State: **`t` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the health of the first monster plus the health of the monster at index `i`, `success` is False if the total bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available, otherwise `success` is True, `i` is 1, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total_bullets_used` has been updated to include the bullets needed for the current monster. All other variables remain unchanged. The success status is still dependent on whether the total bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available.
