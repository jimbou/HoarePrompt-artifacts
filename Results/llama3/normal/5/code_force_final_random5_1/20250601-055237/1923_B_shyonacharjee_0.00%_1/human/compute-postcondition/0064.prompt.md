Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n <= n; x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
    positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    total_bullets_used = 0
    success = True
    for i in range(n):
        position, health = monsters[i]
        distance = abs(position)
        time_available = distance
        bullets_needed = health
        if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
            success = False
            break
        total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
    print('YES' if success else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the health of all monsters, `success` is False if the total bullets used exceeds the time available for any monster, otherwise `success` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, and 'YES' is printed if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, healths is a list of integers from the second input, positions is a list of integers from the third input, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, t is 1, _ is 1, i is n-1, position is the position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, bullets_needed is the health of the last monster, total_bullets_used is increased by bullets_needed, and success is False if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available, otherwise success remains unchanged, and 'YES' is printed if success is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, healths is a list of integers from the second input, positions is a list of integers from the third input, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, t is greater than 1, _ is 2, i is n, position is the position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, bullets_needed is the health of the last monster, total_bullets_used is the sum of the health of all monsters, and success is False if the sum of the total bullets used and the bullets needed is greater than the time available, otherwise success remains True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether success is True or False, where 'YES' means the sum of the total bullets used and the bullets needed is less than or equal to the time available, and 'NO' means the sum of the total bullets used and the bullets needed is greater than the time available




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
