Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `healths` is a list of integers from the second input, `positions` is a list of integers from the third input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health of the last monster and the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`, and `success` is False if the sum of the total bullets used and the bullets needed is greater than the time available, otherwise `success` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `healths`, `positions`, `monsters`, `t`, `_`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `total_bullets_used` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (which was the health of the last monster) and the health of the monster at index `i` in `monsters`. The value of `success` is also updated based on the new value of `total_bullets_used` and the time available.
