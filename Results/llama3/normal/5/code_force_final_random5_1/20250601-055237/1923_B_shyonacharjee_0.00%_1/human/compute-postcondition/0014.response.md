The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the health of the first monster plus the health of the monster at index `i`, `success` is False if the total bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available, otherwise `success` is True, `i` is 2, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i`.**
