Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `healths` is a list of integers from the second input, `positions` is a list of integers from the third input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers from the second and third inputs, `t` is 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the values of `success` and other variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `healths`, `positions`, `monsters`, `t`, `_`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `total_bullets_used` is increased by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is equal to the health of the last monster. If the new value of `total_bullets_used` plus `bullets_needed` exceeds the value of `time_available`, which is equal to the absolute value of the position of the last monster, then `success` is set to False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the value of `success` remains unchanged.
