Reasoning:

The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly calculates the cumulative sum of digits for each integer from 1 to 200000 and stores it in the `values` list.
2.  It then reads a sequence of integers from standard input, representing the test cases.
3.  For each test case, it prints the cumulative sum of digits for the given integer, which is the desired output.

The program's approach is efficient, as it precalculates the cumulative sum of digits for all integers up to 200000 and stores them in the `values` list. This allows it to quickly look up the cumulative sum of digits for each input integer, making it suitable for the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
