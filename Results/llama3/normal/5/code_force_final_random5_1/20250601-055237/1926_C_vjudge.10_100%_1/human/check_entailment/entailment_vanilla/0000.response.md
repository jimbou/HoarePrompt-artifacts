Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first defines a function `func_1()` that contains the entire logic of the program. This function is called at the beginning of the program.

2. Inside `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `values` of size `2 * 10^5 + 1` with all elements set to 0. This list is used to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `2 * 10^5`.

3. The program then iterates over the range from 1 to `2 * 10^5` (inclusive). For each number `i` in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting `i` to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting the character back to an integer, and adding it to the sum. This sum is then added to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i - 1]`, and the result is stored in `values[i]`.

4. After calculating the cumulative sums for all numbers up to `2 * 10^5`, the program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.

5. For each test case, the program reads an integer `value` from the input and prints the cumulative sum stored in `values[value]`, which represents the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Correctness: **True**
