According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits plus one, so it must have at least `t + 1` digits. Also, `x` is the last digit of `i`, so it must be a digit of `i`.

State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `t + 1` digits, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` is a digit of `i`**
