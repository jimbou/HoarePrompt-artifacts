According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `inf`. If `inf` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `inf` is 200001, which is greater than 1, so the loop can execute. `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 1. So, `i` must be 1 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**
