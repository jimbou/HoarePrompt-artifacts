Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` is the last digit of `i`**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` is still a sequence of integers, and the other variables maintain their previous values and relationships.
