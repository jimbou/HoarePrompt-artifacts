Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is an integer with at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the first two digits of `i` and its previous value plus the second digit of `i`, `x` is the second digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated by adding the second digit of `i` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
