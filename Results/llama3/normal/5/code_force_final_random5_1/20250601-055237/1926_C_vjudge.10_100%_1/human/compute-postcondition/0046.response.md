Output State: **`inf` is 200001, `t` is 0, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is an integer input from stdin, stdin contains no input, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and `value` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from stdin, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `t` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `values` list remains unchanged, still containing the sum of all digits of each integer from 1 to 200001, plus the sum of all digits of each integer from the previous iterations, plus the value at the previous index in the `values` list. The `sum_value_digits` variable still holds the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, where `x` is the last digit of `i`. The `value` variable is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from stdin, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed. The stdin contains no input, indicating that all inputs have been processed.
