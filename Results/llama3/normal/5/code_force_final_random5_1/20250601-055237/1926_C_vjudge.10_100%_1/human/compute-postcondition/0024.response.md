Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits plus one, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` is the last digit of `i`**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still the last digit of `i`, and `i` still has at least `t` digits plus one. The list `values` remains the same, with each element being the sum of all digits of its index plus the sum of all digits of its index from previous iterations plus the previous element. The input in `stdin` is still a sequence of integers.
