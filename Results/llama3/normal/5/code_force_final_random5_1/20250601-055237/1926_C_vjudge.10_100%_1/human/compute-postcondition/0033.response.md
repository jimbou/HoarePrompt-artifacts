Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `values` list contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `inf` (200001), where each element `values[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` plus the sum of the digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus the previous value `values[i - 1]`. The variable `i` has reached its maximum value of `inf` digits, and `sum_value_digits` has accumulated the sum of the digits of all integers up to `i`. The variable `x` is the last digit of the last integer `i`.
