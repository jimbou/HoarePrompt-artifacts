You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^4) and then a sequence of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5).
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: `stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: `inf` is 200001, `t` is 0, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is an integer input from stdin, stdin contains no input, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and `value` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from stdin, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: `inf` is 200001, `t` is 0, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is an integer input from stdin, stdin contains no input, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and `value` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from stdin, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
