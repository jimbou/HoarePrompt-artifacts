Output State: `stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the second digit of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` will have at least `t` digits, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The variable `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of all digits of `i` plus the second digit of `i`. The variable `x` will be the last digit of `i`. The other variables, `stdin`, `inf`, and `values`, remain unchanged.
