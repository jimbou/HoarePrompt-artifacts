The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least 1 digit the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `sum_value_digits` is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `i` must have at least 1 digit and the variable `x` is the first digit of `i`.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is an integer with at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` is the first digit of `i`**
