The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` adds the integer value of `x` to `sum_value_digits`. The value of `x` is the third digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the first two digits of `i` and its previous value plus the second digit of `i`. 

Since `i` is an integer with at least 3 digits, we can represent it as `i = 100a + 10b + c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the first, second, and third digits of `i`, respectively. 

Then, `sum_value_digits` is initially `a + b + b = a + 2b`, and `x` is `c`. 

After the code is executed, `sum_value_digits` becomes `a + 2b + c`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is an integer with at least 3 digits, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the second digit of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`.**
