The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `inf`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. Since `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits, increasing it by 1 will result in an integer with at least `t` digits as well.

State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations, `x` is the last digit of `i`**
