Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, inf is 200001, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), values is a list of 200001 zeros**

The code starts by defining a variable `inf` and assigning it the value of `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`, which is 200001. This value is used to initialize a list `values` with 200001 zeros.

The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since stdin initially contains two inputs, after reading the first integer, stdin is left with a sequence of integers.

The third line initializes a list `values` with 200001 zeros. This list is not modified further in the given code snippet.

Therefore, after executing the entire code block, the final state is as follows: `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, and stdin contains a sequence of integers.
