Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    value = int(input())
    print(values[value])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `inf` is 200001, `t` is at least 1, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is the input sequence of integers, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed, which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `inf` is 200001, `t` is at least 2, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is an integer input from stdin, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed, which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]`, stdin contains no input, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `inf` is 200001, `t` is at least 3, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is an integer input from stdin, stdin contains no input, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and `value` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from stdin, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
