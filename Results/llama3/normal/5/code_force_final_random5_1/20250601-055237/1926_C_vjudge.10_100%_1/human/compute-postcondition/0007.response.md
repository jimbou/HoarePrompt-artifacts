To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for x in str(i):`, which means the loop will iterate over each character (digit) in the string representation of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer with at least 2 digits.

To execute the loop again, `i` must have at least one more digit. Since `x` is the second digit of `i`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least 3 digits.

The other variables in the state (`stdin`, `inf`, `t`, `values`, `sum_value_digits`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is an integer with at least 3 digits, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the first two digits of `i` and its previous value plus the second digit of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`**
