To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `i`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the digits of the string representation of `i`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another digit in the string representation of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer with at least `t + 1` digits. For the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least one more digit.

The state of `x` is also adjusted, as it is the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

The other variables, `stdin`, `inf`, `t`, `values`, and `sum_value_digits`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `t + 2` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits`, `x` is the next digit of `i`.**
