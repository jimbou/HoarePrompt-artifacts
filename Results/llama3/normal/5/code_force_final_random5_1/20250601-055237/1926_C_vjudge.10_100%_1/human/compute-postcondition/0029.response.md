The only object in the loop head is variable  x and string i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string i.  If the string has at least 2 digits the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, i has at least t + 2 digits, x is the next digit of i. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string i must have at least t + 2 digits and the x is the next digit of i.
State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `t + 2` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the next digit of `i`.**
