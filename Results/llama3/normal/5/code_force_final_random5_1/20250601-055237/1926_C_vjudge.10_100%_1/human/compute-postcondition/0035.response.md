Output State: **`inf` is 200001, `t` is at least 1, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is the input sequence of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `value` has been updated to the input sequence of integers from `stdin`, which now contains no inputs. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships.
