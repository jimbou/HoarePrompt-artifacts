Output: **`inf` is 200001, `t` is at least 1, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is the input sequence of integers, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed, which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]`.**
