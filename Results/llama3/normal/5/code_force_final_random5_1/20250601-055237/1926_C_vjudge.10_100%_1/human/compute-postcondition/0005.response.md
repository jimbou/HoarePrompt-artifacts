To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for x in str(i):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `x` and `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer with at least 1 digit. For the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least one more digit. Since `x` is the first digit of `i`, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be the next digit of `i`.

State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is an integer with at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the first two digits of `i` and its previous value, `x` is the second digit of `i`.**
