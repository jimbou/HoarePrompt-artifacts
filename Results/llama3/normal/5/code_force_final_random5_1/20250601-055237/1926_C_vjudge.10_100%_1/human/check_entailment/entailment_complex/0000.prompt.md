Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than 0 and less or equal than 10^4) and then a sequence of integers (each greater than 0 and less or equal than 2*10^5).
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: `stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: `inf` is 200001, `t` is 0, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `inf` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` of `i` and the previous value of `sum_value_digits` plus the digit `x` of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `value` is an integer input from stdin, stdin contains no input, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and `value` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from stdin, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the sum of all digits of `value` from the previous iterations plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, calculates the cumulative sum of digits for each integer from 1 to 200000, and then prints the cumulative sum of digits for each input integer. The function does not return any value but prints the results to standard output.
