Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.**

The output state is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `i`, `sum_value_digits`, and `x`. The loop iterates over the digits of `i`, and in each iteration, it adds the current digit to `sum_value_digits`. After the loop finishes, `sum_value_digits` will be equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `x` will be the last digit of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
