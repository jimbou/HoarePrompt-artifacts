Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is an integer with at least `t` digits, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations, `x` is the last digit of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` has at least `t` digits, and `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations. The value of `x` is the last digit of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
