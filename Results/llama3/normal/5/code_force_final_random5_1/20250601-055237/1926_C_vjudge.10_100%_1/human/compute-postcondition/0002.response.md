Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of integers as input. The variable `inf` still holds the value 200001, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is still a list of 200001 zeros, and `i` is still 1.
