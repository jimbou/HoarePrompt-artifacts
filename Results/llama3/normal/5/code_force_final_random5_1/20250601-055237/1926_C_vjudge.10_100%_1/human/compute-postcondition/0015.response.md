Output State: **`stdin` contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, `inf` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`, `i` is an integer with at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the first digit of `i`, `x` is the first digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to be equal to the first digit of `i`, which is also the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
