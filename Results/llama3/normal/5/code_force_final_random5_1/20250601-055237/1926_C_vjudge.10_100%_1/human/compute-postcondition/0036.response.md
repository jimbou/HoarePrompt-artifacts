Based on the initial state, we can determine what will be printed when the statement executes.

The `values` list contains 200001 integers, where each integer at index `i` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the sum of all digits of `i` from the previous iterations plus `values[i - 1]`. This means that each element in the `values` list is a cumulative sum of digit sums.

The `value` variable is an input sequence of integers, but its exact value is not specified. However, we know that `i` is an integer with at least `inf` (200001) digits.

When we print `values[value]`, we are accessing the element in the `values` list at the index specified by `value`. Since `value` is an input sequence of integers, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the `values` list.

Output: **the cumulative sum of digit sums of the integer at index [value] in the values list, where [value] is the input sequence of integers**
