Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description states that the goal is to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed simultaneously, such that each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is used in more than one polygon. However, the program only considers the count of sticks of each length and divides it by 3 to find the maximum number of polygons that can be formed. This approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual number of polygons that can be formed with the available sticks.

For example, consider the input:

3
1 1 1

The program will output 1, but the correct answer is 0 because it is not possible to form a polygon with only three sticks of length 1.

The program needs to be modified to correctly count the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed with the available sticks.
