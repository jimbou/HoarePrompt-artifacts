Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by the integer division of all values in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `x` is the last value in `cnt`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state will have the same characteristics as the initial state, except for the variable `ans`, which will be increased by the sum of the integer divisions of all values in the dictionary `cnt` by 3. The loop will iterate over all values in `cnt`, adding the result of the integer division of each value by 3 to `ans`. The other variables, `n`, `a`, `cnt`, `stdin`, and `x`, will remain unchanged.
