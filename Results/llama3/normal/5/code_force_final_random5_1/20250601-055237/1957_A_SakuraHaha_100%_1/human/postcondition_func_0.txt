This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the sum of the integer divisions of the frequencies of all integers in the list by 3. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, only printing the result. The function reads the first line of stdin as an integer t, then reads t blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n followed by n integers. It counts the frequency of each integer in the list, calculates the sum of the integer divisions of these frequencies by 3, and prints this sum. The function does not modify the input variables.
