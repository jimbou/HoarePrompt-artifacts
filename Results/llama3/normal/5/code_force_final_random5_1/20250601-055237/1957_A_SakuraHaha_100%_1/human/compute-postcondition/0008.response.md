The only object in the loop head is variable x and cnt, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cnt. If cnt has at least 1 value the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, ans is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the cnt must have at least 1 value and the x is the first value in the cnt.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list a and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), x is the first value in the cnt, cnt must have at least 1 value**
