The only object in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cnt dictionary.  If the dictionary has at least 2 values the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, cnt is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, x is the first value in `cnt`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 2 values and the x is the second value in `cnt`.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by the integer division of the second value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `x` is the second value in `cnt`.**
