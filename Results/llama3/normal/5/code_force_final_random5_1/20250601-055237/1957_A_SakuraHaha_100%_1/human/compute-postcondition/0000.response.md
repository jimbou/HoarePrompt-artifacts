Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

Explanation: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to `a`. The third line initializes `ans` to 0. The fourth line initializes `cnt` as an empty dictionary. After executing these lines, `n` and `a` have been assigned values, `ans` is 0, and `cnt` is empty. The stdin now contains `t-1` blocks of 2 lines, as one block has been read and processed.
