Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list a and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), x is the last integer in the list.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by the integer division of the first value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `x` is the first value in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by the integer division of the second value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `x` is the second value in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by the integer division of the third value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `x` is the third value in `cnt`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
