Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `a` and the value is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `x` is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to include the first integer in the list `a` as a key with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).
