Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `a` and the value is 1, the key is the second integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, the key is the third integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list plus one, `stdin` contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `x` is the third integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been updated to be the number of times `x` appears in the list `a` plus one. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).
