Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by the integer division of the third value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `x` is the third value in `cnt`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `ans` has been increased by the integer division of the third value in `cnt` by 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
