Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list a and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), x is the last integer in the list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100, the list `a` remains a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` remains 0, and `stdin` remains unchanged. The dictionary `cnt` now contains each integer in the list `a` as keys and the number of times each integer appears in the list as values. The variable `x` is the last integer in the list `a`.
