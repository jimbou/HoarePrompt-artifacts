#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+2t lines, where t is an integer (1 <= t <= 100). The first line contains t. Each of the following t blocks of 2 lines contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list a and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains t-1 blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), x is the last integer in the list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by the integer division of all values in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is each integer in the list `a` and the value is the number of times it appears in the list, stdin contains `t-1` blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `x` is the last value in `cnt`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of the frequencies of all integers in the list `a` by 3

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the sum of the integer divisions of the frequencies of all integers in the list by 3. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, only printing the result. The function reads the first line of stdin as an integer t, then reads t blocks of 2 lines, where each block contains an integer n followed by n integers. It counts the frequency of each integer in the list, calculates the sum of the integer divisions of these frequencies by 3, and prints this sum. The function does not modify the input variables.
