To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for n in arr:`, which means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `arr`. The current state is:

* `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer
* `freq` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1
* `n` is the first integer in the list

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `n` and `arr`.

Since `n` is the first integer in the list, for the loop to execute again, `n` should be the second integer in the list. Also, `arr` should have at least 2 integers.

The state of `freq` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `freq` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1, `n` is the second integer in the list**
