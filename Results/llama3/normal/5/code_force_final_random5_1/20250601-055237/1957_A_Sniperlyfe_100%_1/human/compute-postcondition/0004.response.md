The code `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` updates the frequency of the second integer `n` in the dictionary `freq`. If `n` is already a key in `freq`, its frequency is incremented by 1. If `n` is not a key in `freq`, it is added with a frequency of 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `freq` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1, and the second integer `n` in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1 or more, `n` is the second integer in the list**
