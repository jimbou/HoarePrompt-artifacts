The only variable in the loop head is variable  n and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 integers, n is the second integer in the list, freq is a dictionary with the first integer in arr as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1, and the second integer n in arr as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1 or more. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the n is the third integer in the list and freq is a dictionary with the first integer in arr as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1, the second integer in arr as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1 or more, and the third integer in arr as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `freq` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1, the second integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1 or more, and the third integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1, `n` is the third integer in the list**
