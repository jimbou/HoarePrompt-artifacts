Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, `n` is the last integer in the list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be a list of integers (`arr`) and a dictionary (`freq`) where each key is an integer from the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the list. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last integer in the list.
