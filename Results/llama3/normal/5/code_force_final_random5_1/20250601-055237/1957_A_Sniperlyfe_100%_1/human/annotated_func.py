#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, `n` is the last integer in the list.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the list `arr` by 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the total number of sets of three sticks of the same length that can be formed from a given list of stick lengths. The function takes a list of integers representing stick lengths as input, counts the frequency of each length, and then returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, effectively counting the number of complete sets of three sticks of the same length.
