Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. The variable `freq` is assigned an empty dictionary, which means it is initialized but does not contain any key-value pairs.
