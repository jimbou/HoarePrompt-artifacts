Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `freq` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1, the second integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1 or more, the third integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 2, `n` is the third integer in the list**

In this output state, the frequency of the third integer in the list `arr` has been incremented by 1 in the dictionary `freq`, while the frequencies of the first and second integers remain unchanged. The list `arr` and the value of `n` remain the same as in the initial state.
