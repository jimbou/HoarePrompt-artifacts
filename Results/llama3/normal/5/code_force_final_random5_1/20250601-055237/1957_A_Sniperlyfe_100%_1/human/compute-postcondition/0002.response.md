The code `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` updates the frequency of the integer `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Since `n` is the first integer in the list `arr`, its value is already known. The `get` method returns the current frequency of `n` in the dictionary, or 0 if `n` is not yet in the dictionary. This value is then incremented by 1 and stored back in the dictionary.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `freq` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key and its frequency as the value, which is 1, `n` is the first integer in the list.**
