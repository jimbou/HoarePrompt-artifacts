To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `_` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, its new value will be 1.

State: **`test_cases` is a returned value of `func_1()` that must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and the function `func_6()` has been executed.**
