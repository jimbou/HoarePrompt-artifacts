Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5) and m is at least m, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with 2*m edges (u, v) and (v, u), edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class representing a disjoint-set data structure with n+1 elements, _min_edge is a float representing the minimum edge weight, node_u and node_v are integers representing the vertices of the minimum edge, colors is a list of integers representing the colors of the vertices, and res is a list of integers representing the result of the depth-first search.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the program maintains its initial state, with `n` being an integer between 3 and `m`, `m` being an integer between `n` and the minimum of `n*(n-1)/2` and `2*10^5`, `i` being `m-1`, `graph` being a dictionary with `2*m` edges, `edges` being an empty list, `dsu` being a disjoint-set data structure with `n+1` elements, `colors` being a list of integers, `res` being a list of integers, and `_min_edge` being the minimum edge weight. The vertices `u` and `v` are in the same set, and the minimum edge weight and the vertices of the minimum edge are updated accordingly.
