This function takes no arguments and returns no values. It constructs an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges, finds the minimum edge weight, and performs a depth-first search starting from one of the vertices of the minimum edge. The function then prints the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes visited during the depth-first search, followed by the nodes visited in the depth-first search.
