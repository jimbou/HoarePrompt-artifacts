Postcondition: ***`curr` is a node in the graph, `parent` is the parent node of `curr` in the current DFS path, `path` is the current DFS path with `curr` appended, `colors` is a list of colors (0, 1, or 2) for each node in the graph with the color of `curr` changed to 1, `graph` is an adjacency list representation of the graph where `graph[curr]` has at least two neighbors, `node_v` is a node in the graph, and `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the list `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not the parent of `curr`, the program returns the result of the dfs function called with `nei`, `curr`, and `path` as arguments if the result is not empty and `node_v` is in the result. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
