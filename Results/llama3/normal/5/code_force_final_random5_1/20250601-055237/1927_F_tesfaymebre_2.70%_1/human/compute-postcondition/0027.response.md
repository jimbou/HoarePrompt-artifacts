Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and m, m is an integer between n and the minimum of n*(n-1)/2 and 2*10^5, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with 2*m edges, edges is a sorted list of tuples that must have at least 2 edges, dsu is a disjoint-set data structure with n+1 elements, colors is a list of integers, res is a list of integers, w is the weight of the third edge, parent_u is the parent of vertex u in the disjoint-set data structure, parent_v is the parent of vertex v in the disjoint-set data structure, u and v are the vertices of the third edge, and _min_edge is the minimum edge weight.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `colors`, `res`, `w`, `u`, `v`, and `_min_edge` remain unchanged. The only changes are the assignments of `parent_u` and `parent_v`, which are now set to the parents of vertices `u` and `v` in the disjoint-set data structure, respectively.
