Output State: **`test_cases` is a returned value of `func_1()` that must be greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `test_cases - 1`, and the function `func_6()` has been executed `test_cases` times.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` remains the same as it was before the loop started, the variable `_` has been incremented to `test_cases - 1`, and the function `func_6()` has been executed a total number of times equal to the value of `test_cases`.
