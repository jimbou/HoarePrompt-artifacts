Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5) and m is at least m, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with 2*m edges (u, v) and (v, u), edges is a sorted list in descending order containing m tuples (w, u, v), dsu is an instance of the DSU class representing a disjoint-set data structure with n+1 elements, _min_edge is a float representing the minimum edge weight and is set to positive infinity, node_u and node_v are integers representing the vertices of the minimum edge and are set to -1, colors is a list of integers representing the colors of the vertices, and res is a list of integers representing the result of the depth-first search.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5) and m is at least m, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with 2*m edges (u, v) and (v, u), edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 tuple (w, u, v), dsu is an instance of the DSU class representing a disjoint-set data structure with n+1 elements. If parent_u is equal to parent_v, then the parent of vertex u and vertex v is the same, if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] is less than the current _min_edge, then _min_edge is updated to dsu.min_edge[parent_u], node_u is set to u and node_v is set to v, otherwise, the values of _min_edge, node_u and node_v remain unchanged. If parent_u is not equal to parent_v, then u and v are now in the same set, _min_edge is a float representing the minimum edge weight and is set to positive infinity, node_u and node_v are integers representing the vertices of the minimum edge and are set to -1. colors is a list of integers representing the colors of the vertices, res is a list of integers representing the result of the depth-first search, w is the weight of the first edge, u is the first vertex of the first edge, v is the second vertex of the first edge, parent_u is the parent of vertex u in the disjoint-set data structure and is equal to parent_v which is the parent of vertex v in the disjoint-set data structure.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The program maintains its initial state, with `n` being an integer between 3 and `m`, `m` being an integer between `n` and the minimum of `n*(n-1)/2` and `2*10^5`, `i` being `m-1`, `graph` being a dictionary with `2*m` edges, `edges` being a sorted list of tuples, `dsu` being a disjoint-set data structure with `n+1` elements, `colors` being a list of integers, `res` being a list of integers, `w` being the weight of the second edge, `u` and `v` being the vertices of the second edge, and `_min_edge` being the minimum edge weight. If the parent of vertex `u` is the same as the parent of vertex `v`, then the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the parent of vertex `u` and vertex `v` is the same, and the program state remains unchanged. Additionally, if the minimum edge weight of the parent of vertex `u` is less than the current minimum edge weight, then `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum edge weight of the parent of vertex `u`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are updated to the vertices of the second edge.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 3 and m, m is an integer between n and the minimum of n*(n-1)/2 and 2*10^5, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with 2*m edges, edges is a sorted list of tuples that must have at least 2 edges, dsu is a disjoint-set data structure with n+1 elements where u and v are in the same set, colors is a list of integers, res is a list of integers, w is the weight of the third edge, parent_u is the parent of vertex u in the disjoint-set data structure which is the same as parent_v, parent_v is the parent of vertex v in the disjoint-set data structure which is the same as parent_u, u and v are the vertices of the third edge, and _min_edge is the minimum edge weight. If dsu.min_edge[parent_u] is less than _min_edge, then node_u is u and node_v is v.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
