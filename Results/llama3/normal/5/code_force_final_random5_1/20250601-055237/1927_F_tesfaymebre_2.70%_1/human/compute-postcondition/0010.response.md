Postcondition: ***`curr` is a node in the graph, `parent` is the parent node of `curr` in the current DFS path, `path` is the current DFS path with `curr` appended, `colors` is a list of colors (0, 1, or 2) for each node in the graph with the color of `curr` changed to 1, `graph` is an adjacency list representation of the graph where `graph[curr]` has at least one neighbor, and `node_v` is a node in the graph. If there exists a neighbor `nei` of `curr` such that `nei` is not the parent of `curr` and the color of `nei` is not 2, then `res` is the result of the DFS traversal starting from `nei` with `curr` as the parent, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. Either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.***
