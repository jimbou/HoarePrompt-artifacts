n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary representing an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the graph, where each tuple contains the weight and the two vertices of the edge, dsu is an instance of the DSU class representing a disjoint-set data structure, _min_edge is a float representing the minimum edge weight, node_u and node_v are integers representing the vertices of the minimum edge, colors is a list of integers representing the colors of the vertices, and res is a list of integers representing the result of the depth-first search.
