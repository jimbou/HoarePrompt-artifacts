Postcondition: ***curr is a node in the graph, parent is the parent node of curr in the current DFS path, path is the current DFS path with curr appended, colors is a list of colors (0, 1, or 2) for each node in the graph with the color of curr changed to 1, graph is an adjacency list representation of the graph where graph[curr] has at least two neighbors, node_v is a node in the graph, nei is the next neighbor of curr in the list graph[curr], res is the result of the dfs function called with nei, curr, and path as arguments, and set_res is a set containing the elements of res. If res is not empty and node_v is in set_res, the program returns the result of the dfs function called with nei, curr, and path as arguments. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
