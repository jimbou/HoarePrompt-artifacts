Output State: **`test_cases` is a returned value of `func_1()`, and it is unknown what this value is because the definition of `func_1()` is not provided.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` has been updated to be the returned value of `func_1()`. However, since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, the exact value of `test_cases` is unknown. The initial state of `test_cases` being a non-negative integer is no longer valid, as its value has been overwritten by the returned value of `func_1()`.
