Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5) and m is at least m, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with 2*m edges (u, v) and (v, u), edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class representing a disjoint-set data structure with n+1 elements, _min_edge is a float representing the minimum edge weight, node_u and node_v are integers representing the vertices of the minimum edge, colors is a list of n+1 zeros, and res is a list of integers representing the result of the depth-first search starting from node_u.**

The code initializes the colors list with n+1 zeros and performs a depth-first search starting from node_u, updating the res list with the result. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
