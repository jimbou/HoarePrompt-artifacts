The only objects in the loop head are variables  `w`, `u`, `v` and `edges`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the edges.  If the list has at least 2 edges the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, edges has at least 1 edge, w is the weight of the second edge, u and v are the vertices of the second edge. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 edges and the w is the weight of the third edge, u and v are the vertices of the third edge.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and `m`, `m` is an integer between `n` and the minimum of `n*(n-1)/2` and `2*10^5`, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with `2*m` edges, `edges` is a sorted list of tuples that must have at least 2 edges, `dsu` is a disjoint-set data structure with `n+1` elements, `colors` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of integers, `w` is the weight of the third edge, `u` and `v` are the vertices of the third edge, and `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight.**
