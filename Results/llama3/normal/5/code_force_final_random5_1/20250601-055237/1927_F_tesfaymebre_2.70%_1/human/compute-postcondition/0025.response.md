Functionality: **This function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal in a graph, starting from a given node 'curr', with the goal of finding a path that includes a specific node 'node_v'. The function takes as input the current node 'curr', its parent node 'parent', the current DFS path, a list of colors for each node in the graph, the graph itself represented as an adjacency list, and the target node 'node_v'. The function returns the DFS path that includes 'node_v' if found, otherwise it returns an empty list. The function also updates the colors of the nodes in the graph during the traversal, marking visited nodes with color 1 and fully explored nodes with color 2.**
