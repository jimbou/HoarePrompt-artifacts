Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to find a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph with the minimum edge weight. It uses a disjoint-set data structure (DSU) to keep track of the connected components in the graph and a depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycle.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of vertices and edges in the graph. It then constructs the graph by reading the edges and their weights.

The program uses the DSU to find the minimum edge weight in the graph. It iterates over the edges in descending order of their weights and checks if the two vertices of the edge are in the same connected component. If they are, it updates the minimum edge weight and the vertices of the minimum edge.

After finding the minimum edge weight and the vertices of the minimum edge, the program uses a DFS to find the cycle that contains the minimum edge. It starts the DFS from one of the vertices of the minimum edge and explores the graph until it finds the other vertex of the minimum edge.

The program then prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices of the cycle in the order they were visited during the DFS.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the DSU and DFS algorithms, and it correctly finds the minimum edge weight and the cycle that contains it. The program also handles the case where there are multiple cycles with the same minimum edge weight by finding the first cycle it encounters.

Correctness: **True**
