The code prints the result of the depth-first search starting from node_u, which is represented by the list res. The list res contains integers representing the nodes visited during the depth-first search.

Output: **[node_u, ..., node_v] (where node_u and node_v are the vertices of the minimum edge and ... represents the nodes visited during the depth-first search)**
