The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is a returned value of `func_1()` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `test_cases` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`test_cases` is a returned value of `func_1()` that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
