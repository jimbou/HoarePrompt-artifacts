To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 0, and `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `test_cases` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

State: **`test_cases` is a returned value of `func_1()` that must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, and the function `func_6()` has been executed twice.**
