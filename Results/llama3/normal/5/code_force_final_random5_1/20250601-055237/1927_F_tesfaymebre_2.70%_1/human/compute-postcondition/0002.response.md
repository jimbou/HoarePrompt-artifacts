Output State: **`test_cases` is a returned value of `func_1()` that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the function `func_6()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The only change is that the function `func_6()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are unknown, as its implementation is not provided.
