Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and `m`, `m` is an integer between `n` and the minimum of `n*(n-1)/2` and 2*10^5, `i` is `m-1`, `graph` is a dictionary with 2*`m` edges, `edges` is a sorted list of tuples that must have at least 2 edges, `dsu` is a disjoint-set data structure with `n+1` elements where `u` and `v` are now in the same set, `colors` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of integers, `w` is the weight of the third edge, `parent_u` is the parent of vertex `u` in the disjoint-set data structure which is now the same as `parent_v`, `parent_v` is the parent of vertex `v` in the disjoint-set data structure which is now the same as `parent_u`, `u` and `v` are the vertices of the third edge, and `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight.**

In natural language, the output state is: The disjoint-set data structure `dsu` now has `u` and `v` in the same set, and the parent of both `u` and `v` is the same. All other variables remain unchanged.
