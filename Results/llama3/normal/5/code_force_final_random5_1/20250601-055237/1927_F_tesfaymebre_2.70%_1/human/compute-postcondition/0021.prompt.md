Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: curr is a node in the graph, parent is the parent node of curr in the current DFS path, path is the current DFS path with curr appended, colors is a list of colors (0, 1, or 2) for each node in the graph with the color of curr changed to 1, graph is an adjacency list representation of the graph, and node_v is a node in the graph.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`curr` is a node in the graph, `parent` is the parent node of `curr` in the current DFS path, `path` is the current DFS path with `curr` appended, `colors` is a list of colors (0, 1, or 2) for each node in the graph with the color of `curr` changed to 1, `graph` is an adjacency list representation of the graph where `graph[curr]` has at least one neighbor, and `node_v` is a node in the graph. If there exists a neighbor `nei` of `curr` such that `nei` is not the parent of `curr` and the color of `nei` is not 2, then `res` is the result of the DFS traversal starting from `nei` with `curr` as the parent, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. Either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`curr` is a node in the graph, `parent` is the parent node of `curr` in the current DFS path, `path` is the current DFS path with `curr` appended, `colors` is a list of colors (0, 1, or 2) for each node in the graph with the color of `curr` changed to 1, `graph` is an adjacency list representation of the graph where `graph[curr]` has at least two neighbors, and `node_v` is a node in the graph. If there exists a neighbor `nei` of `curr` such that `nei` is not the parent of `curr` and the color of `nei` is not 2, then the program returns the result of the DFS traversal starting from `nei` with `curr` as the parent, where `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the list `graph[curr]` and the result of the DFS traversal contains `node_v`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`curr` is a node in the graph, `parent` is the parent node of `curr` in the current DFS path, `path` is the current DFS path with `curr` appended, `colors` is a list of colors (0, 1, or 2) for each node in the graph with the color of `curr` changed to 1, `graph` is an adjacency list representation of the graph where `graph[curr]` has at least two neighbors, `node_v` is a node in the graph, and `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the list `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not the parent of `curr`, the program returns the result of the dfs function called with `nei`, `curr`, and `path` as arguments if the result is not empty and `node_v` is in the result. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
