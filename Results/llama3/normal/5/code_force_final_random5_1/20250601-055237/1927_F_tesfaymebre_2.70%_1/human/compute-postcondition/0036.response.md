The code prints the minimum edge weight, which is stored in the variable `_min_edge`, and the length of the result list, which is stored in the variable `res`. The result list contains the result of the depth-first search starting from node `node_u`.

Output: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer such that n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5) and m is at least m, i is m-1, graph is a dictionary with 2*m edges (u, v) and (v, u), edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class representing a disjoint-set data structure with n+1 elements, _min_edge is a float representing the minimum edge weight, node_u and node_v are integers representing the vertices of the minimum edge, colors is a list of n+1 zeros, and res is a list of integers representing the result of the depth-first search starting from node_u, and this is printed: the minimum edge weight which is _min_edge and the length of the result list which is len(res)**
