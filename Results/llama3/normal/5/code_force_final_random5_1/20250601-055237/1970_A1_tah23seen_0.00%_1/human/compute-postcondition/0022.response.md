Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is a string consisting of three characters from `s` (either "(((", "(()", "(())", "()(", ")()", "))(" or ")))"), `i` is the third key in `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the character at index `i` of string `s`. Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the new character appended to `ans` can be either "(" or ")". The other variables remain unchanged.
