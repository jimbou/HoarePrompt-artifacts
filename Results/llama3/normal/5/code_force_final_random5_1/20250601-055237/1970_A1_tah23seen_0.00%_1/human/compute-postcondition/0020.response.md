The code `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `s` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is the second key in dictionary `d`, we know that `i` is an integer. The string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")".


Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is a string consisting of two characters from `s` (either "((" , "()" or "))"), `i` is the second key in `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs**
