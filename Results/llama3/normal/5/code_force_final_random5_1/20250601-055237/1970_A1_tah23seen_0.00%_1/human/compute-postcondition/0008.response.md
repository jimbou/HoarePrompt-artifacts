Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `d` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to 1, and 2 maps to 2.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i + 1]` has been updated to `d[i] + 1`, where `i` is 1. Since `d[1]` is 1, `d[2]` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
