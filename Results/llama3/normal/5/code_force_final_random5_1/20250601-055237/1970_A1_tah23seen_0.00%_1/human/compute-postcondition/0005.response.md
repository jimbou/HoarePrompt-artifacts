Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0 and `i + 1` maps to `d[i] - 1`, `i` is 0, `len(s)` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")"**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is `i + 1` and the value is `d[i] - 1`. The value of `d[i]` is 0, so the new value is -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
