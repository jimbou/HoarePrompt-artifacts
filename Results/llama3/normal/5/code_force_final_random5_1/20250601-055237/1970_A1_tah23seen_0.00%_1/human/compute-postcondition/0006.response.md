Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `len(s)` must be greater than 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is "(", then `d` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to 1, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")", then `d` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0 and `i + 1` maps to `d[i] - 1`, and `i` is 0.***
