To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s` (since `len(s)` is used in the loop head).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `i` is 0, we need to increment it by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1.

The state of `s` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables `n`, `ans`, and `d` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `d` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to 1**
