Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, i is n-1, and d is a dictionary with n key-value pairs: the keys are a subset of the range from 0 to n (exclusive), and the values are a strictly increasing sequence of integers from 0 to n-1, with each key k mapping to the value that is the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses in the substring of s from index 0 to k (exclusive).
Code of the loop:
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is a string consisting of one character from `s` (either "(" or ")"), `i` is within the range of keys in `d` (from 0 to `n-1`), and `d` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is a string consisting of two characters from `s` (either "((" , "()" or "))"), `i` is the second key in `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is a string consisting of three characters from `s` (either "(((", "(()", "(())", "()(", ")()", "))(" or ")))"), `i` is the third key in `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
