Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `d` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to 1, and 2 maps to 0**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is `i + 1` (which is 2) and the value is `d[i] - 1` (which is 0). The other variables remain unchanged.
