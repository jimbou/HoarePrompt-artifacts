Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 2, and `d` is a dictionary with four key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to 1, 2 maps to either 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', otherwise 2 maps to 0, and 3 maps to either 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', otherwise 3 maps to -1**

In this output state, the value of `d[i + 1]` has been updated to `d[i] - 1`, where `i` is 2. Since `d[2]` is either 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', otherwise 2 maps to 0, the value of `d[3]` will be either 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', otherwise 3 maps to -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
