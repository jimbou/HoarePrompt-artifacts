Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing `n` integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is not defined, `stdin` contains 0 lines of input.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` becomes 0, the list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in list `T` up to the current index, the value of `i` becomes `n-1`, and the number of lines in `stdin` becomes 0. The values of `n` and `T` remain unchanged.
