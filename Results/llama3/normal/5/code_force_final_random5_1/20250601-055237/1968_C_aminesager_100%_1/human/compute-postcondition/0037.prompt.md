Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains 2*t lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). Each of the following t lines contains n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing `n` integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T[:n-1]), `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `stdin` contains `2*t - 2` lines of input, and the string `result` containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing `n` integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 lines of input, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 2 and 500, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], i is n-1, result is a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a is being printed: "1000 1000 + T[0] 1000 + T[0] + T[1] ... 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]"


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
