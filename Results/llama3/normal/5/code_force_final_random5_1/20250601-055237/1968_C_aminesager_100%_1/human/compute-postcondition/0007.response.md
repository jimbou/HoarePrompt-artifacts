To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables in the state, `t`, `T`, `a`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing three integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `stdin` contains `2*t - 2` lines of input, `i` is 3**
