Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that satisfies the given conditions. The key insight is that for each x_i, we can choose a_i to be a_i-1 + x_i, which ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_i-1. This is because a_i-1 + x_i is a multiple of a_i-1, and when divided by a_i-1, it leaves a remainder of x_i.

The program initializes a_1 to 1000, which is an arbitrary choice that satisfies the condition 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Then, for each x_i, it calculates a_i as a_i-1 + x_i and appends it to the array a.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases such as when n = 2 or when x_i = 1. The output format is also correct, printing the array a as a space-separated string.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
