Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 4 integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `i` is 3, `result` is not defined, `stdin` contains `2*t - 4` lines of input**

The value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the last element of `a` and the third element of `T`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3, and `result` is still not defined. The number of lines in `stdin` remains the same.
