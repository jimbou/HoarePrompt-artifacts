The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is the sum of the last element in `a` (which is 1000) and the first element in `T` (which is an integer between 1 and 500). The value of `i` is 1, so `i - 1` is 0, which is the index of the last element in `a` and the first element in `T`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing two integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `stdin` contains `2*t - 2` lines of input, `i` is 1**
