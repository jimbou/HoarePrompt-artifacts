Output State: **t is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 2 and 500, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], i is n-1, result is a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of result is a string that contains the elements of list a, separated by spaces. This string is created by converting each element of list a to a string using the map function, and then joining these strings together with spaces in between using the join function. The other variables, t, n, T, a, i, and stdin, remain unchanged.
