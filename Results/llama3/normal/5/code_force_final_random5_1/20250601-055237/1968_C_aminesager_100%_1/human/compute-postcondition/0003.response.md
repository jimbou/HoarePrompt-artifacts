To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, which already satisfies the condition. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts from 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing a single integer 1000, `stdin` contains `2*t - 2` lines of input, `i` is 1**
