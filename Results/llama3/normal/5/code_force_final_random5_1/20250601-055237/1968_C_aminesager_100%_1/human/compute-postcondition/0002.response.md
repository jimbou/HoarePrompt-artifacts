Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 2 and 500, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing a single integer 1000, stdin contains 2*t - 2 lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, `n` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, and `T` has been assigned the list of integers from the second line of input. The list `a` has been initialized with a single integer 1000. The number of lines in stdin has been reduced by 2 due to the two input operations.
