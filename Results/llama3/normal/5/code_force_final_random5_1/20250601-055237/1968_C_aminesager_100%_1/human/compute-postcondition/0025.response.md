According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is not equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing `n` integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 lines of input, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is being printed**
