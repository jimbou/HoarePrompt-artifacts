Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 2 integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1, `result` is not defined, `stdin` contains `2*t - 4` lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new integer, which is the sum of the first element of `a` (1000) and the first element of `T` (T[0]). The other variables remain unchanged.
