Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing `n` integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T[:n-1]), `stdin` contains `2*t - 2` lines of input, `i` is `n-1`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `T`. The list `a` now contains `n` elements, each of which is the sum of the initial value 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` up to the current index. The variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of the other variables, `t` and `stdin`, remains unchanged.
