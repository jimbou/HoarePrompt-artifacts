The `print(result)` statement will print a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a`. 

List `a` is constructed by starting with the number 1000 and then adding each element of list `T` to the previous number in sequence. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, list `a` will have `n` elements. The first element of `a` is 1000, the second element is 1000 + T[0], the third element is 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and so on, until the nth element which is 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2].

Since the exact values of the elements in list `T` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a`.

Output: **1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2] (where T[i] are the elements of list T)**
