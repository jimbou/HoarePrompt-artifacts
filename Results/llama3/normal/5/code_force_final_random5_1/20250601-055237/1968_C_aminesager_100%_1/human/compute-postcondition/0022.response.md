Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing `n` integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `result` is a string that contains the elements of list `a` separated by spaces. The elements of `a` are calculated by adding the corresponding elements of list `T` to 1000, starting from the first element of `T` and adding each subsequent element to the previous sum. The value of `result` is a string representation of these sums, separated by spaces.
