Output State: **`t` is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 4 integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `i` is 3, `result` is not defined, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is being printed.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`, which is the sum of the element at index `i-1` in `a` and the element at index `i-1` in `T`. Since `i` is 3, this means the new element is the sum of the third element in `a` (1000 + T[0] + T[1]) and the third element in `T` (T[2]). The other variables remain unchanged.
