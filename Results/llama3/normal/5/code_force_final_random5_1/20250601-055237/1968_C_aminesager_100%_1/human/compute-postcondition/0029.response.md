The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 2 integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 2, `result` is not defined, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is being printed.**
