The function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n-1 integers. The function processes each test case by creating a list a of n integers, where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding integer from the input line. The function then prints a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a. The function repeats this process t times, until all test cases have been processed, at which point stdin contains 0 lines of input.
