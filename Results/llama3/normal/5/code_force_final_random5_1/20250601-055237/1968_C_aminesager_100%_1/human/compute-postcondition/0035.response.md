Based on the initial state, the print statement will print a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a.

The list a is constructed by starting with 1000 and then adding each element of list T to the previous element. Since T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, the elements of a will be 1000, 1001 to 1500.

The variable i is n-1, but it is not used in the print statement.

The variable t is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, but it is also not used in the print statement.

The variable stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, but it is not used in the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will print a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a, which are 1000, 1001 to 1500.

Output: **1000, 1001, 1002, ..., 1500 (where the numbers are the elements of list a)**
