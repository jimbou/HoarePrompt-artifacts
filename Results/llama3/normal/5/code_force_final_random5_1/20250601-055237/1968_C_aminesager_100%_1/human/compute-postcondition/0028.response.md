Output State: **`t` is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 2 integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1, `result` is not defined, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the first element of `a` (1000) and the first element of `T` (T[0]). The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an empty line, and the string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is still being printed.
