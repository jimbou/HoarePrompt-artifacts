The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains 2*t lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). Each of the following t lines contains n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).**
