Output State: **t is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 2 and 500, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], i is n-1, result is not defined, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The value of t remains unchanged, n is still an integer between 2 and 500, T is still a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is now a list containing n integers where each integer is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in T up to that point, i is now n-1, result is still not defined, stdin still contains an empty line, and the string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a is still being printed.
