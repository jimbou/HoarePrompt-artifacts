Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains 2*t lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). Each of the following t lines contains n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).**

The code assigns the value of the first line of input to `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The remaining input lines are still in the stdin, with the first line containing a single integer n, and each of the following t lines containing n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n.
