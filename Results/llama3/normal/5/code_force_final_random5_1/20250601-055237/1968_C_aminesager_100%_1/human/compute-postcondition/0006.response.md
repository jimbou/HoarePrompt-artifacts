Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing three integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `stdin` contains `2*t - 2` lines of input, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include a new element, which is the sum of the second last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i - 1]`) and the second element of `T` (i.e., `T[i - 1]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
