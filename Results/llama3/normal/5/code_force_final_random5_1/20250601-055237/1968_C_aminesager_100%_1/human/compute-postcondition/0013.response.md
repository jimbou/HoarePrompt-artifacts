According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing `n` integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T[:n-1]), `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `stdin` contains `2*t - 2` lines of input, and the string `result` containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces is being printed**
