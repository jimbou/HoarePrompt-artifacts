Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing four integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `stdin` contains `2*t - 2` lines of input, `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still greater than 3, the list `T` remains the same, the list `a` now contains four integers where the last integer is the sum of the third integer in `a` and the third integer in `T`, the number of lines in `stdin` remains the same, and the value of `i` is still 3.
