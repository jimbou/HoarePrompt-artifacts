Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 3 integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 2, `result` is not defined, `stdin` contains `2*t - 4` lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the second last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i - 1]`) and the second element of `T` (i.e., `T[i - 1]`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
