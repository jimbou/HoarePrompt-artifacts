Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that satisfies the conditions x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n, where x_2, x_3, ..., x_n are given.

The program initializes the first element of the array a as 1000, which is within the allowed range of 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Then, for each subsequent element a_i, it calculates the value as the sum of the previous element a_{i-1} and the corresponding input value x_i. This ensures that a_i mod a_{i-1} equals x_i, satisfying the problem's condition.

The program repeats this process for each test case, and the final array a is printed as a string of space-separated integers.

Correctness: **True**
