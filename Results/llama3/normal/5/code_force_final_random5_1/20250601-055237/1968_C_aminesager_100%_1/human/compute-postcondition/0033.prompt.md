Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer between 2 and 500, T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list containing 1 integer: 1000, i is not defined, result is not defined, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list a is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 2 integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1, `result` is not defined, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 3 integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 2, `result` is not defined, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is not equal to 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `T` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list containing 4 integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `i` is 3, `result` is not defined, stdin contains 1 line of input: an empty line, and a string of space-separated integers corresponding to the elements of list `a` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
