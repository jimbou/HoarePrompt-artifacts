The code calculates and prints the total cost of buying `k` items at a price of `b` and the remaining `n - k` items at a price of `a`. Here, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

Output: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code, and the total cost of buying k items at a price of b and the remaining n - k items at a price of a is printed**
