Output: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code, and this is printed: the product of a and n which is equal to a * n**
