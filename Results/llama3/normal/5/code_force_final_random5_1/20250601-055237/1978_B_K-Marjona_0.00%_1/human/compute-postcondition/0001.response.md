The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. Then, it calculates the minimum value between `n` and the difference between `b` and `a`, and assigns this value to the variable `k`.

Output State: **n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code**
