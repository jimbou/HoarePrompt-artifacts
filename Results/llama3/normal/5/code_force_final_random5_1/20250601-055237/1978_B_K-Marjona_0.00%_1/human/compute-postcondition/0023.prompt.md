Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n, which is a*n, is being printed. If b is larger than a, the sum of the integers from a to b is printed, where the first k integers are from b - k + 1 to b, and the remaining n - k integers are all a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n which is equal to a * n is printed. Otherwise, the total cost of buying k items at a price of b and the remaining n - k items at a price of a is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n which is equal to a*n is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the products of the number of terms and the average of the first and last terms of two arithmetic sequences is printed: the first sequence has k terms with the first term b - k + 1 and the last term b, and the second sequence has n - k terms with the first and last term a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
