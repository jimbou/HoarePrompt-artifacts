Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code.**

The code reads three integers from the first line of stdin and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively. The value of `k` is then calculated as the minimum between `n` and the difference between `b` and `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input, and `k` is assigned a value based on the calculated minimum. Stdin is updated to contain at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code.
