The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` has at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `input()` has at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code. So for the loop to be executed one more time `input()` must have at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code.**
