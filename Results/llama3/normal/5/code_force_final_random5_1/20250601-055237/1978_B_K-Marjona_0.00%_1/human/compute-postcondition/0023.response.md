Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and the output for each test case has been printed. The loop has executed for a number of times equal to the number of test cases in the input.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished executing for all test cases in the input, and the output for each test case has been printed. The loop has iterated for a number of times equal to the number of test cases in the input, and all variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The state of other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
