Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n which is equal to a * n is printed. Otherwise, the total cost of buying k items at a price of b and the remaining n - k items at a price of a is printed.***
