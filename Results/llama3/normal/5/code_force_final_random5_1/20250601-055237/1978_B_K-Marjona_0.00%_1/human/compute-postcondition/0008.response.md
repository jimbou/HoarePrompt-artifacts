Postcondition: ***n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n, which is a*n, is being printed. If b is larger than a, the sum of the integers from a to b is printed, where the first k integers are from b - k + 1 to b, and the remaining n - k integers are all a.***
