To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution) and the `input()` function.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to ensure it contains at least one test case.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one test case**
