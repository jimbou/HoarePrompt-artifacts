This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the values of n, a, and b. If b is less than or equal to a, the cost is simply a times n. Otherwise, the cost is calculated using the formula (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a, where k is the minimum of n and b - a. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been read, printing the result for each case.
