Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from the first line of stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n which is equal to a*n is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the products of the number of terms and the average of the first and last terms of two arithmetic sequences is printed: the first sequence has k terms with the first term b - k + 1 and the last term b, and the second sequence has n - k terms with the first and last term a.***
