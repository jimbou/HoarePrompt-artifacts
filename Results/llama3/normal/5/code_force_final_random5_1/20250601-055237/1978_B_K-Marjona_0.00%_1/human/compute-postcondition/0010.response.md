Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from stdin, a is an integer equal to the second integer from stdin, b is an integer equal to the third integer from stdin, k is an integer equal to the minimum value between n and b - a, stdin contains at least one test case minus the three integers read by the code**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers read from stdin. The value of `k` is calculated as the minimum between the new value of `n` and the difference between the new values of `b` and `a`. Stdin is updated to reflect that three integers have been read.
