Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` is not used anywhere in the program, so we can ignore it. `func_2` is the main function that calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The function `func_2` iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m`. For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` using the formulas `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. Then, it adds the ceiling of `x / y` plus a boolean value indicating whether `x` is a multiple of `y` to the count `cnt`.

The key insight here is that the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` is equivalent to `a+b = k * b * gcd(a,b)` for some integer `k`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, we can write `a = i * gcd(a,b)` and `b = j * gcd(a,b)` for some integers `i` and `j`. Substituting these expressions into the condition, we get `i * gcd(a,b) + j * gcd(a,b) = k * j * gcd(a,b) * gcd(a,b)`, which simplifies to `i + j = k * j * gcd(a,b)`.

Now, let's analyze the loop in `func_2`. For each `i`, we are effectively counting the number of `j` values that satisfy the condition `i + j = k * j * gcd(a,b)`. Since `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, we can rewrite the condition as `i + j = k * j * gcd(i,j)`. Notice that `gcd(i,j)` is a divisor of `i`, so we can write `i = i' * gcd(i,j)` for some integer `i'`. Substituting this into the condition, we get `i' * gcd(i,j) + j = k * j * gcd(i,j)`, which simplifies to `i' + j/gcd(i,j) = k * j`.

The loop in `func_2` effectively counts the number of `j` values that satisfy this condition. For each `i`, we calculate `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, and then add the ceiling of `x / y` plus a boolean value indicating whether `x` is a multiple of `y` to the count `cnt`. This is equivalent to counting the number of `j` values that satisfy the condition `i' + j/gcd(i,j) = k * j`, which is the same as the original condition.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions, and the correctness is **True**.
