To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, m + 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `m` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop iteration.

The other variables `n`, `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `cnt` is -1 plus the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) divided by (i * i) plus 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i), `i` is 3, `x` is n - (i * i - i), `y` is i * i**
