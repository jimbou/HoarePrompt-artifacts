Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is at least 1, cnt is -1 plus the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) divided by (i * i) plus 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i), i is 2, x is n - (i * i - i), y is i * i**

The code snippet consists of three lines, each of which updates the values of variables in the initial state. The first line updates the value of `x` to be `n - (i * i - i)`, which is the same as its initial value. The second line updates the value of `y` to be `i * i`, which is also the same as its initial value. The third line updates the value of `cnt` by adding the ceiling of `x / y` and 1 if `x` is divisible by `y`. Since `x` is `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` is `i * i`, the ceiling of `x / y` is the same as the ceiling of `(n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)`, which is the same as the initial value of `cnt`. Therefore, the value of `cnt` remains the same. The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet.
