Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used anywhere in the program.

`func_2` calculates a count based on the input positive integers `n` and `m`. It iterates through a range from 1 to `m`, performing calculations involving `n` and the current iteration number, and accumulating the results. The final count is returned, taking into account the ceiling of a division and an additional value if a certain condition is met.

The key insight here is that the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` can be rewritten as `a+b = k * b * gcd(a,b)` for some integer `k`. Since `gcd(a,b)` divides both `a` and `b`, we can write `a = x * gcd(a,b)` and `b = y * gcd(a,b)` for some integers `x` and `y`. Substituting these into the condition, we get `x * gcd(a,b) + y * gcd(a,b) = k * y * gcd(a,b) * gcd(a,b)`, which simplifies to `x + y = k * y * gcd(a,b)`.

Now, since `x` and `y` are integers, `x + y` must be an integer multiple of `y`. This means that `k * y * gcd(a,b)` must be an integer multiple of `y`, which implies that `k * gcd(a,b)` is an integer.

The program uses this insight to calculate the count of ordered pairs. It iterates through all possible values of `y` (which corresponds to the loop variable `i` in `func_2`) and calculates the number of possible values of `x` that satisfy the condition. The calculation involves the ceiling of a division and an additional value if a certain condition is met, which corresponds to the `math.ceil` and `(x % y == 0)` expressions in `func_2`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the count of ordered pairs satisfying the given conditions, and the execution summaries of the functions match the expected behavior, the program is correct.
