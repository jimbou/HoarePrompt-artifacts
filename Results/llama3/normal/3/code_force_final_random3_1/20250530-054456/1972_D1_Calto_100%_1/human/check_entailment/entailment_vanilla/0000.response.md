Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a specific problem involving ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is not directly used in the main calculation but is likely included for potential use in other parts of the program or for testing purposes.

`func_2` is the core function that calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. It iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m` (inclusive) and for each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` based on the formulas `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. Then, it increments the count `cnt` by the ceiling of `x / y` plus 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`).

The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem. The condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` is not directly addressed by the program. Instead, the program seems to be trying to count pairs based on a different criterion that involves the formulas for `x` and `y`, which do not appear to be related to the problem's conditions.

Furthermore, the program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are both 1, which is a valid pair according to the problem statement.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the given Python program, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
