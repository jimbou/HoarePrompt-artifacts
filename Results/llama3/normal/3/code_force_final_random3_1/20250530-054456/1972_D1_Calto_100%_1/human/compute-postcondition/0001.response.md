To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. Since `m` is already a positive integer, we can focus on `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. Since `m` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `m` is at least 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1**
