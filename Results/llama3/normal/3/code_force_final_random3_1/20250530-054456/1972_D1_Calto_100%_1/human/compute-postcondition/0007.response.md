Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is at least 1, cnt is -1 plus the ceiling of (n - (m * m - m)) divided by (m * m) plus 1 if (n - (m * m - m)) is divisible by (m * m), i is m, x is n - (m * m - m), y is m * m**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `cnt` has been incremented by the ceiling of `(n - (m * m - m))` divided by `(m * m)`, plus 1 if `(n - (m * m - m))` is divisible by `(m * m)`. The value of `i` has reached its final value, which is `m`. The values of `x` and `y` have also been updated to their final values, which are `n - (m * m - m)` and `m * m`, respectively.
