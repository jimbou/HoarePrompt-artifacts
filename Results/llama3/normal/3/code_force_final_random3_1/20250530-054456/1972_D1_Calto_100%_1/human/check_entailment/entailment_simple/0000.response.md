Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The given program uses two functions: `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, and `func_2` to calculate the number of valid pairs.

In `func_2`, the program iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m`. For each `i`, it calculates `x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`. Then, it increments the count `cnt` by the ceiling of `x / y` plus 1 if `x` is divisible by `y`.

The key insight here is that the condition `a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)` is equivalent to `a + b is a multiple of b * i`, where `i` is the gcd of `a` and `b`. This is because `gcd(a, b)` is a divisor of both `a` and `b`, and therefore `b * gcd(a, b)` is a divisor of `a + b`.

The program uses this insight to count the number of valid pairs. For each `i`, it calculates the number of possible values of `a` that satisfy the condition `a + b is a multiple of b * i`. This is done by calculating the ceiling of `x / y`, which gives the number of multiples of `y` that are less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, it adds 1 to the count to account for the case where `a` is equal to `x`.

The program returns the total count of valid pairs, which is the sum of the counts for each `i`.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs satisfying the given conditions. The use of the gcd function and the iteration over all possible values of `i` ensure that all possible pairs are considered. The calculation of the count for each `i` is also correct, taking into account the divisibility of `x` by `y`. Therefore, the program produces the correct output for the given inputs.
