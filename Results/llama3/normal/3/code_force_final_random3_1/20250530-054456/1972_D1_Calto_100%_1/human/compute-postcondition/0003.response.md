To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, m + 1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables in the loop head are `m`, which is a positive integer that is at least 1. Since `m` is not modified by the loop, its state remains the same.

The other variables `n`, `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `cnt` is -1 plus the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) divided by (i * i) plus 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i), `i` is 2, `x` is n - (i * i - i), `y` is i * i**
