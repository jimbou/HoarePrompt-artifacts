#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor of the initial a and b, b is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial a and b

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, modifying the input variables in the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers.
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is at least 1, cnt is -1 plus the ceiling of (n - (m * m - m)) divided by (m * m) plus 1 if (n - (m * m - m)) is divisible by (m * m), i is m, x is n - (m * m - m), y is m * m
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt, which is -1 plus the ceiling of (n - (m * m - m)) divided by (m * m) plus 1 if (n - (m * m - m)) is divisible by (m * m), where n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer that is at least 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns a count based on the input positive integers n and m, where the count is determined by iterating through a range from 1 to m, performing calculations involving n and the current iteration number, and accumulating the results. The final count is returned, taking into account the ceiling of a division and an additional value if a certain condition is met.
