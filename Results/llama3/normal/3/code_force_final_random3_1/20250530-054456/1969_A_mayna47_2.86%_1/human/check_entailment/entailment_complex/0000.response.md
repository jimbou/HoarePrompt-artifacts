Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them attend the party. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if the number of friends (n) is 2. If n is 2, it prints 2, as both friends need to receive an invitation to attend.

For n greater than 2, the program checks if there exists a cycle of length 3 in the friendship graph, where friend i's best friend is friend j, friend j's best friend is friend k, and friend k's best friend is friend i. If such a cycle exists, it prints 2, as inviting friends i and j would result in both of them attending the party.

However, the program does not handle the case where no such cycle of length 3 exists. In this case, the program does not produce any output, which is incorrect. The program should print the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
