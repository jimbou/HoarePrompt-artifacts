Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i) from the input, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) as specified in the initial state. The list `v` now contains `n+1` integers, where the first element is 0 (as initialized in the first line of code), and the remaining elements are the `n` distinct integers `p_i` (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i) from the input. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed by the code.
