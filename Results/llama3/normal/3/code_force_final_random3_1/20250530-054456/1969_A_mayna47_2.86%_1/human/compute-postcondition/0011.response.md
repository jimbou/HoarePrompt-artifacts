To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive). To execute the loop again, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and for all i, v[v[v[i]]] is not equal to i**
