Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), i is n+1, stdin contains t-n test cases. If v[v[v[i]]] equals i, then 2 is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.
    #State: *n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i) from the input, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n equals 2, the integer 2 is being printed. If n is between 3 and 50 (inclusive), if v[v[v[i]]] equals i, then 2 is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and prints output based on the conditions met. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). If n equals 2, it prints 2. For n between 3 and 50, it checks if v[v[v[i]]] equals i and prints 2 if true; otherwise, no output is produced. The function modifies the input list v and consumes input from stdin.
