Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), i is 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If v[v[v[i]]] equals i, then 2 is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.***
