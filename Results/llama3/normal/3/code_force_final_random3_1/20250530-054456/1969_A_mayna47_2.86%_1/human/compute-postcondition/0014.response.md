Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and for all i, v[v[v[i]]] is not equal to i. If v[v[v[i]]] equals i, then 2 is printed.***
