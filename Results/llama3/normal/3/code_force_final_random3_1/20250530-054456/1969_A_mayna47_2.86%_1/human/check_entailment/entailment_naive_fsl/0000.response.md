Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party. 

The program first checks if the number of friends is 2, in which case it prints 2 because both friends need to be invited. 

If the number of friends is more than 2, it checks for each friend if their best friend's best friend is the friend themselves. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2 because inviting these two friends will make both of them attend the party. 

If it doesn't find such a pair, it prints 3 because in the worst case, Monocarp needs to invite 3 friends to make at least 2 of them attend the party. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
