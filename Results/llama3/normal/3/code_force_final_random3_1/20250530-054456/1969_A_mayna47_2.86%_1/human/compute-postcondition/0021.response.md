Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and prints output based on the conditions met. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). If n equals 2, it prints 2. For n between 3 and 50, it checks if v[v[v[i]]] equals i and prints 2 if true; otherwise, no output is produced. The function modifies the input list v and consumes input from stdin.**
