Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i) from the input, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n equals 2, the integer 2 is being printed. If n is between 3 and 50 (inclusive), if v[v[v[i]]] equals i, then 2 is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.***
