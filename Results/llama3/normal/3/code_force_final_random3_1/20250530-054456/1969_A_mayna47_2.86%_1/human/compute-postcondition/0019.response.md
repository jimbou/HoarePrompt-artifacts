Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), i is n+1, stdin contains t-n test cases. If v[v[v[i]]] equals i, then 2 is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `v`, and the value of `i` has reached `n+1`. The state of the other variables, `n` and `stdin`, remains unchanged. If at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` was true, the number 2 was printed. Otherwise, no output was produced.
