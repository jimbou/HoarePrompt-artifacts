Output: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of v[v[v[i]]] equals i, and 2 is being printed**
