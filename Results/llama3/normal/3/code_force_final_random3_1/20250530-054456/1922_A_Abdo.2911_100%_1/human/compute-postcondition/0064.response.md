Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `possible` is True, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the program continues with the current state. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
