Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 0, `possible` is False, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0, and `possible` is still False. The current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the program moves to the next iteration.
