Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, possible is False, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, the character at index i in string a is not equal to the character at index i in string b, and the character at index i in string c is either equal to the character at index i in string a or equal to the character at index i in string b, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, n, a, b, c, possible, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of i remains 0. The conditions regarding the characters at index i in strings a, b, and c also remain the same. The only change is that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration due to the continue statement.
