Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a and also equal to the character at index i in string b, then i is 2. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a but not equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True. If the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a but equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True. If the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a and also not equal to the character at index i in string b, then i is 1 and possible is True.***
