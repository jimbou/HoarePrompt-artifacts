The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters. If there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, or if there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
