Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, the character at index i in string a is not equal to the character at index i in string b. If the character at index i in string c is either equal to the character at index i in string a or equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is False and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, possible is True.***
