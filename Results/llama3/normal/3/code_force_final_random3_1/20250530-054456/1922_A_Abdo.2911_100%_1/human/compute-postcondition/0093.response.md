Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 1. If the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a and not equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True. Otherwise, if c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration.**
