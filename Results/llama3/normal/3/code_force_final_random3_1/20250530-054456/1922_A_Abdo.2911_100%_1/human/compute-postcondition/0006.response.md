Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, possible is True, i is 0. The current value of a[i] is equal to the current value of b[i]. The current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of a[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `possible` to `True`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed within. However, in this context, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the flow of the program. 

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `possible` becomes `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect them in the absence of a loop or switch construct.
