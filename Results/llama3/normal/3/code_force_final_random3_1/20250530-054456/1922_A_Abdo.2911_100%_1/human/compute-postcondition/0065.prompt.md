Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, possible is False, stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0. If the character at index i in string a is equal to the character at index i in string b, then if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, possible is True. Otherwise, the value of possible remains unchanged. If the character at index i in string a is not equal to the character at index i in string b, then if the character at index i in string c is either equal to the character at index i in string a or equal to the character at index i in string b, possible is False and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, possible is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a and also equal to the character at index i in string b, then i is 2. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a but not equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True. If the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a but equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True. If the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a and also not equal to the character at index i in string b, then i is 1 and possible is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `possible` is True, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the program continues with the current state. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
