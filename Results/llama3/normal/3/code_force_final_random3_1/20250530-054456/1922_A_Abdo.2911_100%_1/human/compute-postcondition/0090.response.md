The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since `i` is 1, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the first iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 1, and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration.**
