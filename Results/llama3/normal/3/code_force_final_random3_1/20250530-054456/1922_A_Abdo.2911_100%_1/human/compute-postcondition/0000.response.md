The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. After the code is executed, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and the stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
