Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `possible` is True, `i` is 3 and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `stdin`, and `possible` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3. The only change is that the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration.
