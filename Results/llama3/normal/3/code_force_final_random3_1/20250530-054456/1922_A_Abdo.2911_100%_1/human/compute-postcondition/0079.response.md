Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 0. If the current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of a[i], then possible is True. Otherwise, the value of possible remains unchanged. The current value of a[i] is equal to the current value of b[i].***
