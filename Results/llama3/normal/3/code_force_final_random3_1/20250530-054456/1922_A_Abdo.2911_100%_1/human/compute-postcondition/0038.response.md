Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, possible is False, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is between 0 and 20, and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from stdin, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. The variable `possible` is initialized to `False`. The code does not modify the value of `t`, which remains an integer between 2 and 1000. After executing the code, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.
