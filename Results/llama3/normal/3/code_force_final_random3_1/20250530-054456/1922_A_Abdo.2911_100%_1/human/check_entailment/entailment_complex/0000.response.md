Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program then checks if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. It does this by iterating over each character in the strings and checking the conditions specified in the problem description.
4. If the program finds a position where the characters in `a` and `b` are different and the character in `c` is different from both, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
5. After checking all positions, if `possible` is `True`, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The execution states of the program provided as comments also match the expected behavior. The program correctly handles the input and produces the expected output for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
