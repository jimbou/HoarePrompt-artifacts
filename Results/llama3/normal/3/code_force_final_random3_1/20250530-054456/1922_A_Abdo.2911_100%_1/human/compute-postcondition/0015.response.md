The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown, `n` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than `i+1` and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is increased by 1**
