Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than `i+3` and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is increased by 2 and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and since we are moving to the next iteration, it is effectively increased by 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` is decreased by 1, so it now contains `t-2` test cases.
