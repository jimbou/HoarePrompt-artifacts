The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are inside a loop and `i` is 1, the value of `i` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2**
