Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `possible` is False, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration, due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
