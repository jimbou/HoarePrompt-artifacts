Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, possible is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped and `possible` remains False; otherwise, `possible` is set to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than `i+1` and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is True. Otherwise, the program does not change the state of the variables. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `i` is increased by 2 and `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `possible` is set to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than `i+2` and less than or equal to 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is True. Otherwise, if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `i` is increased by 2 and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `possible` is set to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
