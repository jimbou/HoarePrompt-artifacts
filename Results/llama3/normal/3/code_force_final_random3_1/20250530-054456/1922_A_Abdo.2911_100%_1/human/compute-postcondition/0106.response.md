Based on the initial state, the code will print 'NO' because the variable possible is False, and there does not exist any index i such that a[i] is not equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i] and c[i] is not equal to b[i]. This means that the conditions for possible to be True are not met, so the code will print 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
