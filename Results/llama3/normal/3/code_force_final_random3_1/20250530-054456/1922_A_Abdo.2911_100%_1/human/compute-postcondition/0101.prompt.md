Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n, possible is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 0. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then if c[i] is not equal to a[i], possible is True. Otherwise, the value of possible remains unchanged. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, possible is set to True and c[i] is neither equal to a[i] nor equal to b[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 1. If the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a and not equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True. Otherwise, if c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 2. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then if the character at index i of string c is not equal to the character at index i of string a, possible is True. Otherwise, if the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or string b, then we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, possible is set to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
