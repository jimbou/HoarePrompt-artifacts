The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The second line is a `break` statement, which is used to exit a loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

Considering the initial state, the only change is the assignment of the value `True` to the variable `possible`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 1, possible is True**
