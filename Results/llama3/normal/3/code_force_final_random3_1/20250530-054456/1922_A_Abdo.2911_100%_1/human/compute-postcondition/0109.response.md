Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n. If there exists at least one index i such that a[i] is not equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i] and c[i] is not equal to b[i], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The stdin will be empty, as all input has been read. The variables n, a, b, and c will retain their last values from the last iteration of the loop, and the variable i will be equal to n. The loop will have printed either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, depending on whether the conditions specified in the loop were met.
