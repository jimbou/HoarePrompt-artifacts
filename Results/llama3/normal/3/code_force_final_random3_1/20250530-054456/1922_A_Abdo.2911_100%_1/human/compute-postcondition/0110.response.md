Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists at least one position where the corresponding characters in the first two strings are different and the character in the third string is different from both. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
