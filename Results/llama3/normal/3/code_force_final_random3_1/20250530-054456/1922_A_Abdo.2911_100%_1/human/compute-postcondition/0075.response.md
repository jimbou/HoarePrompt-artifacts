To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 0, `possible` is False**
