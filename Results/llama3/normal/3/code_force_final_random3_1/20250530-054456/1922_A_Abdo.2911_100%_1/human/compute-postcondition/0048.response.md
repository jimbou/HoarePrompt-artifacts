Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, possible is True, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is 0, the character at index i in string a is not equal to the character at index i in string b, and the character at index i in string c is neither equal to the character at index i in string a nor equal to the character at index i in string b**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `possible` to `True`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, in this context, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the state of the variables.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `possible` becomes `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
