The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since we are directly inside a loop, we move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases. The value of i is still 2. 

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 2 and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
