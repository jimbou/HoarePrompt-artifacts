Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than `i+2` and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is increased by 2**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since `i` was already increased by 1 before the `continue` statement, it will be increased by another 1 in the next iteration, making it increased by 2 in total. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1, from `t-1` to `t-2`.
