Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer greater than i+1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is increased by 1. If c[i] is not equal to a[i], then possible is True. Otherwise, the program does not change the state of the variables.***
