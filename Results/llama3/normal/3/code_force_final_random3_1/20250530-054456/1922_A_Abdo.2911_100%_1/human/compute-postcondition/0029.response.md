Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `possible` is True if there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, or if there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the variable `possible` is set to True if there exists at least one index `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, or if there exists at least one index `i` where `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
