To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 2**
