Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 test cases, possible is True, i is n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'possible' is True, and the loop counter 'i' has reached the value of 'n', which is the length of the strings 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The values of 't', 'n', 'a', 'b', 'c', and the contents of 'stdin' remain unchanged.
