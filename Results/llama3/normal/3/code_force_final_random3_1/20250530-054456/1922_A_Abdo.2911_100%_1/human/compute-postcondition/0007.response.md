Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters. If the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
