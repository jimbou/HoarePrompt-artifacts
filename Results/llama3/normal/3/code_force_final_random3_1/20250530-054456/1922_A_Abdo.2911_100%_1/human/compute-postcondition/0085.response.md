Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor equal to `b[i]`.***
