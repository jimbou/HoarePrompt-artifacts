Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters. The current value of `possible` is True, indicating that there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, or there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**
