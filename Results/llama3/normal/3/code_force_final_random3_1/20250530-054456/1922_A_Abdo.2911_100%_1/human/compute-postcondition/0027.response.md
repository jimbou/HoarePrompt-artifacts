Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than `i+2` and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `i` is increased by 2 and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `possible` is set to True.***
