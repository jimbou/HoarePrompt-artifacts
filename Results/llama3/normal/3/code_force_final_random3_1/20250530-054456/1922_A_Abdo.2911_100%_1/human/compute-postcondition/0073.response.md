Let's analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so we don't need to worry about its state.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000
* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20
* `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters
* `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters
* `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters
* `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases
* `i` is `n`
* `possible` is either `True` or `False`, depending on whether 'YES' or 'NO' was printed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop iterates again. Since the loop head only involves the variable `t`, we can only adjust the state of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1, since the loop will iterate `t` times.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `n`, `possible` is either `True` or `False`**

Note that the states of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `stdin`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop iteration.
