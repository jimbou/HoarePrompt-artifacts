Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-2` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

Explanation: The code reads a set of three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m`, respectively. Since `t` is greater than 1, there are `t-1` sets of integers in the input. After reading the first set, there are `t-2` sets remaining in the input. The values of `t` and `i` are not affected by the code.
