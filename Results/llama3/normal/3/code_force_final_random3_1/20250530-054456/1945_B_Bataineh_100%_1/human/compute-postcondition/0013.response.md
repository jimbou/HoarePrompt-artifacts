Output: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). Either `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`. Additionally, either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not greater than `b`. The current value of `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`, and the value of 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` is being printed**
