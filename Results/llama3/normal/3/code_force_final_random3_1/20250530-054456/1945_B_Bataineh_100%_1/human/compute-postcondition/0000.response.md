Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` sets of three space-separated integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, each between 1 and 10^18 inclusive.
