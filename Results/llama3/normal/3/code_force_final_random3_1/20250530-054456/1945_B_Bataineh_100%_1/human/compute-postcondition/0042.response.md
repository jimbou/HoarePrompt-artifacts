Output: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), and this is printed: the integer division of m by a plus the integer division of m by b plus 2**
