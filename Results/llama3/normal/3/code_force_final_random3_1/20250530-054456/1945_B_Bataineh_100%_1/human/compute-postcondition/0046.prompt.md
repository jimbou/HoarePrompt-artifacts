Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m < a and m < b:
        print(2)
    elif m < a and m > b:
        print(2 + m // b)
    elif m < b and m > a:
        print(2 + m // a)
    else:
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the number 2 is printed. If `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the value of 2 + m // b is printed. If `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not greater than `b`, then if `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`, the value of 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-2` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then 2 is printed. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b` is printed. If `m` is between `a` and `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` is printed. Otherwise, `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the number 2 is printed. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b`, the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a`. Otherwise, the program prints the integer division of `m` by `a` plus the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
