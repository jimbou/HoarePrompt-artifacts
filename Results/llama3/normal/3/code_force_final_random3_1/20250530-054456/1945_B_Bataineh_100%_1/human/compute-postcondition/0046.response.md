Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `i` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, which represents the total number of test cases. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will still be integers between 1 and 10^18, but their values will be the last set of values read from the input. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, indicating that all input data has been consumed by the loop.
