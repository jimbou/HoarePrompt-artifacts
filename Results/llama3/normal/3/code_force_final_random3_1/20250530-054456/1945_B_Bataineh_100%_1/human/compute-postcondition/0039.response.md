The code prints the result of the expression `2 + m // a`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18.

Since `m` and `a` are integers, the expression `m // a` performs integer division, which means it divides `m` by `a` and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

The result of this expression is then added to 2, which means the output will be an integer between 3 and 10^18 + 2 (exclusive).

Output: **an integer between 3 and 10^18 + 2 (exclusive)**
