Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b`, the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a`. Otherwise, the program prints the integer division of `m` by `a` plus the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 2.***
