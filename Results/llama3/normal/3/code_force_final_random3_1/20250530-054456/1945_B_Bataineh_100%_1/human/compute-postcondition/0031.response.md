Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-2` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b` is printed. If `m` is between `a` and `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` is printed. Otherwise, `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.***
