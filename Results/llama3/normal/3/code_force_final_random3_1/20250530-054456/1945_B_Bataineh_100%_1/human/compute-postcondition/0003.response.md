Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). The current value of `m` is less than both the current value of `a` and the current value of `b`.***
