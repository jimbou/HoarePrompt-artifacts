Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). Either `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the value of 2 + m // b is printed. If `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not greater than `b`, then if `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`, the value of 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` is printed.***
