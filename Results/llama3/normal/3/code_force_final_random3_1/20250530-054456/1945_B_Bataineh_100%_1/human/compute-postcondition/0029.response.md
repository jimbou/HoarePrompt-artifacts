Output: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-2` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), and this is printed: m // a + m // b + 2 where m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and b is an integer between 1 and 10^18**
