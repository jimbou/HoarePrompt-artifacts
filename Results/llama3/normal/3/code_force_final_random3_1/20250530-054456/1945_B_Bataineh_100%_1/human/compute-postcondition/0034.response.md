Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the next set of three space-separated integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^18. The stdin now contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), since one set has been consumed by the input operation.
