Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and are the last line of input from stdin, stdin is empty. If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` < `b` and `b` > `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `t-1`, and `a`, `b`, `c` are the last line of input from stdin. The stdin is empty because all the lines have been processed. The output is determined by the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` in the last iteration, and it can be 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions in the loop.
