Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input is "3 2 1". According to the problem description, this should output "NONE", but the program outputs "PEAK". This is because the condition `a < b > c` is not sufficient to determine a peak, as it does not check if `b` is greater than `c`. A correct implementation would be `a < b and b > c`.
