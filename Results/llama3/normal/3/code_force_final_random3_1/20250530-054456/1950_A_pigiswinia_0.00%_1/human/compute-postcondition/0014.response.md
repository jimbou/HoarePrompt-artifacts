Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` but `b` is not less than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed if `b` is greater than `c`. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
