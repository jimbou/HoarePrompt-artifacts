Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and are the second line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-4` lines each containing three digits (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9). If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` < `b` and `b` > `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `i` is still 2, and `a`, `b`, `c` are now assigned the values of the three integers from the second line of input from stdin. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines of input. The conditions for printing 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still valid based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
