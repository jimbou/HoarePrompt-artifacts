Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The condition (a < b < c) is not met. The current value of `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, and 'PEAK' is printed**
