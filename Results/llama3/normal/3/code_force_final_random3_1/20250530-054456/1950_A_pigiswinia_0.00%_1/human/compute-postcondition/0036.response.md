Functionality: **This function reads a series of inputs from the standard input, where the first input is the number of test cases (t), followed by t lines each containing three digits (a, b, c). It then classifies each set of three digits into one of three categories: 'STAIRS' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b > c, or 'NONE' otherwise. The classification result is printed to the standard output for each set of three digits. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to provide a classification output based on the input values.**
