The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and are the second line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-3` lines each containing three digits (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9). If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` < `b` and `b` > `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
