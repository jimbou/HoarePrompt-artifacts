According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
