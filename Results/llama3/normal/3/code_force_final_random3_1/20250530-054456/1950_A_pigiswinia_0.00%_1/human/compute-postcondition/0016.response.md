Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and are the first line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-3` lines each containing three digits (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to be the first line of input from stdin, which contains three digits between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing three digits.
