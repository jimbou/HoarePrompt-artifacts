Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and are the first line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-3` lines each containing three digits (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9). If `a` < `b` < `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` < `b` and `b` > `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
