Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This is because the program is not correctly implementing the strategy to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The correct strategy is to place the cells in a way that maximizes the number of different Manhattan distances between pairs of cells. The program's current implementation does not achieve this.

For instance, when n = 3, the program places the cells at (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3), which results in a set of Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2}. However, the correct placement of cells at (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1) results in a set of Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3}, which is larger.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
