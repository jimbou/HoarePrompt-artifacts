Based on the precondition, the code will print the numbers 1 and 1.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The print statement is `print(1, 1)`.
* The values to be printed are explicitly specified as 1 and 1.
* There are no variables or objects involved in this print statement.
* The precondition provides information about the state of the program, including the values of `i` and `n`, but these values are not used in the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be the two numbers 1 and 1, separated by a space.

Output: **1 1**
