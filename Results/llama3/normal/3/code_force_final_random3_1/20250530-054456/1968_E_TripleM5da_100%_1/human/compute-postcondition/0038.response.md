The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 52 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 3.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2**
