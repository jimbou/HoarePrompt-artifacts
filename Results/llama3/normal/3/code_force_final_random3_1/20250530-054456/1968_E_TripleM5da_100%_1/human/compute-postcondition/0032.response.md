The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 51, `n` is at least 50. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 52 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 52.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 53, `i` is 52**
