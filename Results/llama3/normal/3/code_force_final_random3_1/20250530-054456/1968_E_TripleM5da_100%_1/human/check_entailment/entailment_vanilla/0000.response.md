Reasoning:

The problem asks to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

However, the program has a logical error. It always prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints the points (i, i) for i from 3 to n. This does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the optimal arrangement for n = 3 is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which gives a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
