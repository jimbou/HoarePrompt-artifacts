Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers n. For each n, it prints a sequence of pairs starting from (1, 1) and (1, 2), followed by pairs (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n. The function repeats this process t times, consuming all input from standard input and producing a specific output pattern.**
