Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 50), stdin contains one input: a list of n integers (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ..., n, n.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be one more than the value of `n`, and the value of `n` will remain the same as in the initial state. The input in stdin will also remain the same. The output will include the initial print statements "1, 2" followed by the print statements inside the loop, which will print each number from 3 to `n` twice.
