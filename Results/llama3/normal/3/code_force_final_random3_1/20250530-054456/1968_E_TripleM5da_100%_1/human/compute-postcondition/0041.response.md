The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 4, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed twice**
