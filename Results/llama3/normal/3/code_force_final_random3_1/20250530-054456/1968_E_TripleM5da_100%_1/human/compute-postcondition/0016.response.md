The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `stdin`. If `i` is less than `int(stdin)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 50), stdin contains one input: a list of n integers (2 <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is `n + 2` and stdin contains one input: a list of n + 1 integers (2 <= n + 1 <= 10^3).
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 50), stdin contains one input: a list of n + 1 integers (2 <= n + 1 <= 10^3)**
