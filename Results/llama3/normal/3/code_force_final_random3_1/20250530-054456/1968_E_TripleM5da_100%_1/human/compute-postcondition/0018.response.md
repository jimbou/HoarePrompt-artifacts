Based on the initial state, the variable `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and the variable `i` is equal to `n + 2`.

The print statement `print(1, 1)` does not depend on the values of `n` or `i`. It simply prints the values 1 and 1, separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 1**
