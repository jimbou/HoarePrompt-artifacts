According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 50), `i` is `n + 2`, and the numbers 1 and 1 are being printed, and this is printed: 1, 2. So for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 3 and `i` is 3.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3**
