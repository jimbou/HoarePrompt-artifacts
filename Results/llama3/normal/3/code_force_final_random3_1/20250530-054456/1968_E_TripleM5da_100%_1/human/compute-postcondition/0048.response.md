Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 50), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ..., n, n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `n + 1`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The standard input `stdin` is empty, and the output consists of a sequence of numbers where each number from 1 to `n` is printed twice.
