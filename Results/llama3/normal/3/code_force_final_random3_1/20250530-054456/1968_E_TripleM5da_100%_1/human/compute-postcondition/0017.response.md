The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts a list of `n + 1` integers and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains a list of `n + 1` integers. The value of `i` is `n + 2`, but the value of `n` is updated, so the value of `i` is also updated to `n + 2`, where `n` is the new value. The value of `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 50). The stdin now contains no input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 50), `i` is `n + 2`.**
