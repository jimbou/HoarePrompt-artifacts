To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from 3 to `n` (inclusive).

The current state is:
- `n` is an integer that must be at least 5
- `i` is 4
- This is printed: 4, 4 (this information is not relevant to the loop head, so we can ignore it)

To determine the next state, we need to consider what values `i` and `n` can take for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` is currently 4, it will be incremented to 5 at the start of the next iteration.

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` will be 5, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `i` is 5**
