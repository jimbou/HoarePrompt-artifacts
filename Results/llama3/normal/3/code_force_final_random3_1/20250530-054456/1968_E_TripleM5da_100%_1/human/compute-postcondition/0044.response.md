The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `i` is 5, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 4 is printed twice**
