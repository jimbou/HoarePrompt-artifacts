Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 52, `i` is 52, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 4 is printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 5 is printed twice, and so on until the value of `i` which is 52 is printed twice.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` must be at least 52, the value of `i` is 52, there is no input in stdin, and the numbers 1 and 2 are printed, followed by the numbers 3 to 52, each printed twice.
