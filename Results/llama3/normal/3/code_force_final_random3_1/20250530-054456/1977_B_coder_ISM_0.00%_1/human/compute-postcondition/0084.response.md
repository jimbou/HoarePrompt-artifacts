Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is less than 31, and `s` is a list that has been printed. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, `s` contains one more element '1' at the end. Otherwise, `s` contains an additional element '0' at the end.***
