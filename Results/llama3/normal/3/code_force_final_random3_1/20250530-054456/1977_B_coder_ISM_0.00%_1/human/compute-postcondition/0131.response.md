Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= `x` < 2^30), `i` is 1, `s` is a list that has been printed, the list `s` contains 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x`, and the binary representation of `x` is printed. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[30]` is '1', and if the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then either the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or the current value of `s[i]` is not '1'. If the current value of `s[i]` is '-1', then the current value of `s[i + 1]` is '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '1', then the current value of `s[29]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0, then the current value of `s[i]` is either not equal to `s[i + 1]` or not '1'. Either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. The current value of `s[i]` is '-1' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '1'.***
