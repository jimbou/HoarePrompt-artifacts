The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 30, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 31. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 30. So, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is less than 30, and `s` is a list that has been printed. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, `s` contains one more element '1' at the end. Otherwise, `s` contains an additional element '0' at the end.**
