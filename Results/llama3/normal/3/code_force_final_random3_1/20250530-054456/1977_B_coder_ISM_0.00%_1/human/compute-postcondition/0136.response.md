Postcondition: **The program has processed the binary representation of a positive integer `x` less than 2^30, where `x` is represented by a list `s` containing 30 or 31 elements, each being '1', '0', or '-1'. If the current element `s[i]` is '-1' and the previous element `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is updated to '0' and `s[i - 1]` is updated to '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the list `s`. The program maintains the integrity of the binary representation, ensuring that if `s[i]` is '-1', the next element `s[i + 1]` is '1', and if `s[i]` is '0', either the next element `s[i + 1]` is not '0' or `s[i]` is not '1'. The program also ensures that if `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, and `s[30]` is '1'.**
