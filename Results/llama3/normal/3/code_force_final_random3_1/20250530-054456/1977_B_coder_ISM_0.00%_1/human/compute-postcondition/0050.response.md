Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 29, flag is 0, the list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final state. The value of `t` remains between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is still 0, `x` is still a positive integer less than 2^30, and `length` is still 30. The `stdin` still contains `t-1` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30). The loop counter `i` has reached its final value of 29. The flag `flag` has been reset to 0. The list `s` still contains a string '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list `s`. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`. The list `s` has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`, and the list `s` is printed.
