Output State: **`i` is 30, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements: each element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the elements of the list `s` are being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` continues to contain 30 elements, each representing the bit value of `x` at position `i`, and its elements are still being printed.
