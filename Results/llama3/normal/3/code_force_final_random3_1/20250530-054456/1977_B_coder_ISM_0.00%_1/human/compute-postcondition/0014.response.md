Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is 2, The list `s` contains a string '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list `s`. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`. The list `s` has an additional '1' appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `s` now has an additional '1' appended to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
