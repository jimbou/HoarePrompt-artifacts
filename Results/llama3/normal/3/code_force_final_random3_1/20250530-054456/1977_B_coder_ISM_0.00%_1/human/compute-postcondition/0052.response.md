Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is 29, the list `s` contains a string '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list `s`. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`. The list `s` has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`, and the list `s` is printed. The current value of `flag` is 1 and the current value of `s[29]` is '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s[29]` has been updated to '1', while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still contains the binary representation of `x` with an additional '1' or '0' appended to it based on the bit at position `i`, and the list `s` is printed. The value of `flag` is still 1.
