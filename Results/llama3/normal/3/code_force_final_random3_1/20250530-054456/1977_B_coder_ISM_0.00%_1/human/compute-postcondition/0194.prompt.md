Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 30, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements: each element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the elements of the list `s` are being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is less than 29, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '-1' and `s[i+1]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is 1, then the element at index `i` in the list `s` is set to '0'. If `flag` is not 1 and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not '1', then the element at index `i` in the list `s` remains unchanged. Each element in the list `s` is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the elements of the list `s` are being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is less than 30, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is '0', then the element at index `i` of `s` is updated to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is not '0' but `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then the element at index `i` of `s` is updated to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is not '0' and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not '1', then `flag` remains true. If `flag` is false, then no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is greater than the previous value and less than 29, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is '0', then the element at index `i` of `s` is changed to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is not '0', or if `flag` is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, if `flag` is 0 and the element at index `i` of `s` is '1' and the element at index `i` of `s` is the same as the element at index `i+1`, then the element at index `i` of `s` is changed to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
