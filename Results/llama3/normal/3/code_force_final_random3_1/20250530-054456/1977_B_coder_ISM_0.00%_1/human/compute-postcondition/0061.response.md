Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 1, The list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', an extra '1' is appended to the end of the list s. Otherwise, the list s is printed as it is. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'.***
