Output State: **i is 30, t is greater than 30, nalla is 31, x is an integer, length is at least 31, s contains either 30 or 31 elements, s[i] is '0', and s[i - 1] is '-1'.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]`. Initially, `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1'. After the first line executes, `s[i]` becomes '0'. Then, the second line changes `s[i - 1]` to '-1'. The values of `i`, `t`, `nalla`, `x`, and `length` remain unchanged. The length of `s` also remains the same, with either 30 or 31 elements.
