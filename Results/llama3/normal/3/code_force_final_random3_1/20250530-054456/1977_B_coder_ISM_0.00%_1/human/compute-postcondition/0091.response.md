Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 30, and s is a list that has been printed. The list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed**
