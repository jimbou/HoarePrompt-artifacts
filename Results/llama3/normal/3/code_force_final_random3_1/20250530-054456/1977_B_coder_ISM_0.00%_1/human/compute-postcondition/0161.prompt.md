Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 30, t is greater than 30, nalla is 31, x is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, flag is unchanged, s is an empty list, length is 30
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is less than 30, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, flag is unchanged, length is 30. The list `s` contains a single element: '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is non-zero), otherwise '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is less than 31, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, flag is unchanged, length is 30. The list `s` contains two elements: the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the second element is '1' if the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is non-zero, otherwise '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is less than 32, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, flag is unchanged, length is 30. The list `s` contains three elements: the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', the second element is '1' if the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is non-zero, otherwise '0', and the third element is '1' if the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is non-zero, otherwise '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
