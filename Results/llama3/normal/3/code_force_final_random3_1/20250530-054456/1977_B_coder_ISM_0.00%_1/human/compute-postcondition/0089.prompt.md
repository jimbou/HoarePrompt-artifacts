Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 29, s is an empty list, the list s is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is less than 30, and `s` is a list that has been printed. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, `s` contains one element '1' at the end. Otherwise, `s` contains a single element '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is less than 31, and `s` is a list that has been printed. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, `s` contains one more element '1' at the end. Otherwise, `s` contains an additional element '0' at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is less than 30, and `s` is a list that has been printed. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, `s` contains one more element '1' at the end. Otherwise, `s` contains an additional element '0' at the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
