Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 30, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is '0', then the element at index `i` of `s` is updated to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is not '0' but `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then the element at index `i` of `s` is updated to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is not '0' and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not '1', then `flag` remains true. If `flag` is false, then no changes are made to the variables.***
