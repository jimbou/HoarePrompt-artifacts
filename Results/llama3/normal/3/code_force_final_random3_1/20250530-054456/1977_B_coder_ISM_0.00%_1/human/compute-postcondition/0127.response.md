Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 31, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 29, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed. The current value of flag is 1. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then either the current value of s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1] or the current value of s[i] is not '1'. If the current value of s[i] is '-1', then the current value of s[i + 1] is '1'. s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1'.**

The first line assigns the value '0' to s[29]. The second line appends '1' to the end of the list s. The third line increments the value of length by 1. The value of t, nalla, x, i, and flag remains unchanged. The list s now contains 31 elements, with the last two elements being '0' and '1'. The binary representation of x is still printed, and the conditions regarding the values of s[i] and s[i+1] remain valid.
