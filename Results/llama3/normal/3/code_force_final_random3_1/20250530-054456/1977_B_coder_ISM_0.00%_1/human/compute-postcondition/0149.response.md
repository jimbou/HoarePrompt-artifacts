Output State: **`i` is less than 30, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, flag is unchanged, `s` is a list containing the string '1', length is 30. The current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is non-zero).**

In this output state, the value of `s` has changed to a list containing the string '1', which was appended to the initially empty list. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `i`, `t`, `nalla`, `x`, and `length` are still valid.
