Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 0, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed, flag is 1, the current value of s[i] is '-1', and the current value of s[i + 1] is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of flag has been updated to 1, and the value of s[i] has been updated to '-1'. All other variables remain unchanged.
