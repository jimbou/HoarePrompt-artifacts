Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `s` is an empty list, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is 0. The current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true).***
