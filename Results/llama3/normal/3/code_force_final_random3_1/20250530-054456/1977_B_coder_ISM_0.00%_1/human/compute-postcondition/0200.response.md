Postcondition: ***`i` is 29, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is either 30 or 31, and the list `s` contains either 30 or 31 elements. If `flag` is true, then `s` contains 31 elements, with `s[29]` being '0' and the last element being '1'. If `flag` is false, then `s` contains 30 elements and either `flag` is false or the element at index `i` of `s` is not '0'.***
