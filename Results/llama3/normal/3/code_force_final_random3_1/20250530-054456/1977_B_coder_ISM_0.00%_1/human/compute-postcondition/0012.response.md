Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is 1. The list `s` contains a string '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list `s`. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`.***
