The `print(*s)` statement will print the elements of the list `s`, which contains the binary representation of the positive integer `x`. Since `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, its binary representation will have at most 30 bits.

The list `s` has 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary digits of `x`. The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the list `s` into separate arguments, so the elements of `s` will be printed separated by spaces.

Output: **The binary representation of x, with each bit printed separately, using 30 '1's and '0's (where x is the positive integer less than 2^30)**
