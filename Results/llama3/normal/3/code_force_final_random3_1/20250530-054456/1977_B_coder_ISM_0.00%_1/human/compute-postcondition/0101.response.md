Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, stdin contains t-3 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is 0, `s` is a list that has been printed, the list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed, the current value of `s[i]` is '0', the current value of `flag` is 1, and either the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or the current value of `s[i]` is not '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `s[i]` has been updated to '0'. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 positive integers x because one integer has been used to print the binary representation of x. The list `s` still contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is still printed. The current value of `flag` is still 1, and the condition that either the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or the current value of `s[i]` is not '1' is still satisfied.
