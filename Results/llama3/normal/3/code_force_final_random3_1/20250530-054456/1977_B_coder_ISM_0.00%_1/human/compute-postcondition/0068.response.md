Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 29, The list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', an extra '1' is appended to the end of the list s. Otherwise, the list s is printed as it is. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. s[i] is '0', s[i - 1] is '-1'.**

The loop executes until i is equal to length - 1, which is 29. After the loop finishes executing, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The value of i is now 29, and the list s contains the binary representation of x with an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', an extra '1' is appended to the end of the list s. Otherwise, the list s is printed as it is.
