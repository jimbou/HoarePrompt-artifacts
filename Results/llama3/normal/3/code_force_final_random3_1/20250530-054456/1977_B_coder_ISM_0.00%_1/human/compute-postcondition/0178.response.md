The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 29, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 29. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`i` is less than 30, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements.**
