Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 30, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed, flag is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 0, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed. If flag is 0, then the current value of s[i] is either not equal to s[i + 1] or not '1'. If flag is 1, then either the current value of s[i] is '0' and either the current value of s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1] or the current value of s[i] is not '1', or the current value of s[i] is '-1' and the current value of s[i + 1] is '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= `x` < 2^30), `i` is 1, `s` is a list that has been printed, the list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x`, and the binary representation of `x` is printed. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[1]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 2, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed. If flag is 0 and s[2] is '1' and s[2] is equal to s[3], then s[2] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1 and s[2] is '0', then s[2] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[2] is '1', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If flag is 0 and the condition is not met, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
