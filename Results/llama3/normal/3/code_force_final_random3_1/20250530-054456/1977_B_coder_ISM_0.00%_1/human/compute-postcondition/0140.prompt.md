Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30 or 31, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 29, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then length is 31, s[30] is '1', and if the current value of s[i] is '0', then either the current value of s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1] or the current value of s[i] is not '1'. If the current value of s[i] is '-1', then the current value of s[i + 1] is '1'. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', then the current value of s[29] is '1'. If flag is 0, then the current value of s[i] is either not equal to s[i + 1] or not '1'. Either flag is 0 or s[29] is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= `x` < 2^30), `i` is 1, `s` is a list that has been printed, the list `s` contains 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x`, and the binary representation of `x` is printed. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[30]` is '1', and if the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then either the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or the current value of `s[i]` is not '1'. If the current value of `s[i]` is '-1', then the current value of `s[i + 1]` is '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '1', then the current value of `s[29]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0, then the current value of `s[i]` is either not equal to `s[i + 1]` or not '1'. Either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the current value of `s[i]` is '0' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '-1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program has processed the binary representation of a positive integer `x` less than 2^30, where `x` is represented by a list `s` containing 30 or 31 elements, each being '1', '0', or '-1'. If the current element `s[i]` is '-1' and the previous element `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is updated to '0' and `s[i - 1]` is updated to '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the list `s`. The program maintains the integrity of the binary representation, ensuring that if `s[i]` is '-1', the next element `s[i + 1]` is '1', and if `s[i]` is '0', either the next element `s[i + 1]` is not '0' or `s[i]` is not '1'. The program also ensures that if `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, and `s[30]` is '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements, each being '1', '0', or '-1', `i` is the current index plus 1, `length` is greater than `i`. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '0' and `s[i - 1]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
