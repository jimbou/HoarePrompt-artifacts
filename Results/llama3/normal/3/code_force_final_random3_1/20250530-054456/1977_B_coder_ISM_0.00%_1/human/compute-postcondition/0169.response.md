Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 29, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements: each element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is set to '1'. The current value of `flag` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '1' and is equal to `s[i + 1]`.***
