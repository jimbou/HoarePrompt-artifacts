Output State: **`i` is less than 32, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, flag is unchanged, length is 30. The list `s` contains three elements: the first two elements are: the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the second element is '1' if the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is non-zero, otherwise '0', and the third element is '0'.**

In this output state, the list `s` now contains three elements. The first two elements are determined by the value of `x` and the position `i`, as before. The third element is always '0', as it was appended by the code. The other variables remain unchanged.
