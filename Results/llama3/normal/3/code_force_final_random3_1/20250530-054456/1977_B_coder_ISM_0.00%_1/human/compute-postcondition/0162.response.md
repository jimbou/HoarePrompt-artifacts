The `print(*s)` statement will print the elements of the list `s` as separate values, without any separator or formatting.

Based on the initial state, the list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', depending on whether the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`.

Since `i` is 30, and `x` is an integer, we can infer that `x` is a 30-bit integer. The list `s` represents the binary representation of `x`, with each element corresponding to a bit in the binary representation.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of 30 '1's and '0's, representing the binary representation of the value of `x`.

Output: **a sequence of 30 '1's and '0's, representing the binary representation of the value of x**
