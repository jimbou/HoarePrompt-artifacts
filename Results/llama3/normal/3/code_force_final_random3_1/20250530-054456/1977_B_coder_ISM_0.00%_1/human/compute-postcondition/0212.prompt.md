Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 29, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, and `length` is either 30 or 31. The list `s` contains either 30 or 31 elements. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is '0', then the element at index `i` of `s` is updated to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is true and the element at index `i` of `s` is not '0', then `s` contains 31 elements, with `s[29]` being '0' and the last element being '1'. If `flag` is false, then `s` contains 30 elements and either `flag` is false or the element at index `i` of `s` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is 29, t is greater than 30, nalla is 31, x is an integer, length is at least 2, and s contains either 30 or 31 elements. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *i is 30, t is greater than 30, nalla is 31, x is an integer, length is at least 31, and s contains either 30 or 31 elements. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 31, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is at least 31, and `s` contains either 30 or 31 elements. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
