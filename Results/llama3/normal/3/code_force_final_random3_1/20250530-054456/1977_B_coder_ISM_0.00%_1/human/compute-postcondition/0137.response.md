To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `length`. The loop condition is `i < length`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `length` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements, each being '1', '0', or '-1', `i` is the current index plus 1, `length` is greater than `i`**
