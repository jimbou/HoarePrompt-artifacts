Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 30, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, flag is unchanged, length is 30. The list `s` contains a single element: '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is non-zero), otherwise '0'.***
