Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is 1. The list `s` contains a string '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise it contains '0', and an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, and the list `s` has an additional '0' appended to its end. The stdin still contains t-1 positive integers x, and the other variables remain unchanged.
