The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 29, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= `x` < 2^30), `i` is 1, `s` is a list that has been printed, the list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x`, and the binary representation of `x` is printed. If `flag` is 0, then the current value of `s[i]` is either not equal to `s[i + 1]` or not '1'. If `flag` is 1, then either the current value of `s[i]` is '0' and either the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or the current value of `s[i]` is not '1', or the current value of `s[i]` is '-1' and the current value of `s[i + 1]` is '1'.**
