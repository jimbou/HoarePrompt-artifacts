Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30)
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 29, The list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', an extra '1' is appended to the end of the list s. Otherwise, the list s is printed as it is. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. s[i] is '0', s[i - 1] is '-1', and the length which is equal to 30 is being printed, and the list s is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has finished executing, and the list `s` has been updated according to the rules specified in the loop body. The value of `i` is now equal to `length`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list. The state of the other variables, such as `t`, `nalla`, `x`, `stdin`, and `flag`, remains unchanged, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 30, t is greater than 30, nalla is 31, x is an integer, length is 31, and s contains 31 elements. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged, and the length which is equal to 31 is being printed, and the elements of the list s are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
