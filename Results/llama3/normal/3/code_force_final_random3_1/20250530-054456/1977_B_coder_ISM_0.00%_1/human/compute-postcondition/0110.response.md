Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= `x` < 2^30), `i` is 1, `s` is a list that has been printed, the list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x`, and the binary representation of `x` is printed. `s[i]` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is still 1, `x` is still a positive integer less than 2^30, and `length` is still 30. The stdin still contains `t-2` positive integers `x`. The value of `i` is still 1. The list `s` has been printed and still contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x`. However, the value of `s[i]` has been changed to '0'.
