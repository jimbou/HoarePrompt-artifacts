Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is at least 0 and less than 29. The list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then the current value of flag is 0 and the current value of s[i] is '1'. Additionally, either flag is not 0, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'. If flag is 0, then either s[i] is '1', or s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is '1'.***
