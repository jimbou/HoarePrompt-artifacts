Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `s` is a list containing '0', `length` is 30, `stdin` contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is 0. The bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the string '0' as its first element, while the other variables remain unchanged. The bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is still 0, and the stdin still contains t-1 positive integers x.
