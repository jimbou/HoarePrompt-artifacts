Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is less than 30, `s` is a list that has been printed and is currently empty. The current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is true).**
