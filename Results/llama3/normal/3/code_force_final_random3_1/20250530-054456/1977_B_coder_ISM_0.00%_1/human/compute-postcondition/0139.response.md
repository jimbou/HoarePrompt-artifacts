Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements, each being '1', '0', or '-1', `i` is the current index plus 1, `length` is greater than `i`. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '0' and `s[i - 1]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.***
