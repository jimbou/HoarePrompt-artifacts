Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 29, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `flag` is not 0, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements: each element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. The current value of `flag` is not 0 and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'***
