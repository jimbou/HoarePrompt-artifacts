Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 2, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed. If flag is 0 and s[2] is '1' and s[2] is equal to s[3], then s[2] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1 and s[2] is '0', then s[2] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[2] is '1', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If flag is 0 and the condition is not met, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
