Output: **i is 30, t is greater than 30, nalla is 31, x is an integer, length is 31, and s contains 31 elements. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged, and the length which is equal to 31 is being printed, and the elements of the list s are being printed**
