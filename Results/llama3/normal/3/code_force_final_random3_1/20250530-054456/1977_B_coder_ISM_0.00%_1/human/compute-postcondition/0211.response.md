Postcondition: ***`i` is 31, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is at least 31, and `s` contains either 30 or 31 elements. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.***
