Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 29, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, and the list `s` contains 30 elements. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '-1' and `s[i+1]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is 1, then the element at index `i` in the list `s` is set to '0'. If `flag` is not 1 and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not '1', then the element at index `i` in the list `s` remains unchanged. Each element in the list `s` is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the elements of the list `s` are being printed.***
