Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find a valid array of integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} for a given positive integer x, as described in the problem statement. The program first converts the input integer to its binary representation, then checks for consecutive '1' bits and replaces them with '-1' and '0' bits, and finally appends an extra '1' bit if necessary. The program also correctly handles the case where the last bit is '0' and the flag is 1. The output of the program matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
