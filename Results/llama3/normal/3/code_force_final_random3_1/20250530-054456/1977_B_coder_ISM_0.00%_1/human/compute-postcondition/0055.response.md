Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 31, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 29, the list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed. The current value of flag is 1, s[29] is '0', and an extra '1' is appended to the end of the list s.**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `nalla` also remains 0, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `x` remains a positive integer less than 2^30, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `length` is incremented by 1, making it 31. The value of `i` remains 29, as it is not modified by the code. The list `s` is modified by the code, with `s[29]` being set to '0' and an extra '1' being appended to the end of the list. The value of `flag` remains 1, as it is not modified by the code.
