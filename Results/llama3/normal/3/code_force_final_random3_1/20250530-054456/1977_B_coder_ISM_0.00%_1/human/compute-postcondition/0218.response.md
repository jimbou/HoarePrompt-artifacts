Functionality: **This function reads a series of positive integers from standard input, converts each integer to its binary representation, and then performs a series of operations on the binary representation. For each binary representation, it checks for consecutive '1' bits and replaces them with '-1' and '0' bits, then appends an extra '1' bit if the last bit is '0' and the flag is 1. Finally, it prints the modified binary representation and its length. The function repeats this process for each input integer.**
