Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 2, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed. s[2] is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of s[i] has been updated to '0', where i is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list s still contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is still printed.
