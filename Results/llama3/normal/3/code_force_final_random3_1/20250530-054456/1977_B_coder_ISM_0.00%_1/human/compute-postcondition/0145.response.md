The only variable in the loop head is variable  `nalla` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nalla` and `t`. If `nalla` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nalla` is equal to `length` and `length` is equal to `t`. For the loop to execute again `nalla` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than `length`. 
State: **`i` is equal to `length`, `t` is greater than `length`, `nalla` is equal to `length` + 1, `x` is unchanged, `stdin` is unchanged, `flag` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged**
