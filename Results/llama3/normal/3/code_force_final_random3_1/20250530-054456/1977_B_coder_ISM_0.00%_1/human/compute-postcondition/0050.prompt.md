Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is 29, `flag` is 0, the list `s` contains a string '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list `s`. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`. The list `s` has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list `s`, and the list `s` is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is at least 0 and less than 29. The list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then the current value of flag is 0 and the current value of s[i] is '1'. If flag is 0, s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], and s[i] is '1', then the value of s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, either flag is not 0, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is at least 1 and less than 30. The list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then the current value of flag is 0 and the current value of s[i] is '1'. If flag is 0, s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], and s[i] is '1', then the value of s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, either flag is not 0, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, either flag is 0, or s[i] is not '0'. If flag is 0, s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then the value of s[i] is now '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-1 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is at least 2 and less than 30. The list s contains a string '1' if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise it contains '0'. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, an additional '1' is appended to the list s. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 0, an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s. The list s has an additional '1' appended to it if the bit at position i in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise an extra '0' is appended to the end of the list s, and the list s is printed. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then the current value of flag is 0 and the current value of s[i] is '1'. If flag is 0, s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], and s[i] is '1', then the value of s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, either flag is not 0, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, either flag is 0, or s[i] is not '0'. If flag is 0, s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then the value of s[i] is now '0'. s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. s[i] is now '0'. If flag is 1, then the value of s[i] is now '0' and we pass the current control flow to the next statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables do not change but we pass the current control flow to the next statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
