Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find an array of integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} that satisfies the given conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and initializes an empty list `s`.
3. It then iterates over the bits of `x` from least significant to most significant (i.e., from `2^0` to `2^29`). For each bit, it appends a string '1' to `s` if the bit is 1, and a string '0' otherwise.
4. After constructing the binary representation of `x` in `s`, it applies the following transformations to ensure that there are no consecutive non-zero elements:
	* If two consecutive elements are both 1, it changes the first one to -1 and the second one to 0.
	* If a 1 is followed by a 0, it changes the 0 to 1.
	* If a -1 is followed by a 1, it swaps them.
5. Finally, it prints the length of the transformed list `s` and the list itself.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `x` is a power of 2 or has only one bit set.

Correctness: **True**
