Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30), `i` is less than 30, `s` is a list that has been printed and currently contains one element '1' at the end. The current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is true).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is still 1, `x` is still a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is still 30, `stdin` still contains `t-2` positive integers `x`, `i` is still less than 30, and `s` is a list that has been printed and now contains one element '1' at the end. The current value of `x` still has a bit set at position `i`.
