Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer less than 2^30, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 positive integers x (1 <= x < 2^30), i is 29, s is a list that has been printed, the list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of x, and the binary representation of x is printed. If flag is 0, then the current value of s[i] is either not equal to s[i + 1] or not '1'. If flag is 1, then either the current value of s[i] is '0' and either the current value of s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1] or the current value of s[i] is not '1', or the current value of s[i] is '-1' and the current value of s[i + 1] is '1'. Additionally, the current value of flag is 1 and the current value of s[29] is '0'.**
