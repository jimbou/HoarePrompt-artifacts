Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer less than 2^30, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` positive integers `x` (1 <= `x` < 2^30), `i` is 1, `s` is a list that has been printed, the list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x`, and the binary representation of `x` is printed. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
