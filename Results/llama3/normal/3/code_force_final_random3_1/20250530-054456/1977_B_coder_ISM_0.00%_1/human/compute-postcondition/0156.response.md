Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 31, `t` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `x` is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs, flag is unchanged, length is 30. The list `s` contains two elements: the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`, otherwise '0', and the second element is '1' if the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is non-zero, otherwise '0'.***
