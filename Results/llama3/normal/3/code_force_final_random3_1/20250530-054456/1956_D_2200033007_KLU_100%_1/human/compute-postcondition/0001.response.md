To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Since `i` is already a non-negative integer, we can conclude that `i` is at least 0. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `j` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is True, `j` is 0**
