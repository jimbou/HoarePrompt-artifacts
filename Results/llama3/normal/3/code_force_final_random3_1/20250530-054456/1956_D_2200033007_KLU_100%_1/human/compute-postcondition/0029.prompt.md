Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers with an additional tuple (start_index, start_index + i), j is i - 1, and there exists a j in the range from 0 to i - 1 (inclusive) such that arr[start_index + j] is equal to j. Additionally, arr[start_index + i] is not equal to i.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
    arr[j] = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `start_index`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements, and `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `start_index + i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements, `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i - 1`, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `start_index + i + 1`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements, `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i - 1`, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
