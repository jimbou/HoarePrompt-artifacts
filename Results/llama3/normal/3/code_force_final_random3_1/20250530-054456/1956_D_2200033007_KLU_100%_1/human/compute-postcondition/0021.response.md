Postcondition: ***`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is `i`, and there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i` (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`. Additionally, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.***
