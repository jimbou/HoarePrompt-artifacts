Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation to maximize the sum of the elements of the array. The problem description states that the operation can be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times, but the program does not keep track of the number of operations performed. 

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum sum is achieved by not performing any operations. In this case, the program should return 0 as the number of operations, but it does not.

For example, if the input is [1, 3, 9], the program should return 13 0, but it does not. 

The program also does not correctly handle the case where the maximum sum is achieved by performing operations that do not change the array. In this case, the program should return the correct number of operations, but it does not.

For example, if the input is [1, 100, 2, 1], the program should return 105 2, but it does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
