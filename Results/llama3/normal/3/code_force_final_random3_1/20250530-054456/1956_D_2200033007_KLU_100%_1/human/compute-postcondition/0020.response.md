Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is `i-1`, and there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1` (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`. The current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called and returned.**

In this output state, the value of `i` is still a positive integer, but the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, which means that the value of `i` has been decremented by 1 in the function call. The value of `j` is now `i-1`, and the range of `j` has been updated to be from 0 to `i-1` (inclusive). The value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is now equal to `i-1`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has returned, which means that its execution has been completed.
