This function takes two non-negative integers, start_index and end_index, as input, where 0 <= start_index <= end_index < len(arr). It calculates the maximum value within the given range using func_1 and determines the length of the range. If the length is 1 and the value at start_index is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list. If the length is more than 1 and the square of the length equals the maximum value, it returns a list containing a tuple of start_index and end_index. Otherwise, it iterates through the range, calculates a temporary result using func_1 and arr[i], and returns the sum of the results of func_2 for the sub-ranges if the temporary result equals the maximum value. If no such result is found, the function does not return any value.
