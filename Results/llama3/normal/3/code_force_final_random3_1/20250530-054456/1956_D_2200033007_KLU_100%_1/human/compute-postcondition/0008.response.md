To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. To execute the loop again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables in the loop head are `i`, which is a positive integer, and `arr`, which is a list of integers. However, the loop condition only depends on `j` and `i`, so we don't need to adjust the state of `arr`.

The other variables `start_index`, `res`, and `is_already_stairs` are not part of the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is 2. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
