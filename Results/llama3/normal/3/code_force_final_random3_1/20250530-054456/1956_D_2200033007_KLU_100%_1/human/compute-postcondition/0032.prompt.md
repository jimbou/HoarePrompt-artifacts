You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, and res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers.
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is `i`, and `is_already_stairs` is False if there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i` (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`; otherwise, `is_already_stairs` is True.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing because there is no return statement with a value.
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is `i`, and there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i` (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement in the given code snippet.
    #State: *`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is `i`, and there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i` (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: i is 0, j is equal to start_index + i, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, arr has at least i + 1 elements, and arr[j] is equal to i.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is either `i-1` or `start_index + i`. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then `i` is a positive integer, `j` is `i-1`, and there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1` (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`. The current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called and returned. Otherwise, `i` is -1, `j` is equal to `start_index + i`, `arr` has at least `i` + 1 elements, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`, which is -2, and its return value has been returned.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing because there is no return statement with a value.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement in the given code snippet.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
