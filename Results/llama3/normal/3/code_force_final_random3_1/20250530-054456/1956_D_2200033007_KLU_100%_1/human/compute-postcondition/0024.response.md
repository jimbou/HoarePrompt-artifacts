The value of `arr[j]` is updated to `i`, where `j` is equal to `start_index`. The value of `i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`. The length of `arr` is at least `i + 1` elements. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `start_index`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements, and `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i`.**
