Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is 2, `is_already_stairs` is False**

The code sets the value of `is_already_stairs` to False, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `start_index` is within the valid range for the given `i` and `arr` still holds. The list `res` still contains tuples of non-negative integers. The value of `j` remains 2.
