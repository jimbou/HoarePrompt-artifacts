Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` is equal to `start_index + i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(arr) - `i` - 1, `arr` has at least `i` + 1 elements, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`, which is -2, and its return value has been returned.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been decremented by 1, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`, which is -2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the function call has returned a value.
