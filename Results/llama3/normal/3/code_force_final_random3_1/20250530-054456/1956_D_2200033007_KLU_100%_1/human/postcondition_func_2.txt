The function modifies the input list `arr` by creating a staircase pattern starting from the `start_index` and appends the start and end indices of the staircase to the `res` list. If the input list already has a staircase pattern at the specified position, the function does nothing. The function recursively calls itself to create the staircase pattern, and in each recursive call, it checks if the current element in the list matches the expected value in the staircase pattern. If it does, the function continues to the next recursive call. If it doesn't, the function modifies the list to create the staircase pattern and appends the start and end indices to the `res` list. The function returns nothing.
