Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is `i`, and `is_already_stairs` is False if there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i` (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`; otherwise, `is_already_stairs` is True.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables remains largely unchanged except for `j` and `is_already_stairs`. The variable `j` will have reached the value of `i`, as it iterates from 0 to `i` (inclusive). The variable `is_already_stairs` will be set to False if at any point during the loop's execution, the value of `arr` at the index `start_index + j` is not equal to `j`. If no such mismatch is found throughout the loop's execution, `is_already_stairs` will remain True.
