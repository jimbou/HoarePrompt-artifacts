Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r, computing the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray from l to r, and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.

The program uses a recursive approach with memoization to calculate the maximum sum that can be obtained from a subarray within a given range. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum value that can be obtained from a subarray, and the function `func_2` generates the sequence of operations to achieve this maximum value.

The program correctly handles the base cases, such as when the subarray has only one element or when the maximum value is equal to the length of the subarray squared. It also correctly handles the recursive cases, where it divides the subarray into two parts and calculates the maximum value for each part.

The program also correctly generates the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum value. It uses the `make_stairs` function to create a staircase pattern in the array, which is necessary to achieve the maximum value.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and generates the correct sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

Correctness: **True**
