Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is either `i-1` or `start_index + i`. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then `i` is a positive integer, `j` is `i-1`, and there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1` (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`. The current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called and returned. Otherwise, `i` is -1, `j` is equal to `start_index + i`, `arr` has at least `i` + 1 elements, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`, which is -2, and its return value has been returned.***
