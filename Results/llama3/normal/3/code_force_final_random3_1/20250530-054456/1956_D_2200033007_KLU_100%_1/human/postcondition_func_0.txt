This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained from a subarray within a given range (start_index to end_index) in a list of non-negative integers. It uses memoization to store previously computed results in a dictionary (res_dict) to avoid redundant calculations. The function returns the maximum value among four options: the length of the subarray, the sum of the subarray divided at a certain point, and the sum of the value at the start or end index and the remaining subarray. If the subarray has only one element, it returns the maximum value between 1 and the value of that element. If the result for the given range is already in the dictionary, it returns the stored value.
