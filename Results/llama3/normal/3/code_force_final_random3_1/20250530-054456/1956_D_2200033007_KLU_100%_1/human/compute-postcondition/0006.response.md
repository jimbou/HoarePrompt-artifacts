Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is 1, `is_already_stairs` is False**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `is_already_stairs` which is assigned the value False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
