Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, computing x as MEX({a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}), and simultaneously setting a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, ..., a_r:=x.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and make_stairs. 

func_1 calculates the maximum value that can be obtained from a subarray within a given range (start_index to end_index) in a list of non-negative integers. It uses memoization to store previously computed results in a dictionary (res_dict) to avoid redundant calculations.

func_2 takes two non-negative integers, start_index and end_index, as input, where 0 ≤ start_index ≤ end_index < len(arr). It calculates the maximum value within the given range using func_1 and determines the length of the range. If the length is 1 and the value at start_index is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list. If the length is more than 1 and the square of the length equals the maximum value, it returns a list containing a tuple of start_index and end_index. Otherwise, it iterates through the range, calculates a temporary result using func_1 and arr[i], and returns the sum of the results of func_2 for the sub-ranges if the temporary result equals the maximum value.

make_stairs modifies the input list `arr` by creating a staircase pattern starting from the `start_index` and appends the start and end indices of the staircase to the `res` list. If the input list already has a staircase pattern at the specified position, the function does nothing.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls func_1 and func_2, and prints the results.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program seems to be correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of elements in the array and constructs a sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The use of memoization in func_1 avoids redundant calculations and improves the efficiency of the program. The program also correctly handles the base cases and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
