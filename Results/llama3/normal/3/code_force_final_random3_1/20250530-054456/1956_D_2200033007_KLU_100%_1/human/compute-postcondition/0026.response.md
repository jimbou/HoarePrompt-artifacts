Output State: **`i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `start_index + i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements, `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i - 1`, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[j]` has been updated to `i`, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The relationship between `j` and `start_index` and `i` is still valid, and the constraints on `start_index` and the length of `arr` are still satisfied. The value of `arr[start_index]` is still `i - 1`.
