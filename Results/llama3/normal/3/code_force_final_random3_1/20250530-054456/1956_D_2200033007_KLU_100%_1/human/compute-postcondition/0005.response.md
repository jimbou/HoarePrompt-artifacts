The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `i + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `i` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than 0.
State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is 1**
