Output State: **i is 0, arr is a list of integers where the element at index start_index is 1, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers where the last element is (start_index, start_index), j is 0, and there exists a j in the range from 0 to 0 (inclusive) such that arr[start_index + j] is equal to j**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The list `arr` has been modified such that the element at index `start_index` is now 1. The value of `start_index` remains the same, within the valid range. The list `res` has been appended with a new tuple containing the value of `start_index` twice. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 0. The condition that there exists a `j` in the range from 0 to 0 (inclusive) such that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j` is still satisfied, as `arr[start_index]` is now 1, which is equal to `j` (0).
