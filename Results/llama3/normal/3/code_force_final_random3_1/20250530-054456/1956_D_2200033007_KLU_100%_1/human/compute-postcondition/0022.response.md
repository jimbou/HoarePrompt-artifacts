Output State: **i is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers with an additional tuple (start_index, start_index + i), j is i - 1, and there exists a j in the range from 0 to i - 1 (inclusive) such that arr[start_index + j] is equal to j. Additionally, arr[start_index + i] is not equal to i.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, and a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` has been appended to the list `res`. The value of `j` has also been updated to `i - 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `start_index`, `arr`, and `j` have been updated to reflect the new value of `i`.
