Output State: **`i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `start_index + i + 1`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements, `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i - 1`, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[j]` has been updated to `i`, which was previously equal to `i + 1`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The pattern in the array has been modified, with `arr[j]` now being equal to `i` instead of `i + 1`.
