Output State: **i is 0, j is equal to start_index + i, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, arr has at least i + 1 elements, and arr[j] is equal to i.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of i becomes 0, j is equal to start_index + i, start_index remains a non-negative integer within the range of the array length minus i minus 1, the array has at least i + 1 elements, and the element at index j in the array is equal to i.
