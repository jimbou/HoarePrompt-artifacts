Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the value of m // a + m // b + 2 for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point the input is exhausted. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the calculated values for each test case.**
