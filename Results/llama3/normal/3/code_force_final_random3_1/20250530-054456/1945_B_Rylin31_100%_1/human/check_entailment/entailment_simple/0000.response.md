Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program takes as input the frequency of launching for the first installation (a), the second installation (b), and the time the firework is visible in the sky (m).

The program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), and then adding 2 to the result. This is because each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes, and the installations launch fireworks every a and b minutes, respectively.

The program iterates over the input sets of a, b, and m, and for each set, it calculates and prints the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the solution to the problem. The use of integer division (//) ensures that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for counting the number of fireworks.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
