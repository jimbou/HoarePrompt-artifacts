Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18, stdin contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), and the value of m // a + m // b + 2 is being printed, `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the third set of three space-separated integers from the input, and this is printed: m // a + m // b + 2 (where a, b, and m are the third set of three space-separated integers from the input)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the third set of three space-separated integers from the input. The stdin now contains `t-4` sets of three space-separated integers. The value of `m // a + m // b + 2` is being printed, where `a`, `b`, and `m` are the third set of three space-separated integers from the input.
