The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
