Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the first set of three space-separated integers from the input, which are guaranteed to be within the range 1 to 10^18. The stdin now contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers, as one set has been consumed by the input operation.
