Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), and the value of m // a + m // b + 2 is being printed, `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the first set of three space-separated integers from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, and `i` is still 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are now the first set of three space-separated integers from the input, which are integers between 1 and 10^18. The stdin now contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). The value of m // a + m // b + 2 is being printed.
