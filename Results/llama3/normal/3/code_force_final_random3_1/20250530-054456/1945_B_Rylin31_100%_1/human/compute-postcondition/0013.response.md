Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18, stdin is empty, and the value of m // a + m // b + 2 is being printed, `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the last set of three space-separated integers from the input, and this is printed: m // a + m // b + 2 (where a, b, and m are the last set of three space-separated integers from the input), and the value of m // a + m // b + 2 is printed for all sets of three space-separated integers from the input.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `t`, and the input stream will be empty. The loop will have processed all the sets of three space-separated integers from the input, and the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` will have been printed for each set. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the values of the last set of three space-separated integers from the input.
