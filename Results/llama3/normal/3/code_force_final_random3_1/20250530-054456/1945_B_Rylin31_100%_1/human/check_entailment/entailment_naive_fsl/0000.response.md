Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when a = 1, b = 1, and m = 1, the program prints 4, but the correct answer is 2. This is because the program adds 2 to the result, which is incorrect when a and b are both 1.

The correct program should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 1)
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by adding 1 to the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation, instead of adding 2.
