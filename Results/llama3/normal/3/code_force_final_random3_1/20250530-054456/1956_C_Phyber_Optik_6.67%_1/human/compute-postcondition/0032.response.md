To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, and `r` is `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + r + 1`. Since `j` is `n + 1`, we need to increment `j` by 1 to make it `n + 2`. Additionally, `n` and `r` remain the same.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1 [j] " (where [j] is the current value of `j` which is `n + 2`) and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, then 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed.**
