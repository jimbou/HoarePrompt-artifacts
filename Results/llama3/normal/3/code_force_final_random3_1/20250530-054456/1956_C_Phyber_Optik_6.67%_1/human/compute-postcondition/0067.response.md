Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + r + 1`, If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `2 * n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 5 * n` or `6 * n`, and `r` is either 1 or 0.**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is incremented by `i * n`, where `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 3. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then the initial value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. After the increment, `sum` becomes `2 * n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n`. Otherwise, the initial value of `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `3 * n`, and `r` is either 1 or 0. After the increment, `sum` becomes either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 5 * n` or `6 * n`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
