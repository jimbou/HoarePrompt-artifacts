Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n` + 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `r` is `n`, `sum` is `n` * (`n` + 1) * (`n` + 2) // 6, stdin contains -1 inputs. `j` is `n` + `r` + 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `j` has reached its final value of `n` + `r` + 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
