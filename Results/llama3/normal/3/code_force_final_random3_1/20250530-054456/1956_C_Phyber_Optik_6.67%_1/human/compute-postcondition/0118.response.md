Output State: **n is at least 3, i is 3, t is at least 3, _ is 2, j is 2 * n + 1, r is 3, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 greater than its original value, stdin contains -1 inputs**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains at least 3, `i` remains 3, `t` remains at least 3, and `_` remains 2. The value of `j` is still 2 * `n` + 1. The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The value of `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is a positive value since `n` is at least 3. The number of inputs in stdin remains -1.
