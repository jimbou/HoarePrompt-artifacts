Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `n` is an integer that must be at least 2.

The code `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by `i * n`.

If `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, then the new value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n`.

If `sum` is `i * n`, then the new value of `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n = 3 * n`.

Since `i` is 2, the value of `sum` is now either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `3 * n`.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `3 * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + r + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs.**
