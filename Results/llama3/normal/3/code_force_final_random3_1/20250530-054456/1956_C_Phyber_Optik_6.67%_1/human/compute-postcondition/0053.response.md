The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6, r is n, i is n + 1, j is n + r + 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**
