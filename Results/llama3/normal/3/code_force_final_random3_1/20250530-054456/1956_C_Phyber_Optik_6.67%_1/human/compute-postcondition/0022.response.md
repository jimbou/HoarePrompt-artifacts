Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `1` is a literal integer value that will be printed as is.
* `j` is a variable with a current value of 1, which is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is at least 1, `j` will always be a positive integer.

Therefore, the print statement will output the literal integer 1, followed by the current value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1 1**
