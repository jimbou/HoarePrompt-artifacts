Based on the initial state, the print statement `print(*range(1, n + 1))` will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, the output will be a sequence of integers starting from 1 and ending at the value of `n`.

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
