Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 1, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 1, t is at least 3, _ is 2, j is 2 * n + 1, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 1. Then, it increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` positive integers. The value of `n` is at least 1, so this sum is also at least 1. The value of `i` is 1, and the value of `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the current value of `i` times `n`, so the new value of `sum` is greater than `i * n`. No other variables are affected.
