Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `sum` is increased by 3 * `n`, stdin contains -1 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding the product of `i` and `n`, which is 3 * `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains -1 inputs, indicating that no input has been consumed.
