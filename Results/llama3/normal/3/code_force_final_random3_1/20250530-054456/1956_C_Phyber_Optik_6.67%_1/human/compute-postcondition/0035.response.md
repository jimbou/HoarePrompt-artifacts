The code prints the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) as a sequence of values separated by spaces. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, the output will be a sequence of integers starting from 1 and ending at the current value of `n`.

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the current value of n)**
