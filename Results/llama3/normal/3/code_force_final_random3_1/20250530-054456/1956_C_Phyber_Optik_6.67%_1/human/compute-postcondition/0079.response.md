The code prints the number 2, and the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, where `j` is larger than `n` and `n` is an integer that must be at least 2. Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `j % n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number 2 and the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.
Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder of j divided by n)**
