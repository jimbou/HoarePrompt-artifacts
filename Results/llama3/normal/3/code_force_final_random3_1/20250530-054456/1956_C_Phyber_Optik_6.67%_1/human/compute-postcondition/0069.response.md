Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2 * n + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the sum of the first `n` positive integers is calculated and stored in the variable `sum`, and the variable `r` is set to `n`. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it checks if the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than the product of the current iteration `i` and `n`. If it is, the sum is updated by adding the sum of the first `n` positive integers, and `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the sum is updated by adding the product of the current iteration `i` and `n`. After the loop finishes, `i` is set to `n + 1`, and `j` is set to `2 * n + 1`. The values of `t`, `_`, and stdin remain unchanged.
