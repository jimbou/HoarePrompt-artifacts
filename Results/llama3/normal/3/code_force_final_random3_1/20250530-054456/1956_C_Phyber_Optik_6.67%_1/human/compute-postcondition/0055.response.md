To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, we need to adjust it to be within the range of the loop, which is from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, we can adjust `i` to be 1, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs**
