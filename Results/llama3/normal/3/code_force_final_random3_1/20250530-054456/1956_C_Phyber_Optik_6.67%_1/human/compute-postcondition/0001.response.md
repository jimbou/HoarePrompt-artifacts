The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1 and `_` is now 0 (since it's the first iteration).

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
