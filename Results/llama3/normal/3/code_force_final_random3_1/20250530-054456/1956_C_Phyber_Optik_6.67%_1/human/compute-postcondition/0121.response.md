Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n` + 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, stdin contains -1 inputs. `r` is `n` and `sum` is `n` * (`n` + 1) * (`n` + 2) // 6.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n` + 1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `r` has reached the value of `n`, and the variable `sum` has accumulated the sum of the first `n` positive integers multiplied by `n`, which is given by the formula `n` * (`n` + 1) * (`n` + 2) // 6. The other variables remain unchanged.
