Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, `i` is 1, and (`n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`).**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still at least 1, `_` remains 0, `n` is still at least 2, `sum` has been updated to the product of `i` and `n`, `r` is still 0, there are still no inputs in stdin, `i` is still 1, and the condition that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n` still holds.
