Output State: **`*t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`, and `r` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `*t` remains at least 1, and `_` remains 0, as they are not affected by the code. The value of `n` remains greater than 2, and `i` remains 3, as they are also not modified by the code. The value of `sum` is updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` being greater than `i * n`. If this condition is true, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`. The value of `r` is updated to 3, which is the value of `i`.
