The code prints the number 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and the string ' ' (a space). Here, `j` is larger than `n`, so the remainder of `j` divided by `n` will be the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. The `end=' '` argument in the print function means that a space will be printed after the values.

Output: **2, the remainder of j divided by n, (a space)**
