Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + r + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `3 * n`, and `r` is either 1 or 0.***
