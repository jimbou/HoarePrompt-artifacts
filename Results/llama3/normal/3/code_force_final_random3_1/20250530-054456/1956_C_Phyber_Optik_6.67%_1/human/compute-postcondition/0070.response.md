The code prints the value of `sum` which is the sum of the first `n` positive integers cubed, and the value of `n + r` which is the sum of `n` and `r`. 

Since `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` and `r` is `n`, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the first `n` positive integers cubed, and the sum of `n` and `n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6, 2n (where n is an integer that must be at least 1)**
