To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. `t` is at least 1: This information isn't directly relevant to the print statement but indicates a condition on `t`.
2. `_` is 0: This variable isn't used in the print statement.
3. `n` is an integer that must be at least 1: This is crucial because it affects the value of `j` and the calculation `j % n`.
4. `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`: This variable isn't used in the print statement.
5. `r` is `n`: This variable isn't used in the print statement.
6. `i` is `n + 1`: This variable isn't used in the print statement.
7. `j` is `n + 3`: This is directly used in the print statement.
8. `stdin` contains 0 inputs: This information isn't relevant to the print statement.

Given the print statement `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`, let's analyze what will be printed:

- `2` is a literal integer and will be printed as is.
- `j % n` is the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Since `j` is `n + 3`, `j % n` will be `3` because `n + 3` divided by `n` leaves a remainder of `3`.
- `end=' '` means that after printing the values, a space will be printed instead of a newline.

Therefore, the output will be the number 2, followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n` (which is 3), and then a space.

Output: **2 3**
