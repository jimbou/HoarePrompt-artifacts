Output: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 3`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` which is `(n + 3) % n` which is 3, with a space at the end**
