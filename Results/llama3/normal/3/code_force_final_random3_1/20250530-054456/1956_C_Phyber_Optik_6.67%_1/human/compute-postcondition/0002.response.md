Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, sum is 0, r is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, leaving stdin empty. It then initializes two new variables, `sum` and `r`, to 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
