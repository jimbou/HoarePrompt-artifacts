Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n` + 2, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `r` is `n`, `sum` is `n` * (`n` + 1) * (`n` + 2) // 6, `j` is `2n + 1`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then 1 and `j` (which is equal to `2n + 1`) are printed, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `j` is greater than `n`, then 2, the remainder of `2n + 1` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed.***
