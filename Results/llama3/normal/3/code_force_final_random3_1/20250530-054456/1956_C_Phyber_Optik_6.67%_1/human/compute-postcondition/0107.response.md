To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. 

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `j` is 2 * n + 1, stdin contains -1 inputs**
