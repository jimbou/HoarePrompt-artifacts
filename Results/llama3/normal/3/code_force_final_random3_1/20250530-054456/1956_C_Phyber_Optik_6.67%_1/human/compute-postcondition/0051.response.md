Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 3`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` are being printed. Otherwise, a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces is printed.***
