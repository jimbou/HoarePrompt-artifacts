Based on the precondition, the value of `j` is the next value in the range `range(1, 2n + 1)`. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, the range `range(1, 2n + 1)` will always have at least 3 values: 1, 2, and 3.

The print statement `print(1, j, end=' ')` will print the value 1, followed by the value of `j`, and then a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Since `j` is the next value in the range `range(1, 2n + 1)`, and `n` is at least 2, the value of `j` will always be greater than 1. Therefore, the condition `if j is less than or equal to n` will always be false, and the code will print 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

However, the print statement `print(1, j, end=' ')` only prints the value 1 and the value of `j`, without printing the remainder of `j` divided by `n` or the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be the value 1, followed by the value of `j`, which is the next value in the range `range(1, 2n + 1)`, and then a space.

Output: **1, [j] (where j is the next value in the range range(1, 2n + 1))**
