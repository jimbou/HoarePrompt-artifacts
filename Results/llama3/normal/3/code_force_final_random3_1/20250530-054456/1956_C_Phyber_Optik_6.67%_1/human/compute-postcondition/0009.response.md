The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`*t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n` and `r` is 0.**
