Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

1. `sum` is defined as `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, which is a formula for calculating the sum of the first `n` positive integers. Since `n` is an integer, `sum` will be an integer value.
2. `n + r` is simply the sum of `n` and `r`, where `r` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `n + r` is equivalent to `2n`.

Now, let's consider the print statement: `print(sum, n + r)`

The print statement will output two values:

1. The value of `sum`, which is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`.
2. The value of `n + r`, which is equivalent to `2n`.

Since `n` is an integer, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum` and `n + r` without knowing the value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **sum (where sum is the sum of the first n positive integers), 2n (where n is the value of n)**
