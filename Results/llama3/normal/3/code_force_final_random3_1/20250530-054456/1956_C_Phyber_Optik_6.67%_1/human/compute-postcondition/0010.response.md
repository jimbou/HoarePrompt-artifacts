Output State: **`*t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `r` is 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `i`. The value of `sum` has been updated based on the initial condition. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is the sum of `i * n` and `n * (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
