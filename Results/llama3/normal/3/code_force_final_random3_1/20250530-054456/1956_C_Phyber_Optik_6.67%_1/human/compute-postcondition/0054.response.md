The code snippet provided consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. However, since stdin contains 0 inputs, this line will not assign any value to `n`. The second line assigns 0 to both `sum` and `r`.

Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is 0, r is 0, i is n + 1, j is n + r + 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**
