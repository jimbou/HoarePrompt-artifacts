Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `sum` is increased by 2 * `n`, stdin contains -1 inputs**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `_`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `sum` is increased by 2 * `n`, which means it is now equal to its previous value plus 2 times the value of `n`. The stdin still contains -1 inputs, indicating that there is no change in the input.
