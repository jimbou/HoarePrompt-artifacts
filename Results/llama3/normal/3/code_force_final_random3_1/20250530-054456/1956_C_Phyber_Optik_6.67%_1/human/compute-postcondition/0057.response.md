Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 1, i is 1, j is n + 1, stdin contains 0 inputs. The current value of `n` times `n + 1` divided by 2 is greater than the current value of `i` times `n`.**

The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 1. The second line increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`, making `sum` equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`. No other variables are affected.
