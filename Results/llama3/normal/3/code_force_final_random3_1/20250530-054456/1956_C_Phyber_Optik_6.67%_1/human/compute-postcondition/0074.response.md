Based on the precondition, the variables `j` is 1 and is less than or equal to `n`. The variable `_` is 1.

The `print` statement is printing three values: `1`, `j`, and an empty string with a space character (`end=' '`). 

The value of `1` is explicitly given as 1. The value of `j` is 1.

Output: **1 1**
