This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the first n positive integers and the number of rows (r) required to satisfy a certain condition. It then prints the calculated sum and the value of r plus n. Additionally, it prints a sequence of numbers for each row, where the first row contains the numbers 1 to n, and subsequent rows contain the numbers 1 to n, but with an offset of 1 for each row. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
