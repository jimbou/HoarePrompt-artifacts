Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 3, i is 3, j is n + r + 1, sum is either n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2, n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2, or 3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2, and r is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains the same. The value of `n` is still an integer that must be at least 3. The value of `i` is still 3. The value of `j` is updated to `n + r + 1`, where `r` is now 3. The value of `sum` is updated based on the previous value of `sum` and the new value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The value of `r` is updated to 3.
