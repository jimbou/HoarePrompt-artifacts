To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(1, n + r + 1):`

The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

From the given state, we know that `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, and `r` is equal to `n`. We also know that `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, but since it's the loop variable, we can infer that its value is the next value in the range.

To determine the next value of `j`, we need to consider the range `range(1, n + r + 1)`. Since `r` is equal to `n`, the range can be simplified to `range(1, 2n + 1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have been the last value in the range that was executed. To determine the next value of `j`, we need to increment it by 1.

So, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is the next value in the range `range(1, 2n + 1)`, stdin contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` and `2 * n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then 1, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, then 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed.**
