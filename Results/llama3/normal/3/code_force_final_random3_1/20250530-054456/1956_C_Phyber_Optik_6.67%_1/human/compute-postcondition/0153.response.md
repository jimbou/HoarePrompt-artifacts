The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is at least 2.

Since `n` is at least 2, the sequence will start from 1 and end at a value that is at least 2. The exact value of `n` is not provided, so we can't determine the exact end value of the sequence.

However, we can describe the output as a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Output: **1, 2, ..., n (where n is at least 2)**
