Based on the precondition, the value of `j` is the next value in the range `range(1, 2n + 1)`. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, the range `range(1, 2n + 1)` will always have at least 3 values: 1, 2, and 3.

The print statement `print(2, j % n, end=' ')` will print the value 2, followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and then a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Since `j` is the next value in the range `range(1, 2n + 1)`, and `n` is at least 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` will always be either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the print statement will print either "2 0 " or "2 1 ", depending on the value of `j`.

Output: **2 [0 or 1]**
