Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program takes the number of test cases and the size of the matrix as input.

The program calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by filling the matrix with numbers from 1 to n. It does this by iterating over the rows of the matrix and calculating the sum of the numbers that can be placed in each row. The program also keeps track of the number of operations required to achieve this sum.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve it. It also prints the sequence of operations required to achieve the maximum sum. The operations are either of type 1 (filling a row with numbers) or type 2 (filling a column with numbers).

The program uses a loop to print the sequence of operations. For each operation, it prints the type of operation, the row or column number, and the sequence of numbers to be placed in that row or column.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
