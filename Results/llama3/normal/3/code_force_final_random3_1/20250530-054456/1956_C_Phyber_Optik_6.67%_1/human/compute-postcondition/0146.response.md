To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + r + 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is at least 2
* `i` is `n` + 2
* `t` is at least 3
* `_` is 2
* `r` is `n`
* `sum` is `n` * (`n` + 1) * (`n` + 2) // 6
* `stdin` contains -1 inputs

We need to adjust the state of `j` to determine if the loop can execute again. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

Since `r` is `n`, the loop condition becomes `j` < `n + n + 1` = `2n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that it has reached the value of `n + r` (since `i` is `n` + 2, and `i` is not directly related to the loop).

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state of `j` is `n + r + 1`.

Since `r` is `n`, the new state of `j` is `n + n + 1` = `2n + 1`.

The other variables in the loop head are `n` and `r`, but their values do not change.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n` + 2, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `r` is `n`, `sum` is `n` * (`n` + 1) * (`n` + 2) // 6, `j` is `2n + 1`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs**
