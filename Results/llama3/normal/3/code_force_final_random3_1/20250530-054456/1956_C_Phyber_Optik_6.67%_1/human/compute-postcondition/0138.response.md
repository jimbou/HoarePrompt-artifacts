Output: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n` + 2, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `r` is `n`, `sum` is `n` * (`n` + 1) * (`n` + 2) // 6, stdin contains -1 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then 1, `j`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, then 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed, and this is printed: 1 and `j`**
