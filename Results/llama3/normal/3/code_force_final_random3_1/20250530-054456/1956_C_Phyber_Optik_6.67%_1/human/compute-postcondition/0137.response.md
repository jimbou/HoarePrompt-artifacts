Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `1` is a literal value that will be printed as is.
* `j` is a variable that depends on its value relative to `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it will be printed as is. If `j` is larger than `n`, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` will be printed.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` relative to `n`, we can't determine the exact output. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the condition:

Output: **1, j (if j is less than or equal to n), or 1, remainder of j divided by n (if j is larger than n)**
