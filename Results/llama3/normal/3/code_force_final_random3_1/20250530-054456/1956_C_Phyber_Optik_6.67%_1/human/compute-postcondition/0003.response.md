The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, sum is 0, r is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 1. 
State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is at least 2, sum is 0, r is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is 1**
