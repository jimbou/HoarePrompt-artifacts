Based on the initial state, the print statement `print(*range(1, n + 1))` will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is at least 1, the sequence will start with 1 and end with `n`. The `*` operator in the print statement is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments to the print function, which will print each number in the sequence separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n, which is at least 1)**
