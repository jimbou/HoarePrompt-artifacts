The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + r + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n` and `r` is 0.**
