Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6, r is n, i is n + 1, j is n + r + 1, stdin contains 0 inputs. If j is less than or equal to n, then "1 [j] " (where [j] is the current value of j which is n + r + 1) and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are printed. If j is larger than n, then 2, the remainder of j divided by n, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) are printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `t` is 0, the loop variable `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`, the input `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, the sum of the first `n` positive integers is calculated and stored in `sum`, the remainder `r` is equal to `n`, the loop variable `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and the loop variable `j` is equal to `n + r + 1`. The standard input `stdin` contains 0 inputs. The output depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then the string "1 [j] " (where [j] is the current value of `j` which is `n + r + 1`) and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, then the string "2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed.
