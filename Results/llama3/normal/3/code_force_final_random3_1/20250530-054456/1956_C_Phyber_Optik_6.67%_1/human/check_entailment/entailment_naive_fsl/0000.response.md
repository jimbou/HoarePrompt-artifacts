Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations. The program assumes that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers, but this is not always the case.

For example, consider a 3x3 matrix. The program would calculate the maximum sum as 15 (3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6, and 6 * 3 = 18, but since 18 is greater than 15, it would use 15 as the maximum sum). However, this is incorrect. The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in a way that maximizes the sum.

The correct approach would be to fill the matrix with the numbers 1 to n in a way that maximizes the sum. This can be achieved by using a greedy approach, where we fill the matrix with the largest possible numbers first.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:
3

Output:
21 4
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 2 3 1
1 3 3 1 2
2 1 1 2 3
2 2 2 3 1

The maximum sum is 21, but the program outputs 18. The correct output should be:

21 3
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 2 3 1
2 1 1 2 3

This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
