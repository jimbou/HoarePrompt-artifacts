The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2 * n + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` and `2 * n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then 1, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 1, `j` is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, then 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 1, and the value of `j` is printed, and a space is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed.**
