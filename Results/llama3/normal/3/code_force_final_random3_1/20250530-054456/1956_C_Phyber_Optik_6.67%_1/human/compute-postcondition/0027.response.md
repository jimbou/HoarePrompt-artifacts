The `print` statement will print the values of three expressions: `2`, `j % n`, and an empty string due to the `end=' '` argument.

Here's a breakdown of each expression:

*   `2`: This is a literal integer value, so it will be printed as is.
*   `j % n`: This expression calculates the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Since `j` is larger than `n`, the remainder will be a value between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive). Without knowing the exact values of `j` and `n`, we can't determine the precise remainder. However, we can describe it as the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.
*   `end=' '`: This argument specifies that a space character should be printed after the previous expressions, rather than the default newline character.

Considering the initial state and the expressions being printed, the output will be:

Output: **2, the remainder of j divided by n, (space)**
