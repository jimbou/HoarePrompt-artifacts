To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n + r` is at least 1. Since `n` is an integer and `r` is `n`, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `j` is 1**
