To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is at least 1
* `i` is 1
* `t` is at least 3
* `_` is 2
* `j` is 2 * `n` + 1
* stdin contains -1 inputs

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, since the loop will iterate to the next value of `i`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

* `n` is at least 1 (no change)
* `i` is 2 (incremented by 1)
* `t` is at least 3 (no change)
* `_` is 2 (no change)
* `j` is 2 * `n` + 1 (no change, since `n` is not changed)
* stdin contains -1 inputs (no change)

Note that the values of `sum` and `r` are not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to consider them when determining the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, stdin contains -1 inputs**
