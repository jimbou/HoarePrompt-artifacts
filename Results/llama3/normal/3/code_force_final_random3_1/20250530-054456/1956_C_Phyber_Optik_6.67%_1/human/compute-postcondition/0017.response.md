Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, sum is n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6, r is n, i is n + 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains at least 1, the variable `_` remains 0, and the variable `n` remains an integer. The variable `sum` has accumulated the sum of the first `n` positive integers, which is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`. The variable `r` has been updated to `n`, indicating that the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true for all iterations. The variable `i` has reached `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of the `stdin` variable remains unchanged, containing 0 inputs.
