Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to `i * n`, which is the product of the current values of `i` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `n`, `r`, `i`, `j`, and the relationship between `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n` are still valid.
