Output State: **`*t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` or `i * n + i * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding `i * n` to its previous value. The previous value of `sum` was either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. Since `i` is 2, the new value of `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `2 * n + 2 * n`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
