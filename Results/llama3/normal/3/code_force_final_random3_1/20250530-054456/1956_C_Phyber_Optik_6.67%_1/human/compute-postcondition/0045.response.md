The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Output: **A sequence of numbers from 1 to n (where n is an integer that must be at least 1)**
