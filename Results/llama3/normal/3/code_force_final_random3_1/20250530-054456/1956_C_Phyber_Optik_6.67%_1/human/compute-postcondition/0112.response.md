Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, stdin contains -1 inputs. If the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is `n` * (`n` + 1) // 2 and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `n` + 0 and `r` is 0.***
