To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + r + 1`. Since `r` is `n`, we can rewrite this condition as `j` must be less than `2n + 1`.

To satisfy this condition, we can increment `j` by 1, making it `n + 3`.

The values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 3`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
