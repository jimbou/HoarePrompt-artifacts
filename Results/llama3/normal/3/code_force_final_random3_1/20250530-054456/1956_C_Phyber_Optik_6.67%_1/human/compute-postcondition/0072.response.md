To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `j` is the loop variable, and its initial value is 1.
2. `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, which is already given in the initial state.
3. `r` is `n`, which means `r` is also at least 1.

For the loop to execute, the condition `1 <= n + r` must be true. Since `n` and `r` are both at least 1, this condition is already satisfied.

However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state of `n` and `r` to be at least 2, so that the range `range(1, n + r + 1)` has at least one element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` and `2 * n`**

Note that we only adjusted the states of `n` and `r`, which are the objects in the loop head, to ensure the loop executes at least once.
