The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + r + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `3 * n`, and `r` is either 1 or 0.**
