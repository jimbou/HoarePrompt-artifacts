Output: ** `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `j` is 1. The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`, and this is printed: "1 [j] " (where [j] is the current value of `j` which is 1), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is being printed**
