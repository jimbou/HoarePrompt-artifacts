Output State: **`*t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n + i * n` or `i * n + i * n + i * n`, and `r` is either 1 or 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding `i * n` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `sum` and `r` are still dependent on the comparison between `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n`.
