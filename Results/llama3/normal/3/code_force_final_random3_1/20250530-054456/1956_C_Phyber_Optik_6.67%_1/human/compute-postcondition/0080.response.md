Output: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is larger than `n`, stdin contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` and `2 * n`, and this is printed: 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`**
