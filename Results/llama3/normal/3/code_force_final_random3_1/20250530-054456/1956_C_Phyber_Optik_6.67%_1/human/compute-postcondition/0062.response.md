Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 2, i is 2, j is n + r + 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `sum`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 2. The second line increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` positive integers. Since `sum` was initially either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` when `n` is at least 2, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
