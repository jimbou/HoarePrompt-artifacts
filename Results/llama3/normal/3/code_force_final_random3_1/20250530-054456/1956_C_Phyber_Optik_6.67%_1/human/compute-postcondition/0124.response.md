To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop will execute if `n + r` is at least 1. Since `n` is at least 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, `n + r` is at least 2. Therefore, the loop will execute.

Before the loop starts, `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, which is greater than `n + r`. To ensure the loop executes, `j` should be equal to 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n` + 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `j` is 1, `r` is `n`, `sum` is `n` * (`n` + 1) * (`n` + 2) // 6, stdin contains -1 inputs**
