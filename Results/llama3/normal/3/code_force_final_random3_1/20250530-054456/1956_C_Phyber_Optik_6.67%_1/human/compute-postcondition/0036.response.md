Output: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: "1 [n + 2] " (where [n + 2] is the current value of `j` which is `n + 2`), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, where `n` is the current value of `n`**
