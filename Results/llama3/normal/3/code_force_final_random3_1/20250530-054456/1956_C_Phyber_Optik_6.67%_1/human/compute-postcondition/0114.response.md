Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 2, t is at least 3, _ is 2, j is 2 * n + 1, r is 2, sum is increased by n * (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains -1 inputs**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `_`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The variable `sum` is incremented by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is a positive integer since `n` is at least 1. The stdin remains unchanged as it still contains -1 inputs.
