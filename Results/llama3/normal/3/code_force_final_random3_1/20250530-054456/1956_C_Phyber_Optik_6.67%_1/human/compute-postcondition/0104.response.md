Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2 * n + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` and `2 * n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then 1, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 1, `j` is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, then 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 1, and the value of `j` is printed, and a space is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed output. The loop iterates over the range `range(1, n + r + 1)`, which is equivalent to `range(1, 2n + 1)`. For each iteration, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints 1, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `j` is larger than `n`, it prints 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The loop also prints the value of `j` and a space after each iteration. The final output state includes the printed output, which consists of the initial print statement, followed by the output of the loop iterations.
