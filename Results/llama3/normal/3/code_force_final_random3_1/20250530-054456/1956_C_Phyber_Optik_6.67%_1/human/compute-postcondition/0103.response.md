Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`, `r` is `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is the next value in the range `range(1, 2n + 1)`, stdin contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` and `2 * n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then 1, 1, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 1, `j` is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, then 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, and 1, and the value of `j` is printed, and a space is printed, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed***
