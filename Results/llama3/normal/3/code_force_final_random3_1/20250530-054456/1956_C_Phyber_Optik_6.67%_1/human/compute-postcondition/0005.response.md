Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is at least 2, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The value of `n` is still at least 2, as it is not changed by the code. The value of `sum` is updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` positive integers. The value of `r` is set to 1, which is the initial value of `i`. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing 0 inputs. The value of `i` remains 1, as it is not modified by the code.
