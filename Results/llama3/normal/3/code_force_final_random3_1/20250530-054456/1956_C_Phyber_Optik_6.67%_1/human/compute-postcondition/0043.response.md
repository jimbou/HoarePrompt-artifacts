Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `t` is at least 1 (but its exact value is not specified)
* `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement)
* `n` is an integer that must be at least 1
* `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` (this variable is not used in the print statement)
* `r` is `n` (this variable is not used in the print statement)
* `i` is `n + 1` (this variable is not used in the print statement)
* `j` is `n + 3`
* `stdin` contains 0 inputs (this is not relevant to the print statement)

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(1, j, end=' ')`

The print statement will print two values:

1. The literal integer `1`
2. The value of `j`, which is `n + 3`

Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `j` will be at least 4.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1, [j] (where j is at least 4)**

Note that we can't provide an exact numerical value for `j` since `n` is not specified, but we can describe its minimum value.
