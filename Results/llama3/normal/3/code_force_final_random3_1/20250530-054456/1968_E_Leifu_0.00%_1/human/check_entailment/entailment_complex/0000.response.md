Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints a series of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program first prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) for all values of n. If n is 3, it prints the point (2, 3). For n greater than 3, it prints the points (2, 4) and then the points (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n.

The program's approach is based on the observation that the Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is equal to |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. By choosing points that have the maximum possible Manhattan distance, the program maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples, and it correctly handles the special case where n is 3.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
