The code prints a string containing the value of `j` followed by a space and then the value of `j` again.

Since the value of `j` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string in the format "j j".

Output: **j j (where j is the value of j)**
