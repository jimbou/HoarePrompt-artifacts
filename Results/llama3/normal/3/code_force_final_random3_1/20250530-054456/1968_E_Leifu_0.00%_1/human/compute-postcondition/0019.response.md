To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `j` is 5. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 6.

The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^3 except 3, and `j` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `t`, `i`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2', and this is printed: '2 4', and this is printed: '4 4', and this is printed: '5 5'**
