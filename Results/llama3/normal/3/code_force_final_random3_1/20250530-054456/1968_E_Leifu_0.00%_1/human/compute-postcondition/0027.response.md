Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin contains `t-3` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `n` is already an integer between 2 and 10^3, the value of `n` is updated to the new input value. The other variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code. The standard input now contains `t-3` integers, since one integer has been read and assigned to `n`. The printed output remains the same, as the code does not modify the printed output.
