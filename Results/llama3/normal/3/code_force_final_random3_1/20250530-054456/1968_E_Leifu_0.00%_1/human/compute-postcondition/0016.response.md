To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.


The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`. The objects involved are `j` and `n`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5.


The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer between 4 and 10^3 except 3.


State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^3 except 3, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2', and this is printed: '2 4', j is 5, and this is printed: '4 4'**
