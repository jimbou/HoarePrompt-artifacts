The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains `t` integers, and the first integer is assigned to `n`. The value of `t` is greater than 0, so `n` is between 2 and 10^3. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since one integer has been read from the stdin, it now contains `t-1` integers.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin contains `t-1` integers**
