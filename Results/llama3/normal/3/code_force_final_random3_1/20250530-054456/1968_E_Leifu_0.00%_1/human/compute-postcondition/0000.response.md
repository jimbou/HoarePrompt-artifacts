Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` integers `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The remaining `t` integers `n` are still in stdin, each between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).
