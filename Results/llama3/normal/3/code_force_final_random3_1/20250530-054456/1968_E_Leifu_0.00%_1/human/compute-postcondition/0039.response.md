To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4, and `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3, stdin contains `t-3` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is 5**
