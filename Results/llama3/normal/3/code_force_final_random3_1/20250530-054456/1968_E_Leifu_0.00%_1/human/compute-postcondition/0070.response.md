Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t), and each subsequent integer (n) represents the number of elements in a sequence. For each sequence, the function prints a series of numbers from 1 to n, each followed by the same number. If n is not 3, it also prints a series of numbers from 4 to n, each followed by the same number. The function consumes all input from standard input and produces the described output.**
