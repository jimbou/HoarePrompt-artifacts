Output: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin contains `t-3` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed**
