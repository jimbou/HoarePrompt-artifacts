To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 4, since the range starts from 4 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3, stdin contains `t-3` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is 4**
