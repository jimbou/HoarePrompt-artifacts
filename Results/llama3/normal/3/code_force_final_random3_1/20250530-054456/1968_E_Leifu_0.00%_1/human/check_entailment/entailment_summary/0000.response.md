Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by printing a series of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The program first prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) for all values of n. If n is 3, it prints the additional point (2, 3). For n greater than 3, it prints the additional point (2, 4) and then prints the points (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n.

However, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of n. For example, when n is 4, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 4), but the correct solution is (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4). Similarly, when n is 5, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 4), (5, 5), but the correct solution is (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (5, 5).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
