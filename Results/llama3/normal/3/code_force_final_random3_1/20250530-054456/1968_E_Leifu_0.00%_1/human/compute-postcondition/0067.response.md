Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin contains `t-4` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, j is `n`, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed, each followed by the same number.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches the value of `n`. At each iteration, the current value of `j` will be printed followed by the same number. After the loop finishes, the final value of `j` will be equal to `n`, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` will have been printed, each followed by the same number. The state of the other variables, including `t`, `i`, and the contents of stdin, will remain unchanged.
