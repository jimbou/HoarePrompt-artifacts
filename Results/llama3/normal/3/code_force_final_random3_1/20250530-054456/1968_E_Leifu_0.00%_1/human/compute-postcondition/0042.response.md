The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 6, and `n` must be greater than 6.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 6 and 10^3, stdin contains `t-3` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and '5 5' is printed**
