Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4

However, the correct output should be:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

The program is missing the point (1, 3) and incorrectly prints (2, 4) instead of (4, 3). This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when n is even and greater than 2.
