Output: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 that must be greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains `t-4` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, j is 5, and this is printed: '5 5', and '5 5' is printed**
