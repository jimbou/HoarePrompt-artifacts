The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 6, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 that must be greater than 5, stdin contains `t-4` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, j is 6, and this is printed: '5 5', and '5 5' is printed**
