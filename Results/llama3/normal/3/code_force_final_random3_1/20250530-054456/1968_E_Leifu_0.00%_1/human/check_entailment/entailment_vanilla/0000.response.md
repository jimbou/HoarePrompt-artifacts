Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program attempts to solve this problem by printing out specific coordinates for each value of n.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of n. For example, when n = 4, the program prints out the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 4). However, this arrangement does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

In fact, the program only correctly solves the problem for n = 2 and n = 3. For all other values of n, the program prints out incorrect coordinates.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
