The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 except 3, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2', and this is printed: '2 4' does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and j is now 4. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^3 except 3, stdin contains `t-1` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2', and this is printed: '2 4', j is 4**
