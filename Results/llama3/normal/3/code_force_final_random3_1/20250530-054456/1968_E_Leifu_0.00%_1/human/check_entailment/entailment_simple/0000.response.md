Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The coordinates are printed in the format "x y", where x and y are the row and column numbers of the cell, respectively.

The program uses a simple strategy to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. It starts by printing the coordinates of the cell at position (1, 1). Then, it prints the coordinates of the cell at position (1, 2). If n is equal to 3, it prints the coordinates of the cell at position (2, 3). Otherwise, it prints the coordinates of the cell at position (2, 4), and then for each j from 4 to n, it prints the coordinates of the cell at position (j, j).

This strategy is based on the observation that the Manhattan distance between two cells is maximized when the cells are located at opposite corners of the grid. By placing the cells at positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3) or (2, 4), the program ensures that the Manhattan distances between these cells are maximized.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
