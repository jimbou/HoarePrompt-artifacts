Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly solve the problem. It only handles the cases where n is 2, 3, or greater than 3, but it does not provide the correct output for all cases. For example, when n is 4, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4

However, the correct output for n = 4 is:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

The program does not correctly handle the case where n is greater than 3. It simply prints '2 4' and then prints the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n. This does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to be modified to handle all cases correctly. One possible solution is to use a loop to print the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, n), and then print the coordinates (2, 1), (3, 1), ..., (n, 1). This will maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
