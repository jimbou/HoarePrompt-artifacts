The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin contains t-4 integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If n is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If n is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and a series of numbers from 4 to n are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than or equal to 4 and j is now 4. 
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 that must be greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains `t-4` integers, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2'. If `n` is 3, then this is printed: '2 3'. If `n` is not 3, then a series of numbers from 2 to 200 are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed, each followed by the same number, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, j is 4**
