Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is an integer between 3 and n, right is an integer between 1 and n-2. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing the element at index left of arr. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing two integers: arr[right] and arr[left].**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `left` is incremented by 1, so it is now between 3 and `n`, and the value of `right` is decremented by 1, so it is now between 1 and `n-2`. The value of `new_arr` is determined based on the new values of `left` and `right`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` contains the element at index `left` of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains two integers: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.
