This function takes a list of integers and an integer n as input, sorts the list in ascending order, rearranges the sorted list in a specific order (alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements), and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged list. The function returns this sum, which represents the maximum beauty of the rearranged list.
