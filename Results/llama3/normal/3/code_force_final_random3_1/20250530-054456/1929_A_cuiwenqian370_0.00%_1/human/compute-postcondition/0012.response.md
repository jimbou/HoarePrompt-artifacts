Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is an integer between 2 and n-1, right is an integer between 0 and n-3. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing three elements: arr[right], arr[left], and arr[left]. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left] in that order.**

The code increments the value of `left` by 1 and decrements the value of `right` by 1. As a result, `left` is now an integer between 2 and `n-1`, and `right` is an integer between 0 and `n-3`. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `new_arr` depends on whether `left` equals `right` after the code executes. If they are equal, `new_arr` contains three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains four elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]`.
