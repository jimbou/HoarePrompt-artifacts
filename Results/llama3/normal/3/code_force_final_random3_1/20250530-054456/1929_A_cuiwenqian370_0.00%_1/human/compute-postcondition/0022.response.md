To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `arr` in reverse order (no change needed for the next iteration)
* `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `arr` in reverse order (no change needed for the next iteration)
* `left` is `n` (no change needed for the next iteration)
* `right` is -1 (no change needed for the next iteration)
* `n` is greater than 1 (no change needed for the next iteration)
* `i` is 1 (needs to be incremented for the next iteration)

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `arr` in reverse order, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is `n`, `right` is -1, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
