The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between the third and second elements of `arr` in reverse order, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is `n`, `right` is -1, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
