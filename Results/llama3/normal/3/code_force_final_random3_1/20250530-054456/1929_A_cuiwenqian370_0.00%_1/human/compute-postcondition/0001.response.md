To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `left <= right`.

Given the initial states:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

The loop condition `left <= right` will always be true given the initial states because `left` is initialized to 0 and `right` is initialized to `n - 1`, where `n` is at least 2. This means `right` will always be greater than or equal to `left`, satisfying the loop condition.

Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, and right is n - 1.**
