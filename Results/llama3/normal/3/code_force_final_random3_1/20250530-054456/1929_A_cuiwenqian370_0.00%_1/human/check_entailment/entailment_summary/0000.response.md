Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. The program first sorts the input array in ascending order. This is a necessary step because the maximum beauty can be achieved by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

3. The program then rearranges the sorted array in a specific order, alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This is done by maintaining two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array, and swapping the elements at these positions.

4. After rearranging the array, the program calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This sum represents the maximum beauty of the rearranged array.

5. The program returns this sum as the result.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program works as expected. It correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the input array by rearranging its elements.

Correctness: **True**
