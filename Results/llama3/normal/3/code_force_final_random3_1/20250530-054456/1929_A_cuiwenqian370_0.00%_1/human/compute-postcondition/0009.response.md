The code appends the value of `arr[left]` to the list `new_arr`. Since `left` is 1, `arr[left]` is the second element of the sorted list `arr`. The list `new_arr` initially contains two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`. After the execution of the code, `new_arr` will contain three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]` again.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `left` is 1, `right` is n-2, `new_arr` is a list containing three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`.**
