Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by first sorting the array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements from the sorted array. Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

However, this approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to simply sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. The alternating approach used in the program does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

For example, consider the input array [1, 3, 2]. The program would create the new array [3, 1, 2], which has a beauty of 2. However, the correct solution would be to sort the array as [1, 2, 3], which has a beauty of 2.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
