Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is an integer between 2 and n-1, right is an integer between 2 and n-3, new_arr is a list containing two integers: arr[right] and arr[left].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code creates a new list `new_arr` and appends two elements to it: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`. Since `arr` is a sorted list and `right` and `left` are integers between 2 and `n-1` and `n-3` respectively, the values of `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` are integers between 1 and 10^9.
