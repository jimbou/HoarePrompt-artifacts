The value of `max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. Since `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `arr` in reverse order, `new_arr[i]` is the ith element of `arr` in reverse order and `new_arr[i - 1]` is the (i-1)th element of `arr` in reverse order. The value of `i` is 1. The absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` is the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `arr` in reverse order. The value of `max_beauty` is increased by this absolute difference. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `arr` in reverse order, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is `n`, `right` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
