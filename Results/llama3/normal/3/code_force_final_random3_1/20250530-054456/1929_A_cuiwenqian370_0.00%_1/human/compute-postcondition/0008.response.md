According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 1, `right` is `n-2`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, so `right` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `right` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is 1, right is n-2, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left] in that order.**
