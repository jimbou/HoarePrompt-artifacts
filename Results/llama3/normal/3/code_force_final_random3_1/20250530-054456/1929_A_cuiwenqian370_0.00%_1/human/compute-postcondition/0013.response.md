To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `left` and `right` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `left` is less than or equal to `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, and `right` is an integer between 0 and `n-3`.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `right` to be at least equal to `left`. Since `left` is at least 2, we need to adjust `right` to be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `left` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, `right` is an integer between 2 and `n-3`**
