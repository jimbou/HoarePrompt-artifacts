Output State: **new_arr is a list containing all the elements of arr in reverse order, left is n, and right is -1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the list `new_arr` will contain all the elements of the original list `arr`, but in reverse order. The variable `left` will be equal to `n`, which is the length of the list `arr`, and the variable `right` will be equal to `-1`, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the list.
