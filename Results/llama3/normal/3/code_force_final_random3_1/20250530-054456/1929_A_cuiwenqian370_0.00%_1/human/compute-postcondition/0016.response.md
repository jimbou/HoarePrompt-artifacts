Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `left` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, `right` is an integer between 2 and `n-3`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the element at index `left` of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing two integers: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.***
