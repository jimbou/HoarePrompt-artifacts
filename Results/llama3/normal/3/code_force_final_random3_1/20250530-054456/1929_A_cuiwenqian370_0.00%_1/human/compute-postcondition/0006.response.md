Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing the first element of arr, and left and right are still equal, both being 0. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left] in that order, and left is less than right.***
