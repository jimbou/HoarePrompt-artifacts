Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i. left is less than right, left is 1, right is n-2, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left] in that order.**

The code increments `left` by 1 and decrements `right` by 1. Since `left` was initially equal to 0 and `right` was equal to 0, after the execution of the code, `left` becomes 1 and `right` becomes -1. However, since `right` is an index into the list `arr`, it is adjusted to be `n-2` to remain a valid index. The value of `n` and the elements of `arr` remain unchanged. The list `new_arr` still contains two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` in that order.
