Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is 1, right is n-2, new_arr is a list containing four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left] in that order.**

The code appends the values of `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` to the `new_arr` list. Since `new_arr` initially contains two elements (`arr[right]` and `arr[left]`), the code adds two more elements to the list, resulting in a total of four elements. The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
