Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, and `left` and `right` are still equal, both being 0.**

In this output state, the value of `new_arr` has been updated to include the first element of `arr`, which is `arr[left]`. Since `left` is 0, `new_arr` now contains the smallest element of `arr`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
