Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and the program sorts the array in ascending order and then rearranges it to maximize this sum.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty is achieved when the largest element is placed next to the smallest element, the second largest element is placed next to the second smallest element, and so on. This is because the difference between two elements is maximized when the elements are as far apart as possible.

The program implements this logic by sorting the array and then creating a new array where the elements are alternately taken from the beginning and end of the sorted array. This ensures that the largest element is placed next to the smallest element, the second largest element is placed next to the second smallest element, and so on.

The program then calculates the beauty of the rearranged array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is correct because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and the absolute value is used to ensure that the differences are always positive.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
