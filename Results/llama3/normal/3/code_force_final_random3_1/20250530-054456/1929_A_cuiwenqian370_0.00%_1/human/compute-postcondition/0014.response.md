Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `left` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, `right` is an integer between 2 and `n-3`, `new_arr` is a list containing the element at index `left` of `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remains the same as in the initial state. However, a new list `new_arr` is created and it contains the element at index `left` of the sorted list `arr`.
