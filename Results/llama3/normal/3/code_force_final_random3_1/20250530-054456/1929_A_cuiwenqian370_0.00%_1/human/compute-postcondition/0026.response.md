Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `arr` in reverse order, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is `n`, `right` is -1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `max_beauty` has been incremented by the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of the input array `arr` in reverse order. The `new_arr` remains unchanged as a list containing all elements of `arr` in reverse order. The `left` and `right` variables remain unchanged at `n` and `-1`, respectively. The loop variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
