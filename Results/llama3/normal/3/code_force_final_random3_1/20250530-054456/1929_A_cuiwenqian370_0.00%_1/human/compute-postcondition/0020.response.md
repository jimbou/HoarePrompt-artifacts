The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `max_beauty` is 0, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is `n`, and `right` is -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`max_beauty` is 0, `new_arr` is a list containing all the elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is `n`, `right` is -1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
