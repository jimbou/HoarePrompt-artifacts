Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is 1, right is n-2. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing three elements: arr[right], arr[left], and arr[left]. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left] in that order.***
