Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, and right is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
while left <= right:
    if left == right:
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    else:
        new_arr.append(arr[right])
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    left += 1
    right -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i. left is less than right, left is 1, right is n-2, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left] in that order.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is an integer between 2 and n-1, right is an integer between 0 and n-3. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing three elements: arr[right], arr[left], and arr[left]. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left] in that order.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is an integer between 3 and n, right is an integer between 1 and n-2. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing the element at index left of arr. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing two integers: arr[right] and arr[left].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
