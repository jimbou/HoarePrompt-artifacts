Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, and right is n - 1.**

The code snippet sorts the list `arr` in ascending order, and initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the list, respectively. It also creates an empty list `new_arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
