Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n integers representing the array a. n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The permutation p and array a are lists of positive integers.**
