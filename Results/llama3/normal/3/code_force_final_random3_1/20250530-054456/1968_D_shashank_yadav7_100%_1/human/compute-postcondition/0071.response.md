The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 1, n is greater than 1, b is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[b] - 1] times k plus a[b], sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[s] - 1] times k plus a[s], and k is either 0 or -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
