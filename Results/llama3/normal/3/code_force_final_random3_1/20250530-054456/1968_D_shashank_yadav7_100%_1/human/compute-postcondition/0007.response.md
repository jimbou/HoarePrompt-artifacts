Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is an integer minus 1, `s` is an integer minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` times `k+1`, `sm` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` times `k+1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is an integer minus 1.***
