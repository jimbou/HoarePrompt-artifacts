Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n, i is 0, n must be greater than 0, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1 minus 1, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1 minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of bm and a[b] times k plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of sm and a[s] times k plus sp, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either 'Bodya' is printed if bm is greater than sm, or 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, or 'Draw' is printed if bm is equal to sm.**
