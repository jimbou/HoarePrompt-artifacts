Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1 minus 1 minus 1, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1 minus 1 minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` plus `a[s]` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` plus `a[b]` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of `bm` and `a[b]` times `(k-1)` plus `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s]` times `(k-1)` plus `sp`, `k` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables keep their previous values, and we have one less test case in the stdin.
