Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 1, n is greater than 1, b is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[b] - 1] times (k-1) plus a[b], sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[s] - 1] times (k-1) plus a[s], and k is either -1 or -2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the value of k has been decremented by 1, so it is now either -1 or -2. The values of bm and sm have also been updated to reflect the new value of k. The other variables remain unchanged.
