Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, b is an integer minus 1, s is an integer minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b, bm is an integer equal to the value of a at index b times k, sm is an integer equal to the value of a at index s times k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than 0, b is an integer minus 1, s is an integer minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, k is an integer minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is greater than 1, b is an integer, s is an integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp, k is an integer minus 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, n is greater than 2, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp, k is an integer minus 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
