Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game between Bodya and Sasha based on the given permutation and array. The program updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation, calculates their scores, and determines the winner of each game.

The program uses a loop to simulate the game for each test case. Inside the loop, it reads the input for each test case, initializes the positions and scores of Bodya and Sasha, and then simulates the game. The simulation involves updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation, calculating their scores, and determining the maximum possible score for each player.

The program uses the variables `bm` and `sm` to keep track of the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively. It updates these variables at each step of the simulation, taking into account the current position and score of each player.

Finally, the program prints the winner of each game based on the final scores of Bodya and Sasha. If Bodya's score is greater than Sasha's score, it prints "Bodya". If Sasha's score is greater than Bodya's score, it prints "Sasha". If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic of the game and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
