Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is equal to n, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s] plus ... plus a[s] n times, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b] plus ... plus a[b] n times, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] times (k-1) plus a[p[b] - 1] plus a[p[b] - 1] times k, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] times (k-1) plus a[p[s] - 1] plus a[p[s] - 1] times k, and k is equal to -n. Additionally, if bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. If bm is greater than or equal to sm, 'Draw' is printed.***
