Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is an integer, `s` is an integer, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` plus `a[s]` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` plus `a[b]` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[b]` times `k+1` plus `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[s]` times `k+1` plus `sp`, `k` is an integer minus 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `k` being an integer minus 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
