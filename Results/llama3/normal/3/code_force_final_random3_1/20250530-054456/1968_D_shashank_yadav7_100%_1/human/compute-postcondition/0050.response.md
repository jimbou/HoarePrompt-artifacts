Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n, i is equal to n, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus n times a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus n times a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of bm and a[b] times (k-n+1) plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of sm and a[s] times (k-n+1) plus sp, k is equal to 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if bm is greater than sm, or 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, or 'Draw' is printed if bm is equal to sm.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The variable i is now equal to n, indicating that the loop has executed n times. The variables b and s have been updated to be equal to p[b] minus 1 minus n and p[s] minus 1 minus n, respectively. The variables sp and bp have been updated to be equal to the value of a at index s plus n times a[s] and the value of a at index b plus n times a[b], respectively. The variables bm and sm have been updated to be equal to the maximum of bm and a[b] times (k-n+1) plus bp and the maximum of sm and a[s] times (k-n+1) plus sp, respectively. The variable k is now equal to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Finally, the program prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on the values of bm and sm.
