Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is an integer equal to `a[b]` times `k` minus one times `a[b]`, `sm` is an integer equal to `a[s]` times `k` minus one times `a[s]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either 'Bodya' is printed if `bm` is greater than `sm`, or 'Sasha' is printed if `bm` is less than `sm`, or 'Draw' is printed if `bm` is equal to `sm`.***
