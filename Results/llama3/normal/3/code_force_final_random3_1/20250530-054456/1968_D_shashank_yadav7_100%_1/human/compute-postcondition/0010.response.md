Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is an integer minus 1, `s` is an integer minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[b]` times `k` plus `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[s]` times `k` plus `sp`, `k` is an integer minus 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the same state as before, with the same values for `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`. The only change is that `k` is now one less than its previous value. If `k` is now 0, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
