The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n` or `k` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is equal to `n` plus 1 or `k` is minus 1 and `t` must be greater than `i` so `t` is a positive integer greater than `n` or `k` is not equal to 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `i` is equal to `n` plus 1 or `k` is minus 1, `n` is an integer, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` plus the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` plus the sum of `a[b]` for all iterations, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[b]` times `k` plus `bp` for all iterations, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[s]` times `k` plus `sp` for all iterations, `k` is an integer minus the number of iterations, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if `bm` is greater than `sm`, or 'Sasha' is printed if `bm` is less than `sm`, or 'Draw' is printed if `bm` is equal to `sm`.**
