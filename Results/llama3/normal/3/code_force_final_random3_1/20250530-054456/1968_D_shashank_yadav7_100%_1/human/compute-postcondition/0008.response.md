Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than 0, b is an integer minus 1, s is an integer minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, k is an integer minus 1.**

The code updates the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` based on the values of `p`, `a`, and `k`. The value of `b` is updated to be the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, and the value of `s` is updated to be the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the product of the value of `a` at index `b` or `s` and `k` plus the original value of `bp` or `sp`. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the value of `a` at index `s` and `b`, respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
