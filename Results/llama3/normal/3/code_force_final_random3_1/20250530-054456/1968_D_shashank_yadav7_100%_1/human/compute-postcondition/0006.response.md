Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer and its current value is 0, `b` is an integer minus 1, `s` is an integer minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` times 1, `sm` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` times 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement that we broke out of.
