Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer minus 1, `b` is an integer minus 1, `s` is an integer minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` times `k+1`, `sm` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` times `k+1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been decremented by 1. The values of `bm` and `sm` are now equal to the value of `a` at index `b` times `k+1` and the value of `a` at index `s` times `k+1` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
