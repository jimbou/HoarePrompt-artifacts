This function simulates a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on a given permutation and array. It takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of four lines: the number of elements, the number of rounds, and the initial positions of Bodya and Sasha. The function then simulates the game for each test case, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation, and calculating their scores. Finally, it prints the winner of each game, either Bodya, Sasha, or a draw, based on their final scores.
