Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1 minus 1, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1 minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of `bm` and `a[b]` times (`k-1`) plus `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s]` times (`k-1`) plus `sp`, `k` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
