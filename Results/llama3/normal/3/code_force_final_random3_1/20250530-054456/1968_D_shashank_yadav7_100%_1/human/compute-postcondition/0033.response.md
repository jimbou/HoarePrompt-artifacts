Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n, i is equal to n plus 1 or k is minus 1, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b, bm is an integer equal to a[b] times k, sm is an integer equal to a[s] times k, k is an integer minus the number of iterations, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if bm is greater than sm, or 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, or 'Draw' is printed if bm is equal to sm.**
