Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n integers representing the array a. n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The permutation p and array a are lists of positive integers.
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to t, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[p[p...[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1...]] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[p[p...[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1...]] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s] plus ... plus a[s] t times, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b] plus ... plus a[b] t times, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[p...[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1...]] times (k-t+1) plus a[p[p...[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1...]] plus a[p[p...[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1...]] times k, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[p...[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1...]] times (k-t+1) plus a[p[p...[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1...]] plus a[p[p...[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1...]] times k, and k is equal to -t+1. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than or equal to sm, 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, otherwise 'Draw' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function simulates a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on a given permutation and array. It takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of four lines: the number of elements, the number of rounds, and the initial positions of Bodya and Sasha. The function then simulates the game for each test case, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation, and calculating their scores. Finally, it prints the winner of each game, either Bodya, Sasha, or a draw, based on their final scores.
