Output: **t is a positive integer greater than n, i is equal to n, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus n times a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus n times a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of bm and a[b] times (k-n+1) plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of sm and a[s] times (k-n+1) plus sp, k is equal to 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The current value of bm is greater than the current value of sm, and 'Bodya' is printed**
