The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of four lines, the first line of the first test case is accepted as input and converted to an integer, which is assigned to `t`. The remaining lines of the first test case and all other test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of three lines: n integers representing the permutation p, n integers representing the array a, and the remaining lines of the test cases.**
