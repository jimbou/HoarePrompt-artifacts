Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is an integer minus 1, `s` is an integer minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[b]` times `k` plus `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[s]` times `k` plus `sp`, `k` is an integer minus 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
