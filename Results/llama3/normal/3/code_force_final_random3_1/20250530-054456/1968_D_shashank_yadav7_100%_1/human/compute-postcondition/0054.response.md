Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than n, i is equal to n, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus n times a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus n times a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of bm and a[b] times (k-n+1) plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of sm and a[s] times (k-n+1) plus sp, k is equal to 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if bm is greater than sm, or 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, or 'Draw' is printed if bm is equal to sm. Additionally, bm is less than or equal to sm***
