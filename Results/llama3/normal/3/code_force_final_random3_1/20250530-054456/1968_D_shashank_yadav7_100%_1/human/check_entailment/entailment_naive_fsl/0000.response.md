Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The issue lies in the way the program updates the scores of Bodya and Sasha. The program only updates the scores when the players move to a new position, but it does not consider the case when the players stay at the same position.

In the problem description, it is stated that the players' scores increase by a_x when they are at position x, regardless of whether they move or stay. However, the program only increments the scores when the players move to a new position, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the case where Bodya and Sasha both start at position 1, and the permutation is [1, 2, 3, 4]. If both players stay at position 1 for the entire game, their scores should increase by a_1 for each turn. However, the program will not update their scores correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this issue, the program should update the scores of Bodya and Sasha at each turn, regardless of whether they move or stay at the same position.
