Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, b is an integer minus 1, s is an integer minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b, bm is an integer equal to the value of a at index b times k, sm is an integer equal to the value of a at index s times k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0, and `i` remains 0. The variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are assigned integer values from the input, with `b` and `s` being decremented by 1. The lists `p` and `a` are populated with `n` integers from the input. The variables `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, and `k`. Stdin now contains one less test case.
