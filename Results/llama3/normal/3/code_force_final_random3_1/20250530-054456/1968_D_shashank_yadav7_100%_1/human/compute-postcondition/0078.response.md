Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is 2, n is greater than 1, b is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[b] - 1] times (k-1) plus a[b] plus a[b] times k, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[s] - 1] times (k-1) plus a[s] plus a[s] times k, and k is either -2 or -3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
