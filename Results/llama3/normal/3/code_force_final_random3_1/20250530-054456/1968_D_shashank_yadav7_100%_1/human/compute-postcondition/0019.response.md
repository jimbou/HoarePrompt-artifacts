Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is equal to n or k is 0, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus the sum of a[s] for all iterations, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus the sum of a[b] for all iterations, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp for all iterations, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp for all iterations, k is an integer minus the number of iterations, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` is either equal to the number of iterations `n` or the loop was terminated early because `k` reached 0. The indices `b` and `s` have been updated to point to the next elements in the list `p`, and the sums `sp` and `bp` have accumulated the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` for all iterations. The maximum values `bm` and `sm` have been updated to reflect the maximum values of `a[b]` times `k` plus `bp` and `a[s]` times `k` plus `sp` for all iterations. The value of `k` has been decremented by the number of iterations, and the input stream `stdin` has been consumed by one test case.
