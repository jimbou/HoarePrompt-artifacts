Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of three lines: n integers representing the permutation p, n integers representing the array a, and the remaining lines of the test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is equal to n or k is 0, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus the sum of a[s] for all iterations, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus the sum of a[b] for all iterations, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp for all iterations, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp for all iterations, k is an integer minus the number of iterations, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if bm is greater than sm, or 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, or 'Draw' is printed if bm is equal to sm.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than n, i is equal to n, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus n times a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus n times a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of bm and a[b] times (k-n+1) plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of sm and a[s] times (k-n+1) plus sp, k is equal to 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if bm is greater than sm, 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, or 'Draw' is printed if bm is equal to sm.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is equal to n, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s] plus ... plus a[s] n times, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b] plus ... plus a[b] n times, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] times (k-1) plus a[p[b] - 1] plus a[p[b] - 1] times k, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] times (k-1) plus a[p[s] - 1] plus a[p[s] - 1] times k, and k is equal to -n. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than or equal to sm, 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, otherwise 'Draw' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
