To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer minus the number of iterations, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is an integer equal to `a[b]` times `k`, `sm` is an integer equal to `a[s]` times `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if `bm` is greater than `sm`, or 'Sasha' is printed if `bm` is less than `sm`, or 'Draw' is printed if `bm` is equal to `sm`.**
