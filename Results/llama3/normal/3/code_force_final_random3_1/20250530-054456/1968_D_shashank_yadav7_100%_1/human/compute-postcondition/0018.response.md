Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, n is greater than 2, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s] plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b] plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp, k is an integer minus 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`. The new values of `b` and `s` are calculated by subtracting 1 from the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the calculated values of `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, respectively. The value of `k` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code snippet. The state of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code snippet.
