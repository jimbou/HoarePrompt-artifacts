Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer minus the number of iterations minus one, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is an integer equal to `a[b]` times `k` minus one times `a[b]`, `sm` is an integer equal to `a[s]` times `k` minus one times `a[s]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if `bm` is greater than `sm`, or 'Sasha' is printed if `bm` is less than `sm`, or 'Draw' is printed if `bm` is equal to `sm`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decremented by one, which affects the values of `bm` and `sm` as they are equal to `a[b]` times `k` and `a[s]` times `k` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
