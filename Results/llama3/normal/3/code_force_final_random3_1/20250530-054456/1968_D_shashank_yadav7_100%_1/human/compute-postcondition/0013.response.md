Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is greater than 1, b is an integer, s is an integer, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s] plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b] plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp, k is an integer minus 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`. The new values of `b` and `s` are calculated by subtracting 1 from the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the product of `a[b]` and `k` plus `bp`, and the product of `a[s]` and `k` plus `sp`, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged.
