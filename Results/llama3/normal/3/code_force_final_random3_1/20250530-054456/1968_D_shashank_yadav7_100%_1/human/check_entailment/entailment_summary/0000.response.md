Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game between Bodya and Sasha based on the given permutation and array. The program updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation, calculates their scores, and determines the winner of each game.

The program uses a greedy approach to maximize the scores of Bodya and Sasha. It keeps track of the maximum score that can be achieved by each player at each step, considering the possibility of staying at the same position or moving to the next position in the permutation.

The program also handles the case where the number of rounds is greater than the length of the permutation, by breaking the loop when the number of rounds reaches zero.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic of the game and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
