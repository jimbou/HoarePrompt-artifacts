State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is greater than 1, b is an integer minus 1, s is an integer minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] times k plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] times k plus sp, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, k is an integer minus 1.**
