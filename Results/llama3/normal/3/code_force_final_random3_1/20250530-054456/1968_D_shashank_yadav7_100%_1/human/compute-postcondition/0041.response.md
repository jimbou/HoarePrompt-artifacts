Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1 minus 1, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1 minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of `bm` and `a[b]` times (`k-1`) plus `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s]` times (`k-1`) plus `sp`, `k` is decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` is decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their current values and the product of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively with the new value of `k` (`k-1`) plus `bp` and `sp` respectively. All other conditions and values remain the same.
