Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1 minus `n`, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1 minus `n`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is an integer equal to `a[b]` times `k`, `sm` is an integer equal to `a[s]` times `k`, and `k` is either 0, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
