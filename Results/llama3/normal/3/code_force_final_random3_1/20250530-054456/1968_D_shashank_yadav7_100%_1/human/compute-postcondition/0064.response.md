Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is equal to n+1, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s, bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b, bm is an integer equal to a[b] times k, sm is an integer equal to a[s] times k, k is equal to 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

The code reads two lines of input from stdin, each containing multiple integers. The first line assigns the values of n, k, b, and s from the input. The second line assigns the values of p and a from the input. The values of b and s are decremented by 1. The values of sp, bp, bm, and sm are calculated based on the values of a, b, s, and k. The value of k is not changed. The code does not print anything. The values of t and i are not affected by the code.
