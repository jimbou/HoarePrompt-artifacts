The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of three lines: n integers representing the permutation p, n integers representing the array a, and the remaining lines of the test cases.**
