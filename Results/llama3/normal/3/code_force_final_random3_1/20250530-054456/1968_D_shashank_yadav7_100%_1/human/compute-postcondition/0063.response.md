The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is greater than `n`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n+1`.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than n+1, i is equal to n+1, n is an integer, b is an integer equal to p[b] minus 1 minus n, s is an integer equal to p[s] minus 1 minus n, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to the value of a at index s plus n times a[s], bp is an integer equal to the value of a at index b plus n times a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of bm and a[b] times (k-n+1) plus bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of sm and a[s] times (k-n+1) plus sp, k is equal to 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either 'Bodya' is printed if bm is greater than sm, 'Sasha' is printed if bm is less than sm, or 'Draw' is printed if bm is equal to sm.**
