The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than n, `i` is 2, `n` must be  greater than 2, `b` is an integer equal to `p[b]` minus 1 minus 1 minus 1, `s` is an integer equal to `p[s]` minus 1 minus 1 minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `s` plus `a[s]` plus `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `b` plus `a[b]` plus `a[b]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of `bm` and `a[b]` times `(k-1)` plus `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s]` times `(k-1)` plus `sp`, `k` is decreased by 1, and if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise we continue with the next iteration, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**
