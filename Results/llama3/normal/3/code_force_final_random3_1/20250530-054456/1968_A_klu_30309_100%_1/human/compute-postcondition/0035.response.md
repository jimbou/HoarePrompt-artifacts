The only object in the loop head is variable  x and list test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 test cases the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 test cases, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 test cases and the x is the third test case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that maximizes `max_sum`, `x` is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + `y`, `max_sum` is the maximum of all `current_sum` values, `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`.**
