Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the maximum of the current_sum and the previous max_sum, best_y is the value of y if current_sum is greater than the previous max_sum, otherwise it is the previous best_y.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The `gcd_val` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is updated to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. The `max_sum` is updated to be the maximum of the current `current_sum` and the previous `max_sum`, and `best_y` is updated to be the value of `y` if `current_sum` is greater than the previous `max_sum`, otherwise it remains the same.
