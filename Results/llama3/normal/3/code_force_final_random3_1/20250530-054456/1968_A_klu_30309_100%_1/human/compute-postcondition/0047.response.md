Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that maximizes max_sum, x is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is in the range from x - 3 to 1 (exclusive), gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is either the original max_sum or the new current_sum if current_sum is greater than the original max_sum, best_y is either the original best_y or the new y if current_sum is greater than the original max_sum.**

The code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Then, it calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. The values of `max_sum` and `best_y` are updated only if `current_sum` is greater than the original `max_sum`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
