Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the maximum of the current_sum and the previous max_sum, best_y is the value of y if current_sum is greater than the previous max_sum, otherwise it is the previous best_y.**

The code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y using the math.gcd function and assigns it to gcd_val. Then, it calculates the current_sum by adding gcd_val and y. The values of t, test_cases, results, x, and y remain unchanged. The previous values of max_sum and best_y are not affected by the code snippet, so they retain their original values.
