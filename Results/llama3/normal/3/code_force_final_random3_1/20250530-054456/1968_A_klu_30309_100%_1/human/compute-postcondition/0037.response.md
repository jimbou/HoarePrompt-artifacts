To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 1 and `y` is in the range from `x - 1` to 1 (exclusive). Since `x` is already stated to be greater than 1, we need to adjust `y` to be within this range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that maximizes `max_sum`, `x` is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `y` is in the range from `x - 1` to 1 (exclusive), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1**
