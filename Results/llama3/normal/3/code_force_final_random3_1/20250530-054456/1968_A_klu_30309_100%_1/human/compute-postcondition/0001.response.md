The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 1 test case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 test case and the x is the first test case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must have at least 1 test case, x is the first test case in the list**
