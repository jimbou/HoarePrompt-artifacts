Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list, `x` is the last test case in the original `test_cases` list, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in the range from `x` - 1 to 1 (exclusive), and `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `test_cases` list is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The `results` list contains the optimal `best_y` value for each test case. The variables `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, which corresponds to the last test case in the original `test_cases` list.
