The code initializes two variables: `max_sum` and `best_y`. The first line assigns 0 to `max_sum`, and the second line assigns 1 to `best_y`. These assignments do not depend on any previous values or variables, so they do not affect the initial state in any way.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, test_cases must have at least 1 test case, x is the first test case in the list, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1**
