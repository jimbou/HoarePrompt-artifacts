Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t.
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list, `x` is the last test case in the original `test_cases` list, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in the range from `x` - 1 to 1 (exclusive), and `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the value of `best_y` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list. `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`, which is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in the range from `x` - 1 to 1 (exclusive), where `x` is the last test case in the original `test_cases` list, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, and `y` is 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of positive integers `test_cases` as input, where each integer in `test_cases` is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. It calculates the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor and a number `y` for each test case in `test_cases`, where `y` ranges from `x-1` to 1 (exclusive) for each test case `x`. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer is the value of `y` that maximizes the sum for each test case.
