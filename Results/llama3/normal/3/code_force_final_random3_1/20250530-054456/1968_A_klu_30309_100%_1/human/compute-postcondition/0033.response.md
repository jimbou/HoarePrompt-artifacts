Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the maximum of all current_sum values, best_y is the value of y that maximizes max_sum.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the loop has iterated over all possible values of y from x-1 down to 1, updating max_sum and best_y whenever a larger current_sum is found. The final values of max_sum and best_y are the maximum current_sum and the corresponding value of y, respectively.
