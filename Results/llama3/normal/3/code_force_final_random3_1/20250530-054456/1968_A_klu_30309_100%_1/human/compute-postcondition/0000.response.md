Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is an empty list**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `results` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables, `t` and `test_cases`, remain unchanged. The length of `test_cases` is still equal to `t`, and all elements in `test_cases` are still positive integers between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
