#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t.

    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list, `x` is the last test case in the original `test_cases` list, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in the range from `x` - 1 to 1 (exclusive), and `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the value of `best_y` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list. `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`, which is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in the range from `x` - 1 to 1 (exclusive), where `x` is the last test case in the original `test_cases` list, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, and `y` is 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of positive integers `test_cases` as input, where each integer in `test_cases` is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. It calculates the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor and a number `y` for each test case in `test_cases`, where `y` ranges from `x-1` to 1 (exclusive) for each test case `x`. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer is the value of `y` that maximizes the sum for each test case.
