Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, x is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, and the current value of current_sum is greater than max_sum***
