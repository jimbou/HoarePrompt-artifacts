Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is 0, and best_y is 1.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
    gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
    current_sum = gcd_val + y
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
        best_y = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, if current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is updated to y, otherwise max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the maximum of the current_sum and the previous max_sum, best_y is the value of y if current_sum is greater than the previous max_sum, otherwise it is the previous best_y.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, if current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is updated to y, otherwise max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
