To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 1, and `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, `results` is a list containing the value of best_y, `x` is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `y` is x - 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of x and y, `current_sum` is gcd_val + y, `max_sum` is 0, and `best_y` is 1**
