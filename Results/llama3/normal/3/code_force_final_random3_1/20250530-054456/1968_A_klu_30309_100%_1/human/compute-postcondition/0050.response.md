Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that maximizes max_sum, x is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and 1, current_sum is gcd_val + 1, max_sum is the maximum value of gcd_val + y for y in the range from x - 1 to 1 (exclusive), and best_y is the value of y that maximizes max_sum.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has iterated over all possible values of y from x-1 down to 1, and for each y, it has calculated the greatest common divisor of x and y, added y to it to get the current sum, and if this sum is greater than the maximum sum found so far, it has updated the maximum sum and the best y. After all iterations, the maximum sum and the best y are the maximum sum and the y that maximizes this sum, respectively.
