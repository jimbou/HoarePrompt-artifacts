Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the value of `best_y` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list. `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`, which is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in the range from `x` - 1 to 1 (exclusive), where `x` is the last test case in the original `test_cases` list, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, and `y` is 1.**
