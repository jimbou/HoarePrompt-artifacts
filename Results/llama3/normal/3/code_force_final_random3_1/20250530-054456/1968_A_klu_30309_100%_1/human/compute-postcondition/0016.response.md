Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, x is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the maximum of the current_sum and the previous max_sum, and best_y is the value of y when max_sum is updated. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is updated to y. Otherwise, max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all possible values of y from x-1 down to 1, and for each iteration, it has calculated the greatest common divisor of x and y, and the current sum of the gcd and y. The maximum sum and the corresponding best y have been updated accordingly. The loop has now finished executing, and the final values of y, gcd_val, current_sum, max_sum, and best_y are as described above.
