Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, x is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the maximum of the current_sum and the previous max_sum, and best_y is the value of y when max_sum is updated. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is updated to y. Otherwise, max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.***
