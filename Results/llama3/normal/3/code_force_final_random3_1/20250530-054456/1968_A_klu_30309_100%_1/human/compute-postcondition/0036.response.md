Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that maximizes max_sum, x is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1.**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables except for `max_sum` and `best_y`. The first line sets `max_sum` to 0, and the second line sets `best_y` to 1. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.
