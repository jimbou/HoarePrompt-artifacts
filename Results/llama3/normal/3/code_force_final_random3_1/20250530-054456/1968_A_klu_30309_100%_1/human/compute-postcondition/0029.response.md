The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is x - 2. For the loop to execute again, y must be decreased by 1, so y is x - 3.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the maximum of the current_sum and the previous max_sum, best_y is the value of y if current_sum is greater than the previous max_sum, otherwise it is the previous best_y.**
