Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, x is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, max_sum is the updated maximum sum, best_y is the updated best y, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, and current_sum is greater than its previous value which is now equal to max_sum, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, and current_sum is gcd_val + y.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd()` function and assigns it to `gcd_val`. The second line calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. 

Since `x` is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, and `y` is `x - 2`, `y` is also greater than -1. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is a positive integer. Therefore, `gcd_val` is a positive integer. 

The value of `current_sum` is the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. Since `gcd_val` is a positive integer and `y` is greater than -1, `current_sum` is greater than its previous value which is now equal to `max_sum`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the final output state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of `gcd_val` and `current_sum` that are modified by the code.
