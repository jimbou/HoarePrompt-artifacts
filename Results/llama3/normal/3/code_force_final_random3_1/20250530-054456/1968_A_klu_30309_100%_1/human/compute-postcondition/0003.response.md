To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 1, because the range starts from `x - 1` and goes down to 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must have at least 1 test case, `x` is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`**
