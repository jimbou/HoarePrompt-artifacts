Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that maximizes max_sum, x is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is in the range from x - 3 to 1 (exclusive), gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the new current_sum, best_y is the new y.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum` and the value of `y` to `best_y`. The `break` statement exits the loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code, its effect is not applicable here. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only changes are the updates to `max_sum` and `best_y`, which now hold the values of `current_sum` and `y`, respectively.
