Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that maximizes `max_sum`, `x` is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in the range from `x` - 1 to 1 (exclusive), and `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`.**

The code appends the value of `best_y` to the `results` list. The value of `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`, which is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in the range from `x` - 1 to 1 (exclusive). The value of `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1. The value of `x` is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1. The value of `y` is 1. The value of `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1. The value of `t` is a positive integer, and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. The list `test_cases` contains positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`.
