Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, x is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y.**

In this output state, the values of t, test_cases, results, x, max_sum, and best_y remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of y is still x - 1, as it was in the initial state. The code introduces two new variables: gcd_val and current_sum. The value of gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, which is calculated using the math.gcd function. The value of current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y.
