To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The objects involved are `y`, `x`, and the `range` object.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is in the range from `x - 2` to 1 (exclusive). To execute the loop again, `y` must be decremented by 1, since the `range` object is iterating in reverse order.

The state of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop.

The `range` object is not a state variable, but rather a control structure that generates values for `y`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `y`, which must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that maximizes `max_sum`, `x` is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `y` is in the range from `x - 3` to 1 (exclusive), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` and `best_y` is equal to `y`, otherwise `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
