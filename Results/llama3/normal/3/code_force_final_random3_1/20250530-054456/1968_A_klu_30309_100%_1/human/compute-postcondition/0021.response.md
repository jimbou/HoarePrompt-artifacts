Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is 0, and best_y is 1**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables except for `gcd_val` and `current_sum`. The first line calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns it to `gcd_val`. The second line adds `y` to `gcd_val` and assigns the result to `current_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged.
