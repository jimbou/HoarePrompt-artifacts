Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, x is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, max_sum is equal to the previous value of current_sum, best_y is equal to y which is x - 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, and current_sum is greater than its previous value which is now equal to max_sum.**
