Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that maximizes max_sum, x is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is in the range from x - 1 to 1 (exclusive), gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, and the current value of current_sum is greater than the current value of max_sum which is 0, best_y is y, max_sum is current_sum**
