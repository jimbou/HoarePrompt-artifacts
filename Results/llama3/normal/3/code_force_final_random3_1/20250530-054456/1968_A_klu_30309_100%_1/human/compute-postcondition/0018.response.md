To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `test_cases`. 

Since `x` is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, which is a positive integer, we can conclude that `test_cases` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the next test case in the list, and `test_cases` should have at least one more element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + `y`, `max_sum` is the maximum of the `current_sum` and the previous `max_sum`, and `best_y` is the value of `y` when `max_sum` is updated.**
