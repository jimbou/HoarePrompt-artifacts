Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that maximizes max_sum, x is the third test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is in the range from x - 1 to 1 (exclusive), gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `y`, `max_sum`, or `best_y`. The first line calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. The second line calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. Since the values of `x` and `y` are not modified, the values of `gcd_val` and `current_sum` are determined by the original values of `x` and `y`.
