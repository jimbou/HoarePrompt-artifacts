Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is equal to current_sum, and best_y is equal to y.**

The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`, making `max_sum` equal to `current_sum`. It also assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`, making `best_y` equal to `y`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
