Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, x is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, y is x - 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is the maximum of the current_sum and the previous max_sum, and best_y is the value of y when max_sum is updated.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is updated to the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. If `current_sum` is greater than the previous `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y`.
