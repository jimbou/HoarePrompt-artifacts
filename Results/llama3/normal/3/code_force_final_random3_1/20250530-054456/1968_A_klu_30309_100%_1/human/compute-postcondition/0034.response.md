Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that maximizes `max_sum`, `x` is the second test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + `y`, `max_sum` is the maximum of all `current_sum` values, `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes `max_sum`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains the value of `best_y` that maximizes `max_sum`, in addition to the other values it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged.
