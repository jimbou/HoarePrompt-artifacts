To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `y`, `x`, and the `range` object.

According to the loop head, `y` is initialized to `x - 1` and decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `x - 1`, and `x` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `x - 2`.

The state of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`, are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `max_sum` is the updated maximum sum, `best_y` is the updated best y, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is greater than its previous value which is now equal to `max_sum`.**
