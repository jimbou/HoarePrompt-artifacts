Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + `y`, `max_sum` is the maximum of the `current_sum` and the previous `max_sum`, and `best_y` is the value of `y` when `max_sum` is updated.**

In this output state, the value of `best_y` has been appended to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships. The `results` list now contains the value of `best_y`, which is the value of `y` when `max_sum` was last updated.
