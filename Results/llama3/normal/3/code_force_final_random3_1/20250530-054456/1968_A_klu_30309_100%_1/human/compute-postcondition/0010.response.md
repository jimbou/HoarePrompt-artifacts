Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and the length of test_cases is equal to t, results is an empty list, x is the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1, max_sum is the updated maximum sum which is equal to current_sum, best_y is the updated best y which is equal to y, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, and current_sum is greater than its previous value which is now equal to max_sum, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, and current_sum is gcd_val + y.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`, effectively updating `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. The second line assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`, effectively updating `best_y` to be equal to `y`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. 

The initial state of the variables remains the same, except for `max_sum` and `best_y`, which are updated to be equal to `current_sum` and `y`, respectively. The value of `x` is still the first test case in the list and must be greater than 1. The value of `y` is still `x - 2`. The value of `gcd_val` is still the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. The value of `current_sum` is still greater than its previous value, which is now equal to `max_sum`, and is still equal to `gcd_val + y`.
