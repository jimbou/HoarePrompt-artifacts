Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 2, t is a valid integer (3 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '09', time is 'PM'**

The code snippet assigns the value '09' to the variable h1 and the value 'PM' to the variable time. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
