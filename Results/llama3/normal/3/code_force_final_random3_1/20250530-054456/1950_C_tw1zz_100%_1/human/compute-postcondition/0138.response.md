Postcondition: ***h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time is a string representing the time of day (AM/PM), h1 is a string representing the hour part of the input time in 12-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 1, t is a valid integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '11'. Otherwise, the program processes the input time in the 24-hour format and converts it to a 12-hour format. If the hour part of the input time is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '12'. If the hour part is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively. If the hour part is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. The minute part of the input time remains unchanged.***
