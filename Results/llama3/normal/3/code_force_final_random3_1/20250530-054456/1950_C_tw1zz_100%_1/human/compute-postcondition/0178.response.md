Postcondition: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 2, t is a valid integer (3 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '23', then h1 is '11' and time is 'PM'. Otherwise, if h is '00', then h1 is '12' and time is 'AM'. For other values of h, h1 and time are determined based on the value of h: if h is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively; if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', or '22', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', or '10' respectively. The minute part of the input time remains unchanged, and this is printed: the adjusted hour h1, the minute m, and the time of day (AM/PM) in the format "h1:m time".**
