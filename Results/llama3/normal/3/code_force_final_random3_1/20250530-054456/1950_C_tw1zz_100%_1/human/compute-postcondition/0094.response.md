Postcondition: ***h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time and h1 are strings. If h is '03', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '03'. If h is '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '12'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 0, t is a valid integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).***
