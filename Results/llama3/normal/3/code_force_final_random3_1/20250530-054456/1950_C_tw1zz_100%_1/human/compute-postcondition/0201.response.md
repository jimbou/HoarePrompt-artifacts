The code prints the adjusted hour, minute, and time of day (AM/PM) in the format "h1:m time". 

The value of h1 is determined based on the value of h: 
- if h is '01', then h1 is '01' 
- if h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively 
- if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively 
- if h is '00', then h1 is '12'.

The value of time is determined based on the value of h: 
- if h is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM' 
- if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then time is 'PM' 
- if h is '00', then time is 'AM'.

The value of m is the minute part of the input time which remains unchanged.

Output: **h1 (where h1 is the adjusted hour based on the value of h): m (where m is the minute part of the input time) time (where time is the time of day, either 'AM' or 'PM', based on the value of h)**
