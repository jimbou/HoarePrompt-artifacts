To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If the input is a valid integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains a single integer `t` followed by `t` strings of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. So for the loop to be executed, `stdin` must contain a valid integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and `_` is now 0.

State: **`stdin` contains a valid integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) followed by `t` strings of length 5 with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, `_` is 0**
