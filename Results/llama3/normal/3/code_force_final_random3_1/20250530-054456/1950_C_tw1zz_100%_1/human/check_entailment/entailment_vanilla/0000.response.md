Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads a string representing the time in 24-hour format and splits it into hours and minutes.

3. The program then uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and whether it's AM or PM.

4. The program correctly handles the conversion for all possible hours in 24-hour format, including the edge cases where the hour is 00 or 12.

5. Finally, the program prints the converted time in 12-hour format.

However, the program can be simplified and made more efficient by using the modulo operator to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and a conditional statement to determine whether it's AM or PM.

Despite the inefficiency, the program is logically correct and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
