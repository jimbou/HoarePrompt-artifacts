The only objects in the loop head are variable _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _.  If the variable _ is less than t the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is a valid integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440). So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 1 and t is a valid integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 1440).
State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time and h1 are strings. If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '12'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. stdin contains t-2 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 1, t is a valid integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 1440).**
