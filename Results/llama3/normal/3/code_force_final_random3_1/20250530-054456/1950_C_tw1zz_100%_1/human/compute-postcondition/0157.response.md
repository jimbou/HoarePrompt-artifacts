Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 2, t is a valid integer (3 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '05', time is 'AM'**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign specific values to the variables `h1` and `time`. The first line sets `h1` to `'05'`, and the second line sets `time` to `'AM'`. These assignments do not depend on the initial values of `h1` and `time`, so the previous values are overwritten. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
