Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time is 'PM', h1 is '11', m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 1, t is a valid integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '11' to the variable h1. The second line assigns the string 'PM' to the variable time. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state of the variables h, m1, m, _, and t remains unchanged, as well as the contents of stdin.
