Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly converts 24-hour time to 12-hour time with AM/PM indicator. The program handles all possible cases for hours from 00 to 23 and correctly determines whether the time is AM or PM. The use of if-elif-else statements ensures that the correct hour and AM/PM indicator are printed for each input time.

Correctness: **True**
