Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 2, t is a valid integer (3 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '07', time is 'PM'.**

The code assigns the value '07' to `h1` and 'PM' to `time`. No other variables are affected. The value of `h1` is now '07', and the value of `time` is now 'PM'. The values of `h`, `m1`, `m`, `_`, and `t` remain unchanged. Stdin remains unchanged as well.
