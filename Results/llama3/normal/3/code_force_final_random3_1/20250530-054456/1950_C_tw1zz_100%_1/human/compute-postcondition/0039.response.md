Output State: **h is '13', m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time is 'PM', h1 is '01', stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 0, t is a valid integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '01' to the variable h1. The second line assigns the string 'PM' to the variable time. 

The initial state of h is '13', and it remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The initial state of m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, and it also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The initial state of time is an empty string, but it is assigned the value 'PM' by the code. The initial state of h1 is an empty string, but it is assigned the value '01' by the code. The initial state of stdin, _, and t remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
