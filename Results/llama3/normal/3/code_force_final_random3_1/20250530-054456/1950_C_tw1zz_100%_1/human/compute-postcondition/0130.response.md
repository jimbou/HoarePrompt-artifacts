Postcondition: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 1, t is a valid integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '19', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '07'. If h is not '19', then if h is '20', '21', '22', or '23', time is 'PM' and h1 is '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'.**
