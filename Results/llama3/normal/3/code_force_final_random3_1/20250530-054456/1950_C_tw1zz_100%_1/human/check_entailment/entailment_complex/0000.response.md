Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format with AM/PM indicator. It iterates over a series of time inputs in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and prints the equivalent time in 12-hour format (hh:mm AM/PM) for each input.

The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by using a series of if-elif statements to determine the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and whether it is AM or PM.

However, the program can be improved for readability and efficiency by using a more concise approach, such as using the modulo operator to determine the hour in 12-hour format and a conditional statement to determine whether it is AM or PM.

Despite this, the program is logically correct and will produce the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
