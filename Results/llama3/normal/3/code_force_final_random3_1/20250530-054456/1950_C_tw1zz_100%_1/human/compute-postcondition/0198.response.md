Postcondition: **The program takes an input time in the 24-hour format, adjusts the hour part based on the value of h, and prints the adjusted hour, minute, and time of day (AM/PM) in the format "h1:m time". If h is '03', then h1 is '03' and time is 'AM'. For other values of h, h1 and time are determined based on the value of h: if h is '01', '02', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01', '02' respectively; if h is '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', then h1 is '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11' and time is 'AM'; if h is '12', then h1 is '12' and time is 'PM'; if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11' respectively; if h is '00', then h1 is '12' and time is 'AM'. The minute part of the input time remains unchanged.**
