Postcondition: ***h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time is a string representing AM or PM, h1 is a string representing the hour part of the input time in 12-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 1, t is a valid integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '15', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '03'. Otherwise, the program processes the input time in the 24-hour format and converts it to a 12-hour format: if the hour part of the input time is '16', it sets the time to 'PM' and the hour part to '04'; if the hour part is '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', it sets the time to 'PM' and the hour part to '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively; if the hour part is '00', it sets the time to 'AM' and the hour part to '12'. The minute part of the input time remains unchanged.***
