Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it handles all possible cases for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time. It correctly identifies the AM/PM time and adjusts the hour accordingly. The program also handles the edge cases, such as 00:00 and 12:00, correctly.

The program uses a series of if-elif statements to check the hour and determine the corresponding 12-hour time. This approach may seem repetitive, but it ensures that all possible cases are handled correctly.

One potential improvement to the program would be to use a more concise approach, such as using the modulo operator to determine the 12-hour time. However, the current implementation is correct and easy to understand.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
