Output State: **h is '21', m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time is 'PM', h1 is '09', stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 0, t is a valid integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440)**.

The code snippet assigns the string '09' to the variable h1 and the string 'PM' to the variable time. The values of h, m1, stdin, _, and t remain unchanged.
