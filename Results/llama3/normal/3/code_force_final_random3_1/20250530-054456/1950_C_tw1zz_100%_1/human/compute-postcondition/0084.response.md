Postcondition: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time and h1 are strings. If h is '13', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '14', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '02'. If h is '15', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '03'. If h is '16', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '04'. If h is '17', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '05'. If h is '18', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '06'. If h is '19', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '07'. If h is '20', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '08'. If h is '21', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '09'. If h is '22', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '10'. If h is '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '11'. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. For all other values of h, time and h1 are not changed. stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 0, t is a valid integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).**
