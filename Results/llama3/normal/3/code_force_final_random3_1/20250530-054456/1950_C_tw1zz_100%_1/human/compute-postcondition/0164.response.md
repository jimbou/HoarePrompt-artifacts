Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 2, t is a valid integer (3 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '12', time is 'PM'.**

The code assigns the value '12' to h1 and 'PM' to time. No other variables are affected. The value of h1 is now '12', and the value of time is now 'PM'. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
