The code prints the time in the 12-hour format with AM/PM, where the hour part is determined based on the value of `h` and the minute part remains unchanged.

Here's the breakdown:

- `h1` is the hour part in 12-hour format, determined based on the value of `h`. If `h` is between '01' and '12', `h1` is the same as `h`. If `h` is between '13' and '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12'.
- `m` is the minute part of the input time, which remains unchanged.
- `time` is 'AM' if `h` is between '01' and '12', and 'PM' if `h` is between '13' and '23'. If `h` is '00', `time` is 'AM'.

So, the output will be the time in the 12-hour format with AM/PM, where the hour part is adjusted based on the value of `h` and the minute part remains the same.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour part in 12-hour format, m is the minute part, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**
