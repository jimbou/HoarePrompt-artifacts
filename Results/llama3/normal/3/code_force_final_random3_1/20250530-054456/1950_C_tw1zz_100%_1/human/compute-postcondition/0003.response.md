Output State: **h is '01', m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time is 'AM', h1 is '01', stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 0, t is a valid integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440)**

The code assigns the string '01' to the variable h1 and the string 'AM' to the variable time. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
