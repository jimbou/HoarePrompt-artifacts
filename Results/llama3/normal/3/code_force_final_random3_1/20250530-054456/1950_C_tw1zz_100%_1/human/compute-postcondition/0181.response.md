Postcondition: **The program takes an input time in the 24-hour format, adjusts the hour part based on the value of h, and prints the adjusted hour, minute, and time of day (AM/PM) in the format "h1:m time". If h is '20', then h1 is '08' and time is 'PM'. If h is '21', '22', or '23', then h1 is '09', '10', or '11' respectively and time is 'PM'. If h is '00', then h1 is '12' and time is 'AM'. For other values of h, h1 and time are determined based on the value of h: if h is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively; if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', or '19', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', or '07' respectively. The minute part of the input time remains unchanged.**
