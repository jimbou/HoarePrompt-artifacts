Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format with AM/PM indicator. It accepts a series of time inputs in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and prints the equivalent time in 12-hour format (hh:mm AM/PM) for each input.

The program uses a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and whether it's AM or PM based on the input hour in 24-hour format. The minutes remain the same.

The program correctly handles all possible hours in 24-hour format, from 00 to 23, and converts them to the corresponding hours in 12-hour format, from 01 to 12, with the correct AM/PM indicator.

However, the program can be improved for better readability and maintainability by using a more concise and efficient approach, such as using the modulo operator to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format.

Correctness: **True**
