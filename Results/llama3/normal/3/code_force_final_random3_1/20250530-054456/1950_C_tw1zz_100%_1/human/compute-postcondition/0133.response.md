Postcondition: **The program processes the input time in the 24-hour format and converts it to a 12-hour format. If the hour part of the input time is '16', it sets the time to 'PM' and the hour part to '04'. Otherwise, it checks the hour part and sets the time and hour part accordingly: if the hour part is '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', it sets the time to 'PM' and the hour part to '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively; if the hour part is '00', it sets the time to 'AM' and the hour part to '12'. The minute part of the input time remains unchanged.**
