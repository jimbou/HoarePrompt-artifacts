Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, time is an empty string, h1 is an empty string, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 0, t is a valid integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440)**

In this output state, the variable `h` now holds the hour part of the input time as a string, and `m1` holds the minute part of the input time as a string. The variable `time` remains an empty string, and `h1` is also an empty string. The value of `_` is still 0. The variable `t` remains a valid integer between 1 and 1440. Stdin now contains one less string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
