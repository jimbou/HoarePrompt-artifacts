Output: **h is a string representing the hour part of the input time, m1 is a string representing the minute part of the input time, m is a string representing the minute part of the input time, _ is 1, t is a valid integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 1440), stdin contains t-3 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is not '01', then time and h1 are determined based on the value of h: if h is '02', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '02'; if h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively; if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively; if h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. The minute part of the input time remains unchanged, and this is printed: the adjusted hour h1, the minute m, and the time of day (AM/PM) in the format "h1:m time"**
