Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing a single list with two elements, both 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for s in a:
    x, y = S[-1]
    if s == '0':
        x += 1
    else:
        y += 1
    S.append([x, y])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the first character of `a` is 0, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, if the first character of `a` is 1, then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing three lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, and the third list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, with the same values as the second list, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing four lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, the third list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, with the same values as the second list, the fourth list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if `s` is '0', then `x` is incremented by 1, otherwise `y` is incremented by 1, `x` is equal to the second last element of `S` and `y` is equal to the last element of `S`, `s` is the second character of `a`, and `stdin` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
