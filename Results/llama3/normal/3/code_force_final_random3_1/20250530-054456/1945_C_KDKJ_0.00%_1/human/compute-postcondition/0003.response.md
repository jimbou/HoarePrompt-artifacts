Output State: **`_` is 1, stdin contains one input: an integer that must be greater than 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code snippet is an empty function call, which means it does not modify any variables or perform any operations. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The value of `_` is still 1, the stdin still contains one input: an integer that must be greater than 1, and the function `func_1()` has already been executed.
