Reasoning: 
The problem requires finding the position of the house after which the road should be laid to satisfy the condition that at least half of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice. The condition is met when the number of residents on the left side who want to live on the left side is at least half of the total number of residents on the left side, and the number of residents on the right side who want to live on the right side is at least half of the total number of residents on the right side.

Function `func_1()` correctly implements this logic. It first calculates the cumulative sums of 0 and 1 in the string `a`, which represents the number of residents who want to live on the left and right sides, respectively. Then, it iterates over the cumulative sums and checks if the condition is met for each position. If the condition is met, it updates the answer with the current position if it is closer to the middle of the string than the previous answer.

Function `func_2()` simply executes `func_1()` a specified number of times, equal to the input integer provided.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
