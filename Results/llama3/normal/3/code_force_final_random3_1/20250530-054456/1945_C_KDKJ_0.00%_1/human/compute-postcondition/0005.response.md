Output State: **`_` is 2, stdin contains one input: an integer that must be greater than 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code snippet is simply a function call to `func_1()`, which has already been executed according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables or the stdin.
