Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, the third list contains two elements, x and y, where if the second character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, the fourth list contains two elements, x and y, where if the third character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, and so on, the last list contains two elements, x and y, where x is the total number of 0's in the original string a and y is the total number of 1's in the original string a, ans is 0, satisfy is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, the third list contains two elements, x and y, where if the second character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, the fourth list contains two elements, x and y, where if the third character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, and so on, the last list contains two elements, x and y, where x is the total number of 0's in the original string a and y is the total number of 1's in the original string a, satisfy is 0, stdin is empty, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is n, rsum is n. If left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n/2 and i is less than or equal to the absolute difference between n/2 and ans, then ans is set to i. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, the third list contains two elements, x and y, where if the second character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, the fourth list contains two elements, x and y, where if the third character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, and so on, the last list contains two elements, x and y, where x is the total number of 0's in the original string a and y is the total number of 1's in the original string a, satisfy is 0, stdin is empty, left is the first element of the second list in S, lsum is the sum of the elements in the second list in S, right is the second element of the last list in S minus the second element of the second list in S, rsum is n minus the sum of the elements in the second list in S, i is 1, and if left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, if the absolute difference between n / 2 and i is less than or equal to the absolute difference between n / 2 and ans, then ans is set to 1, otherwise ans remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the first character of `a` is 0, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, if the first character of `a` is 1, then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, the third list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the second character of `a` is 0, then `x` is incremented by 1, otherwise `y` is incremented by 1, the fourth list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the third character of `a` is 0, then `x` is incremented by 1, otherwise `y` is incremented by 1, and so on, the last list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the total number of 0's in the original string `a` and `y` is the total number of 1's in the original string `a`, `satisfy` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `left` is the first element of the second list in `S`, `lsum` is the sum of the elements in the second list in `S`, `right` is the second element of the last list in `S` minus the second element of the second list in `S`, `rsum` is `n` minus the sum of the elements in the second list in `S`, `i` is 2, and if `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, `ans` is set to 1 if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, otherwise `ans` is set to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
