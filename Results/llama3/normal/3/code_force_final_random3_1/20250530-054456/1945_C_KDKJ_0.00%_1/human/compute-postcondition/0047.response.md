Functionality: **This function reads an integer n and a string a of length n from standard input, where n is greater than or equal to 3 and a consists only of 0 and 1. It then calculates the cumulative sums of 0 and 1 in the string a and finds the index of the cumulative sum that is closest to the middle of the string. Finally, it prints the index of the cumulative sum that is closest to the middle of the string.**
