Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, the third list contains two elements, x and y, where if the second character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, the fourth list contains two elements, x and y, where if the third character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, and so on, the last list contains two elements, x and y, where x is the total number of 0's in the original string a and y is the total number of 1's in the original string a, satisfy is 0, stdin is empty, ans is the index of the list in S that is closest to the middle of S, left is the first element of the last list in S, lsum is the sum of the elements in the last list in S, right is 0, rsum is 0, i is n-1, and the index of the list in S that is closest to the middle of S is being printed**
