The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i` + 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, the third list contains two elements, x and y, where if the second character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, the fourth list contains two elements, x and y, where if the third character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, and so on, the last list contains two elements, x and y, where x is the total number of 0's in the original string a and y is the total number of 1's in the original string a, satisfy is 0, stdin is empty, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is n, rsum is n, i is 1, ans is 0**
