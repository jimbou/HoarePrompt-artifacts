The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than or equal to 1) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to input is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains one input: an integer that must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
