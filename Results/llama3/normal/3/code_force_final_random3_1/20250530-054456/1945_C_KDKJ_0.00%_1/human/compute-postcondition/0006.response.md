Output State: `_` is the integer input minus 1, stdin contains one input: an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed that many times.

This output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `_` has been incremented to the value of the input integer minus 1, indicating that the loop has executed that many times. The stdin still contains the original input integer, which is greater than or equal to 1. The function `func_1()` has been executed the same number of times as the value of the input integer.
