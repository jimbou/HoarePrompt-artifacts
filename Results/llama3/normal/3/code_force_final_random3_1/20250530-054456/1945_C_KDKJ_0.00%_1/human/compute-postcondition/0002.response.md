To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `stdin` contains one input: an integer that must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, the condition `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `_`, which is 0. This means that the input from `stdin` must be greater than 0.

Since the input from `stdin` is an integer, we can increment `_` by 1 to reflect the next iteration.

The state of the function `func_1()` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`_` is 1, stdin contains one input: an integer that must be greater than 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
