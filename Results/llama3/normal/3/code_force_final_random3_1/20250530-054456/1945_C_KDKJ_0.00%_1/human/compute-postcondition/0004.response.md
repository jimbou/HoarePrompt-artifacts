The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, the input is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again the input must be greater than 2.
State: **`_` is 2, stdin contains one input: an integer that must be greater than 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
