Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, `stdin` is empty, and the values of `x` and `y` are determined by the first two characters of `a`.**
