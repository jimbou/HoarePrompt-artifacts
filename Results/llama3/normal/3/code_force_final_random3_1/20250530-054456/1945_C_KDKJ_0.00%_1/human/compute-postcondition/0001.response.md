Output State: **`_` is 0, stdin contains one input: an integer that must be greater than 0, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin still contains one input, which is an integer greater than 0, as the code snippet does not modify or consume this input. Additionally, the function `func_1()` has been executed, but since its implementation is not provided, we cannot determine its specific effects on the program state.
