Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, the third list contains two elements, x and y, where if the second character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, the fourth list contains two elements, x and y, where if the third character of a is 0, then x is incremented by 1, otherwise y is incremented by 1, and so on, the last list contains two elements, x and y, where x is the total number of 0's in the original string a and y is the total number of 1's in the original string a, satisfy is 0, stdin is empty, left is the first element of the second list in S, lsum is the sum of the elements in the second list in S, right is the second element of the last list in S minus the second element of the second list in S, rsum is n minus the sum of the elements in the second list in S, i is 1, ans is 0**

The code executes as follows: 

The first line assigns the value of the first element of the second list in S to left. Since the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, left becomes either 1 or 0.

The second line assigns the value of the sum of the elements in the second list in S to lsum. Since the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, lsum becomes either 1 or 1.

The third line assigns the value of the second element of the last list in S minus the second element of the second list in S to right. Since the last list contains two elements, x and y, where x is the total number of 0's in the original string a and y is the total number of 1's in the original string a, and the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, right becomes either the total number of 0's in the original string a minus 0 or the total number of 1's in the original string a minus 1.

The fourth line assigns the value of n minus the sum of the elements in the second list in S to rsum. Since the second list contains two elements, x and y, where if the first character of a is 0, then x is 1 and y is 0, if the first character of a is 1, then x is 0 and y is 1, rsum becomes either n minus 1 or n minus 1.

No other variables are affected.
