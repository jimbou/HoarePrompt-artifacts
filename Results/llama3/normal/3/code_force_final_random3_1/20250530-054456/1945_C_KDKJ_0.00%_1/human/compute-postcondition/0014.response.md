Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing three lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, and the third list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, with the same values as the second list, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is still a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` now has three lists, the first two lists remain the same, and the third list is a copy of the second list, which contains `x` and `y` values determined by the first two characters of `a`. The `stdin` remains empty.
