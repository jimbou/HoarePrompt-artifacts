Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described in the problem statement. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from standard input, where `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and `a` consists only of 0 and 1. It then calculates the cumulative sums of 0 and 1 in the string `a` and finds the index of the cumulative sum that is closest to the middle of the string. Finally, it prints the index of the cumulative sum that is closest to the middle of the string.

`func_2` executes `func_1` a specified number of times, equal to the input integer provided.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the cumulative sums of 0 and 1 in the string `a` and finds the index of the cumulative sum that is closest to the middle of the string. It also correctly prints the index of the cumulative sum that is closest to the middle of the string.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
