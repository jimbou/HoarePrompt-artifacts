Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing four lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the first character of `a` is 0 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 0, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character of `a` is 1 and the second character is 1, then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, the third list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, with the same values as the second list, the fourth list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if `s` is '0', then `x` is incremented by 1, otherwise `y` is incremented by 1, `x` is equal to the second last element of `S` and `y` is equal to the last element of `S`, `s` is the second character of `a`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the list `S` now contains four lists, where the fourth list contains the updated values of `x` and `y` based on the value of `s`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.
