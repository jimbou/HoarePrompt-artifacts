The code prints the index of the list in S that is closest to the middle of S.
Since S contains n+1 lists and n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, the middle of S will be the list at index (n+1)//2.
Therefore, the print statement will output the index (n+1)//2.
Output: **(n+1)//2 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
