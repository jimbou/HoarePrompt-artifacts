Output State: `_` is equal to the input integer minus 1, stdin contains one input: an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed a number of times equal to the input integer.

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable `_` will hold the value of the input integer minus 1, the input integer will still be present in stdin, and the function `func_1()` will have been executed as many times as the value of the input integer.
