Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the input string, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1`, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] for all `i` in range(1, n).
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the first element is `n-1`, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n]. If `res` is '>', `res` is '>', and `mini` is the value of `item`. Otherwise, `res` is '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the third element in the list `arr`, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item], `res` is a string input from the user, stdin contains no input. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the fourth element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`, and this is also printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
