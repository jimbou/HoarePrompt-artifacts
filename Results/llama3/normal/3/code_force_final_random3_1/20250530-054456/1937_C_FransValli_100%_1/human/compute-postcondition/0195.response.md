Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=' which is the input from stdin, If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 1, 2 and 3, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 2 and 3, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing four elements which are 0, 1, 2 and 3, and this is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is 3), stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `arr` now depends on the value of `res`, which is either '<', '>' or '='. If `res` is '<', then `arr` contains the elements 1, 2, and 3. If `res` is '>', then `arr` contains the elements 0, 2, and 3. If `res` is '=', then `arr` contains the elements 0, 1, 2, and 3. The value of `mini` is still not n-1 if `res` is '<', and is still n-1 if `res` is '>'. The printed message remains the same.
