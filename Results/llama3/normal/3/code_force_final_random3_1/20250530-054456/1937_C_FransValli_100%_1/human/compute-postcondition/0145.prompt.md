Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is `n-1` and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing `n-1` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`. `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`. The stdin contains no input. The following is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is either 0 or `n-1`, followed by `maxi` again, followed by `i` which is `n`, and this is printed with flush=True.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is 1, and the input has been read from stdin which contains one input: either '<' or '>'. If the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is 1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in the list, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` (which is either the fourth element in the list `arr` or either 0 or `n-1`) repeated twice, followed by the value of `item` (which is the fourth element in the list `arr`) repeated twice, and stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
