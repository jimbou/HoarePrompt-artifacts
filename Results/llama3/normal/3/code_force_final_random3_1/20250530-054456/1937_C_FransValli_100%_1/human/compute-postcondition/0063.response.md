Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the third element in the list `arr`, `mini` is the third element in the list `arr`, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item], `res` is a string input from the user, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be equal to the third element in the list `arr`, which is also the value of `item`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the printed output remains the same. The stdin still contains no input.
