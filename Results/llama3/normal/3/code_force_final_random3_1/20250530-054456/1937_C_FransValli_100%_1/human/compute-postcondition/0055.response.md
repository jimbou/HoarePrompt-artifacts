Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the input string, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the first element is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1`, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n]**


In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 0. The value of `i` is still `n`. The value of `maxi` remains the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. The value of `res` is now the first character of the input string. The value of `arr` remains a list containing at least 2 elements, with the first element being `n-1`. The value of `mini` remains `n-1`. The stdin contains the rest of the input string. The printed output remains the same: ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n].
