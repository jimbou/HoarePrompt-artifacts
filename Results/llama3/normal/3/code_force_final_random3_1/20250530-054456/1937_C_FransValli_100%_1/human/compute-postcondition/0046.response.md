Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3, stdin contains the rest of the input string.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element 3, which is the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the rest of the input string.
