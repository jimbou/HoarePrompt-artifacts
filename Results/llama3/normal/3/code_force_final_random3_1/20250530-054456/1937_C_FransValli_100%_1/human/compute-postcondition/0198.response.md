Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=' which is the input from stdin. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing one element which is n-1, and `mini` is either n-1 or not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and n-2, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, and this is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is n-1), stdin contains no input.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The value of `n` remains unchanged, `i` is now equal to `n`, `item` is still `n-1`, and `maxi` is still `n-1`. The value of `res` is either '<', '>' or '=' which is the input from stdin. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing one element which is `n-1`, and `mini` is either `n-1` or not `n-1`. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and `n-2`, and `mini` is `n-1`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`, and this is printed: ? `maxi` (which is `n-1`) `arr[0]` (which is 1 if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '>', and 0 if `res` is '=') `maxi` (which is `n-1`) `i` (which is `n-1`), stdin contains no input.
