Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, and `_` is an integer. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and `res` is '<'. If `res` is '>', then `maxi` is 0 and `res` is '>', and `mini` is `n-1`. In both cases, '?' followed by the current value of `maxi`, followed by the current value of `maxi`, followed by the current value of `i`, followed by the current value of `i`, has been printed.***
