Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the last element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `res` is the input string, and `stdin` is empty. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it has iterated over all elements in the list `arr`. After the loop finishes executing, the value of `item` will be the last element in the list. The value of `mini` will be the last element in the list if the input string `res` is '>', otherwise it will be either `n-2` or `1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The input string `res` is still the input from stdin, and stdin is empty.
