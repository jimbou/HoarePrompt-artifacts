Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is 1, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, `res` is either '<' or '>', and the input has been read from stdin which contains one input: either '<' or '>'**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, `item`, and `mini` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `res` is updated to either '<' or '>' based on the input read from stdin. The input has been read from stdin, which now contains one input: either '<' or '>'.
