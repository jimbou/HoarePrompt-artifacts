Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `arr`, and the value of `item` is now the last element in the list, which is `n-1`. The value of `mini` depends on the last input from stdin, which is either '<' or '>'. If the input is '>', then `mini` is set to the last element in the list, which is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains either 0 or `n-1`. The other variables, `n`, `i`, and `maxi`, remain unchanged.
