Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 2 and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 2. `res` is either '<', '=' or neither '<' nor '='. The stdin contains no input. The following is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is either 0 or 2, followed by `maxi` again, followed by `i` which is 2, and this is printed with flush=True.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing one element which is 2, because the value of `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The print statement has been executed, printing the specified values with flush=True.
