Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is '? 0 0 1 1', stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged. The variable `res` is assigned the string '? 0 0 1 1' which is the input accepted from the user. Since stdin contains no input initially, it remains empty after the execution of the code.
