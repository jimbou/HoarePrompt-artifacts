Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. `res` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains the rest of the input string. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1. If `res` is '>', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 2.***
