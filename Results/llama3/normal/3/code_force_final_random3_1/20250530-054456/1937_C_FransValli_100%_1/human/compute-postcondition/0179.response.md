Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `mini` is n-1, `res` is '=' and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains two elements: 0 and 1. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values, and the stdin remains empty.
