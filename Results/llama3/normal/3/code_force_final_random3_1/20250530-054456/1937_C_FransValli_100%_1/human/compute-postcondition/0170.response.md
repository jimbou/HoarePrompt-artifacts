Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0, `item` is n-1, `res` is either '<' or '>', `maxi` is n-1, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is n-1.**

The code assigns a new value to the variable `arr`, which is now a list containing a single element, 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still at least `n`, `i` is still `n`, `item` is still `n-1`, `res` is still either '<' or '>', `maxi` is still `n-1`, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is still `n-1`. The stdin is still empty.
