The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and less than `n`, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 2 and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2. The stdin contains no input. The following is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is either 0 or 2, followed by `maxi` again, followed by `i` which is 3, and this is printed with flush=True.**
