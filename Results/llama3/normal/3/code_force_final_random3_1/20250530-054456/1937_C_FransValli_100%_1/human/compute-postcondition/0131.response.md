Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is 1, `mini` is 1, and the input has been read from stdin which contains one input: either '<' or '>'. The current value of `res` is '>'**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to 1, which is the value of `item`. The other variables remain unchanged. The input from stdin still contains either '<' or '>', and the current value of `res` is still '>'.
