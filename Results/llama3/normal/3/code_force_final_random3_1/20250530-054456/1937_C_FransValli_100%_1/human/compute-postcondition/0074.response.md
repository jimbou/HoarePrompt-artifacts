The only variable in the loop head is the loop counter `_` and the input from the user, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from the user. If the input from the user is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the input from the user is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, the input from the user must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`, and this is also printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. The '!' symbol, the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, and the last element in the list `arr` which is `mini` are printed.**
