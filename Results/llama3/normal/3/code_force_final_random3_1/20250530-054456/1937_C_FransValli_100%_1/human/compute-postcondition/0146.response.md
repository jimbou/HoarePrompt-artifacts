The code prints an exclamation mark, the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', and either 0 or `n-1` depending on the current value of `res`. Where `n` is an integer greater than 1, `res` is either '<' or '>', and `n-1` is the last element of the list `arr` containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`.
Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the largest integer less than n such that the previous res is '<', and mini is either 0 or n-1 depending on the current value of res)**
