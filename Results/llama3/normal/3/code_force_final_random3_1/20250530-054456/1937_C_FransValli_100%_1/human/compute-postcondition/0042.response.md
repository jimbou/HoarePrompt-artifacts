The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. `res` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains the rest of the input string. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 2. If `res` is '>', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 3. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing three elements 1, 2 and 3.**
