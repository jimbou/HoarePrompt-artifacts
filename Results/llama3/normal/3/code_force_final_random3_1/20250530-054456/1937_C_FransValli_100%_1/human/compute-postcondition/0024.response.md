The code prints a string that starts with '?', followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', then the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, then again the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', and finally the value of `i` which is 1.
Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where maxi is the largest integer less than n such that res is '<')**
