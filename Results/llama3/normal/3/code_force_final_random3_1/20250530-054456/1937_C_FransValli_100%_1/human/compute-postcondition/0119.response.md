Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `res` is either '<', '=' or '>', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 2 if `res` is '<', a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2 if `res` is '=', and a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2 if `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `item` is 0, and the stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated based on the input, and the list `arr` and the value of `item` are updated accordingly. The values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain the same. The stdin is still empty.
