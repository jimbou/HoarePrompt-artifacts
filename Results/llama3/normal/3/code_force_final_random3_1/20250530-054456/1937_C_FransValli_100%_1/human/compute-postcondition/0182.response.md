The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, and stdin is empty. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing a single element which is 1, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1.**
