Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in the list, and the input has been read from stdin which contains one input: either '<' or '>', If the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is 1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` which is either 0, 1 or `n-1`, followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item` which is the third element in the list `arr`, followed by the value of `item` again**
