Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, i is n, maxi is 0, arr is a list containing at least n elements, the first element is n-1, item is the last element in the list arr, res is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]. If res is '>', then mini is the last element in the list arr, and this is also printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. The '!' symbol, the largest integer less than n such that res is '<' which is maxi, and the last element in the list arr which is mini are printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        maxi = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string containing one character which is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or any other single character. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2 and `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string containing one character which is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or any other single character, stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
