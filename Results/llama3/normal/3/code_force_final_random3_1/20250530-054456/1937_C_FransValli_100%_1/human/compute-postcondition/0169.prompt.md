Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, maxi is 0, i is n, arr is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, item is n-1, res is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of res is '>', then mini is n-1. Otherwise, mini is either 0 or n-1, and _ is an integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        maxi = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, and `_` is an integer. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and `res` is '<'. If `res` is '>', then `maxi` is 0 and `res` is '>', and `mini` is `n-1`. In both cases, '?' followed by the current value of `maxi`, followed by the current value of `maxi`, followed by the current value of `i`, followed by the current value of `i`, has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, `_` is an integer, `res` is either '<' or '>', `maxi` is 2, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-1`. The stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program's state remains unchanged if `res` is '>', otherwise, the program's state remains the same as the initial state, with `n` being at least 4, `i` being 3, `arr` containing `n` elements from 0 to `n-1`, `item` being `n-1`, and `res` being either '<' or '>', and `maxi` being 3, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-1`, and the stdin is empty, and the output is ? 3 3 3 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
