The only objects in the loop head are variables  item and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 elements, item is either `n-2` or `1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the item is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the third element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, and `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`, and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. If `res` is '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
