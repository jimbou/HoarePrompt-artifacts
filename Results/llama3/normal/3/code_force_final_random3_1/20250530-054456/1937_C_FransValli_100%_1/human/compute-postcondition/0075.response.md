Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is n, maxi is 0, arr is a list containing at least n elements, the first element is n-1, item is the last element in the list arr, res is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]. If res is '>', then mini is the last element in the list arr, and this is also printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. The '!' symbol, the largest integer less than n such that res is '<' which is maxi, and the last element in the list arr which is mini are printed.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, the value of `n` is updated. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `maxi`. Since `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', the value of `maxi` is updated to 0. No other variables are affected.
