Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<'. The new `res` is the input string from stdin. If the new `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing two elements 3 and 3. If the new `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing three elements 1, 2 and 3. If the new `res` is '>', `arr` is a list containing three elements 1, 3 and 3. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing four elements 1, 2, 3 and 3. and this is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<' , the first element of the list `arr` , the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<' , 3, stdin contains the rest of the input string.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 3, to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The new `res` is still the input string from stdin, and the value of `maxi` is still the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<'. The printed output remains the same.
