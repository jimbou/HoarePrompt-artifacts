Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and this is printed: '!', maxi (which is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'), and mini (which is either 0, `n-1` if `res` is '<' or `n-1` if `res` is '>')**
