Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string containing one character which is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or any other single character, stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
