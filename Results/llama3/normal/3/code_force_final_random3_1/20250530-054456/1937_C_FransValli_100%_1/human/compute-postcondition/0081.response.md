Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 1, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is '<', `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `maxi`. Since `i` is 1, `maxi` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `maxi` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
