Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1, `item` is 0, `res` is a string input from the user and it is '='**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains two elements: 0 and 1. The rest of the variables retain their initial values.
