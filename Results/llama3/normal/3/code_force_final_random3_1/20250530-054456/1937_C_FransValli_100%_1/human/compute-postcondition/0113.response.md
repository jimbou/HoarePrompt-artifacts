Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 1 and 2 and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2. `res` is either '<', '=' or neither '<' nor '='. The stdin contains no input. The following is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is either 0 or 1, followed by `maxi` again, followed by `i` which is 2, and this is printed with flush=True.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The print statement has been executed, displaying the specified output with flush=True.
