Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=', if `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 1 and 2, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2, and this is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is 2)**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `n` is still at least 3, and `i` is still 2. The value of `item` and `maxi` is still n-1. The value of `res` is still either '<', '>' or '='. If `res` is '<', then `arr` now contains two elements: 1 and 2, and `mini` is still not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` now contains two elements: 0 and 2, and `mini` is still n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` now contains three elements: 0, 1 and 2, and the same message is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is 2).
