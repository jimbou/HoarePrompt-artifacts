Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). Each test case contains one input: an integer (the size of the permutation).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`, and this is also printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. The '!' symbol, the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, and the last element in the list `arr` which is `mini` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and this is printed: '!', maxi (which is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'), and mini (which is either 0, `n-1` if `res` is '<' or `n-1` if `res` is '>')

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the last element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `res` is the input string, and `stdin` is empty. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `maxi` which is n-1, followed by the value of `mini` which is either n-1 (if `res` is '>') or either n-2 or 1 (if `res` is not '>')




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
