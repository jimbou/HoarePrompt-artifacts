Output: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, and stdin is empty. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing a single element which is 1, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1, and this is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is 2)**
