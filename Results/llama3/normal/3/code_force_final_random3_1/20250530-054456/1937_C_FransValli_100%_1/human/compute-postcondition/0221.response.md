Output: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the last element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `res` is the input string, and `stdin` is empty. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `maxi` which is n-1, followed by the value of `mini` which is either n-1 (if `res` is '>') or either n-2 or 1 (if `res` is not '>')**
