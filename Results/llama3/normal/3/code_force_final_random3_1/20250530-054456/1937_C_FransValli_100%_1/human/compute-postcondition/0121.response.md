Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `res` is either '<', '=' or '>', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 2 and 3 if `res` is '<', a list containing four elements which are 0, 1, 2 and 3 if `res` is '=', and a list containing three elements which are 0, 2 and 3 if `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `item` is 0, and the stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains an additional element, which is 3, and its length has increased by 1. The rest of the variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
