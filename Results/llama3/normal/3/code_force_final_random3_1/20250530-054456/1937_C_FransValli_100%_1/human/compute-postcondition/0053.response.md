Based on the precondition, the code prints a string that starts with '?', followed by the value of `mini` (which is `n-1`), another `mini` (also `n-1`), the value of `item` (which is not explicitly defined but is presumably an element of the `arr` list), and another `item` (same as before), and finally, the `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately displayed.

Output: **? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]**
