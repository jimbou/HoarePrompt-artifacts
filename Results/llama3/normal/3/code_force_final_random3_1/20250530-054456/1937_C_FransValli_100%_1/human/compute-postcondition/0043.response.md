The `print` statement will print a string containing several values separated by spaces. Here's a breakdown of each value:

- `?`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `maxi`: This is the largest integer less than `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 3, `maxi` will be an integer less than `n`, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the value of `n`.
- `arr[0]`: The value of `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', `arr` contains a single element 3, so `arr[0]` will be 3. If `res` is '=', `arr` contains two elements 1 and 2, so `arr[0]` will be 1. If `res` is '>', `arr` contains two elements 1 and 3, so `arr[0]` will be 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains three elements 1, 2, and 3, so `arr[0]` will be 1.
- `maxi`: This is the same as the first `maxi` and will have the same value.
- `i`: This is an integer with a value of 3.

Since the exact values of `maxi` and `arr[0]` depend on the values of `n` and `res`, which are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can describe their values based on the given conditions.

Output: **?, maxi (where maxi is the largest integer less than n), arr[0] (where arr[0] is 3 if res is '<', 1 if res is '=' or '>', and 1 otherwise), maxi (where maxi is the largest integer less than n), 3**
