The only objects in the loop head are variables  item and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 3 elements, item is the third element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the item is the fourth element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`.**
