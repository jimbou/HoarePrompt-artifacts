Output State: **n is at least n, i is n, arr is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, item is n-1, res is either '<' or '>', maxi is n-1, and if res is '>', then mini is n-1. The stdin is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` has reached `n`, which means the loop has finished executing. The value of `maxi` has been updated to `n-1`, indicating that the maximum value found so far is the second last element in the list `arr`. The value of `res` is either '<' or '>', depending on the comparison result in the last iteration. If `res` is '>', then `mini` remains `n-1`, indicating that the minimum value found so far is the last element in the list `arr`. The stdin is empty, indicating that all input operations have been completed. The values of `n`, `arr`, `item`, and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
