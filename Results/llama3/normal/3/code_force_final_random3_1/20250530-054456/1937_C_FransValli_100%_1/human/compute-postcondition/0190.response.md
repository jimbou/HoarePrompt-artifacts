The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '='. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 1 and 2, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2, and this is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is 3).**
