Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, stdin contains the rest of the input string.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the rest of the input string.
