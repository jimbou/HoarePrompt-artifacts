Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `res` is either '<', '=' or '>', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 3, `item` is 0, and the stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing one element which is 3, because the value of `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
