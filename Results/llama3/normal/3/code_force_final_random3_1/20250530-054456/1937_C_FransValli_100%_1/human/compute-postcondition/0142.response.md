Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` (which is either the fourth element in the list `arr` or either 0 or `n-1`) repeated twice, followed by the value of `item` (which is the fourth element in the list `arr`) repeated twice, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their previous values, but the value of `res` is updated to either '<' or '>' based on the user input. The value of `mini` is still dependent on the value of `res`, and the same print statement is still valid. However, since the input has been consumed, stdin is now empty.
