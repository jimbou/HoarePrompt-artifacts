Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the rest of the input string and is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, stdin contains the rest of the rest of the input string**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains two elements: 0 and 1. The rest of the input string remains in stdin.
