Postcondition: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is either `n-2` or `1`, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`, and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. If `res` is '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
