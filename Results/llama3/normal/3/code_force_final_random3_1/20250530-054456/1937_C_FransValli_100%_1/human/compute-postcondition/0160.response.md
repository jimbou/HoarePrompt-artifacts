Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, and `_` is an integer. `res` is either '<' or '>'. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2. If `res` is '>', then `maxi` is 1 and `mini` is `n-1`. The stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still 2, `arr` is still a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is still `n-1`, and `_` is still an integer. The value of `res` is either '<' or '>' which is obtained from the input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2. If `res` is '>', then `maxi` is 1 and `mini` is `n-1`. The stdin is empty as it has been used to obtain the value of `res`.
