Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string containing one character which is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or any other single character, if `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2 and `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be a string containing one character which is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or any other single character. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to accept the input for `res`.
