To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2.

The state of `i` is already `n`, but since the loop starts from 1, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 1.

The other variables (`arr`, `item`, `res`, and `maxi`) are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0, `item` is n-1, `res` is either '<' or '>', `maxi` is n-1, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is n-1**
