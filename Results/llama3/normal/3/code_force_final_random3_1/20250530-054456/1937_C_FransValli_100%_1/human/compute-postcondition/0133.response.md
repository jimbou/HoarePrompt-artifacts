To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for item in arr[1:]:`. This means we are iterating over the elements of the list `arr`, starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `item` is 1, which means we have already processed the second element of the list. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next element in the list.

Since `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, we know that there is at least one more element after the second element. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `item` to be the next element in the list.

The other variables in the state (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, and the input from stdin) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in the list, and the input has been read from stdin which contains one input: either '<' or '>'. If the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is 1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`**
