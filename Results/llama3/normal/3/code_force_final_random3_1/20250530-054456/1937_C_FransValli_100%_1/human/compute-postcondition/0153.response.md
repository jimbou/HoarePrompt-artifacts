Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, `item` is n-1, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is n-1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or n-1, and `_` is an integer, and this is printed: '?' followed by the current value of `maxi` which is 0, followed by the current value of `maxi` which is 0, followed by the current value of `i` which is 1, followed by the current value of `i` which is 1, and `res` is assigned the value of the input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is updated to the input value, which can be either '<' or '>'. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, `item`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is still dependent on the value of `res`. The program has printed a string in the format '?00ii' where 'i' is the current value of `i`.
