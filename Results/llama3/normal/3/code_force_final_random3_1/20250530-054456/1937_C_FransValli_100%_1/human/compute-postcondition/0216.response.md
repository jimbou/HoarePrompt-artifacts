Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `res` is the input string, `stdin` is empty, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` which is either `n-2`, `1`, or the third element in the list, followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item` which is the fourth element in the list, followed by the value of `item` again, and `res` is the input string.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `item`, `maxi`, and `arr` remain the same. The value of `res` is updated to the input string. The value of `mini` depends on the input string `res`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`. The string '?' followed by the value of `mini` twice and the value of `item` twice is printed. The stdin is empty.
