Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`, and this is also printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `i` is still `n`, and `maxi` is still the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. The list `arr` now contains at least `n` elements, with the first element being `n-1`. The variable `item` is now the last element in the list `arr`. The variable `res` is a string input from the user, and the last print statement is '? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]'. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`, and the last print statement is '? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]'.
