Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that are printed.

* `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than 2. Since `n` is greater than 2, `maxi` will be at least 2.
* `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if `res` is '<', a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', and a list containing a single element 0 otherwise. Since `res` is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `arr[0]`. However, we can describe it as the first element of the list `arr`, which is either 0 or 1.
* `i` is 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string that includes the following values:

* '?' (a literal question mark)
* `maxi`, which is the largest integer less than `n`
* `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the list `arr`, either 0 or 1
* `maxi` again
* `i`, which is 2

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where maxi is the largest integer less than n and arr[0] is the first element of the list arr, either 0 or 1)**
