Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0, `item` is n-1, `res` is either '<' or '>', `maxi` is n-1, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is n-1, and stdin is empty.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the input to the variable `res`. Since the initial state specifies that `res` is either '<' or '>', the new value of `res` will be one of these two values. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is empty because the input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
