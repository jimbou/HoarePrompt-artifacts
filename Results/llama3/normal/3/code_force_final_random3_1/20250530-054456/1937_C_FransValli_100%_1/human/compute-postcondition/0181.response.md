Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, and stdin is empty. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing a single element which is 1, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1.***
