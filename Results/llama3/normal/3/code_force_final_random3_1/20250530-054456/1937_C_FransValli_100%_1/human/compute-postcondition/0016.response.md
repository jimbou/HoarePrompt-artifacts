Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `n` is an integer greater than 3, but its value is not used in the print statement.
* `i` is 3, which is used in the print statement.
* `res` is the second character of the input string, but its value is not directly used in the print statement. However, it affects the value of `maxi`.
* `stdin` contains the rest of the input string, but it is not used in the print statement.
* `maxi` is either 3 or 2, depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 3; otherwise, `maxi` is 2.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)`

The print statement prints the following values:

* '?' is a literal string.
* `maxi` is printed twice, with its value depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 3; otherwise, `maxi` is 2.
* `i` is printed twice, with its value being 3.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 3 3 3 3** (if `res` is '<')
or
Output: **? 2 2 3 3** (if `res` is not '<')

Note that the exact output depends on the value of `res`, which is not specified in the initial state. However, based on the given information, we can provide the possible outputs.
