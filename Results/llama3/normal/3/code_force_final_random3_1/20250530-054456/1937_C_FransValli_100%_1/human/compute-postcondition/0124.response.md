Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is `n-1` and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing `n-1` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`. The stdin contains no input. The following is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is either 0 or `n-1`, followed by `maxi` again, followed by `i` which is `n`, and this is printed with flush=True.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:

*   `n` remains an integer greater than 1.
*   `i` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
*   `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', which means it is the maximum value that `i` can take while still satisfying the condition for `res` to be '<'.
*   The state of `arr` and `item` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', `arr` contains only one element, which is `n-1`, and `item` is 0. If `res` is '=', `arr` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1`, and `item` is 0. If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` contains all elements from 0 to `n-2`, and `item` is 0.
*   The stdin contains no input, indicating that all inputs have been processed.
*   The final print statement is executed with flush=True, printing '?' followed by `maxi`, the first element of `arr`, `maxi` again, and `i` which is `n`.
