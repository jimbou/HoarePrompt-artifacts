To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`). Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which does not guarantee the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 1 (the starting value of the range) and ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the input string, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] for all `i` in range(1, n)**
