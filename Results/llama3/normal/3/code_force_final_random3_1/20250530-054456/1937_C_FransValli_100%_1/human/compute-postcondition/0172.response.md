The code prints a string that includes several variables and their values. The string starts with a question mark '?', followed by the value of `maxi`, which is `n-1`. Then, it prints the first element of the list `arr`, which is 0. After that, it prints the value of `maxi` again, which is `n-1`. Finally, it prints the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **? (n-1) 0 (n-1) 1**
