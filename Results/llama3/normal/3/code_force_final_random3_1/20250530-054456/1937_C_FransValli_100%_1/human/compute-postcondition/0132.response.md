Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is 1, and the input has been read from stdin which contains one input: either '<' or '>'. If the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is 1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`***
