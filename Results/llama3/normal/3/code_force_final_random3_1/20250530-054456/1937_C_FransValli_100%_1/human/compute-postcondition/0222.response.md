Output State: **The loop has executed for the number of test cases specified in the input, and for each test case, the maximum and minimum elements in the permutation have been found and printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has completed its execution for the specified number of test cases. For each test case, the loop has successfully found the maximum and minimum elements in the permutation and has printed them in the format specified by the problem statement. The loop has iterated over each test case, finding the maximum and minimum elements, and printing the results. The loop has now completed its execution, and the program has terminated.
