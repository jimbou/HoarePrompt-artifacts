Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=', if `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 1 and 2, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2, and this is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is 2).**
