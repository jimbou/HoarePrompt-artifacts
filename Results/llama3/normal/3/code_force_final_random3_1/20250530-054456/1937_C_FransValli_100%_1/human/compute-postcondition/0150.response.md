To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we need to adjust its state to be the starting value of the range, which is 1.

The other variables (`maxi`, `arr`, `item`, `res`, `mini`, and `_`) are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, `item` is n-1, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is n-1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or n-1, and `_` is an integer**
