To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution) and the expression `int(input())`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least one integer, the loop will execute. Since `stdin` contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases), we need to ensure that this integer is at least 1.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one integer (the number of test cases) that is greater than 0**
