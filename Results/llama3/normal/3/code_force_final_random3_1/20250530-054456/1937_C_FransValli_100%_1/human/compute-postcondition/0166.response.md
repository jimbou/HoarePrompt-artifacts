Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, `_` is an integer, `res` is either '<' or '>', `maxi` is 3, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-1`. The stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 3 3 3 3**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to either '<' or '>', based on the input provided. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty, and the printed output remains the same.
