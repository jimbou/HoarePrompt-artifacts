Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is `n-1` and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing `n-1` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`. `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`. The stdin contains no input. The following is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is either 0 or `n-1`, followed by `maxi` again, followed by `i` which is `n`, and this is printed with flush=True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `mini` which is assigned the value of the first element of the list `arr`. The value of `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, depending on the current value of `res`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
