Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string, `maxi` is either 2 or 3, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: ? 1 1 2 2 ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]**.

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to a string, which is the input from the user. The value of `maxi` is still dependent on the value of `res`, but since `res` is now a string, `maxi` can be either 2 or 3. The stdin is now empty since the input has been consumed. The printed output has been updated to include the new value of `maxi` and `i`.
