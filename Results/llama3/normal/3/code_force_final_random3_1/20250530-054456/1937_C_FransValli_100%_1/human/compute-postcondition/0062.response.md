Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the third element in the list `arr`, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item], `res` is a string input from the user, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `item` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `res` is now assigned the value of the user's input, which is a string. The stdin is empty since the input has been consumed. The printed statements remain the same as in the initial state.
