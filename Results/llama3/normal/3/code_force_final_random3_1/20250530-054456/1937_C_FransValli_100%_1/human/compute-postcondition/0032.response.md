Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the rest of the input string. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, stdin contains the rest of the rest of the input string. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains the rest of the rest of the input string.***
