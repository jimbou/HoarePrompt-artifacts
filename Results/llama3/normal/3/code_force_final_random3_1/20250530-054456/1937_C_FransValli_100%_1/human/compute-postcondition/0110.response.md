Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 1 and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0. The following is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is either 0 or 1, followed by `maxi` again, followed by `i` which is 2, and this is printed with flush=True**
