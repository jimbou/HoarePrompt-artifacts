The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mini`, the value of `mini` again, the value of `item`, and the value of `item` again. 

The value of `mini` is either 0 or `n-1` where `n` is an integer greater than 1. The value of `item` is 1.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] 1 1 (where mini is either 0 or n-1)**
