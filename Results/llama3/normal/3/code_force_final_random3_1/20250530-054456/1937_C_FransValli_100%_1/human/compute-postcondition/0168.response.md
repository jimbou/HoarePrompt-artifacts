Postcondition: **The program's state remains unchanged if `res` is '>', otherwise, the program's state remains the same as the initial state, with `n` being at least 4, `i` being 3, `arr` containing `n` elements from 0 to `n-1`, `item` being `n-1`, and `res` being either '<' or '>', and `maxi` being 3, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-1`, and the stdin is empty, and the output is ? 3 3 3 3.**
