Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that are printed.

* `maxi` is `n-1`, where `n` is at least 4. So, `maxi` is at least 3.
* `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 1 and 2, so `arr[0]` is 1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2, so `arr[0]` is 0. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2, so `arr[0]` is 0.
* `i` is 3.

So, the print statement will print the following:

* '?' (a literal string)
* `maxi` (which is at least 3)
* `arr[0]` (which is 1 if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '>', and 0 if `res` is '=')
* `maxi` (which is at least 3)
* `i` (which is 3)

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3 (where maxi is at least 3 and arr[0] is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=')**
