To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to consider the possible values of `res` and their corresponding effects on the variables `arr` and `mini`.

1.  If `res` is '<', then `arr` contains a single element which is 1, and `mini` is not n-1.
    *   In this case, `arr[0]` will be 1.
2.  If `res` is '>', then `arr` contains one element which is 0, and `mini` is n-1.
    *   In this case, `arr[0]` will be 0.
3.  If `res` is '=', then `arr` contains two elements which are 0 and 1.
    *   In this case, `arr[0]` will be 0.

The value of `maxi` is given as n-1, and the value of `i` is given as 2.

Considering these possibilities, the print statement will output a string in the format '? maxi arr[0] maxi i'.

Output: **? [n-1] [arr[0]] [n-1] 2 (where n-1 is the value of maxi, arr[0] is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of res, and 2 is the value of i)**
