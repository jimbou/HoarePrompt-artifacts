Output: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, `item` is n-1, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is n-1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or n-1, and `_` is an integer, and this is printed: '?' followed by the current value of `maxi` which is 0, followed by the current value of `maxi` which is 0, followed by the current value of `i` which is 1, followed by the current value of `i` which is 1**
