To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for item in arr[1:]:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of the list `arr` starting from the second element (index 1).

The current state is:

* `n` is at least n
* `i` is n
* `item` is the third element in the list
* `maxi` is n-1
* `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements
* `res` is the input string
* `stdin` is empty
* If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `arr` to iterate over.
* The `item` variable will take on the value of the next element in the list.
* The `arr` list will not change, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Based on this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

* `n` is still at least n (no change)
* `i` is still n (no change)
* `item` is the fourth element in the list (since we've moved one element forward)
* `maxi` is still n-1 (no change)
* `arr` is still a list containing at least 3 elements (no change)
* `res` is still the input string (no change)
* `stdin` is still empty (no change)
* If `res` is '>', then `mini` is still the third element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is still either `n-2` or `1` (no change)

State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `res` is the input string, `stdin` is empty, and if `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`**
