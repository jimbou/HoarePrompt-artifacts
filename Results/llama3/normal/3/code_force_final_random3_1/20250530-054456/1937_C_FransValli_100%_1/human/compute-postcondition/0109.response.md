Based on the initial state, let's break down the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`

Here's what we know:

* `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'.
* `i` is 2 and less than `n`.
* The value of `arr` and `item` depends on the current `res`:
	+ If `res` is '<', `arr` contains one element, which is 1, and `item` is 0.
	+ If `res` is '=', `arr` contains two elements, which are 0 and 1, and `item` is 0.
	+ If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` contains one element, which is 0.

Since we don't know the exact value of `res`, we can't determine the exact value of `arr[0]`. However, we can describe it based on the possible values of `res`.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '=' or neither '<' nor '=')] [maxi] [i]**

Note that `flush=True` is a parameter that controls the buffering behavior of the print statement, but it doesn't affect the output itself.
