Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=' which is the input from stdin, `arr` is a list containing one element which is 3, `mini` is either n-1 or not n-1 depending on the value of `res`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing only the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is still dependent on the value of `res`, but its exact value is not specified. The stdin still contains no input.
