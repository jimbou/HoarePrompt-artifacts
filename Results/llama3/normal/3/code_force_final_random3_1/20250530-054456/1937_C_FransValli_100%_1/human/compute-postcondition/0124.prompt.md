Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0, `item` is 0, `res` is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is 0, and this is also printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. The '!' symbol, the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, and the last element in the list `arr` which is 0 are printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 1 and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 2 and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2. The stdin contains no input. The following is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is either 0 or 2, followed by `maxi` again, followed by `i` which is 2, and this is printed with flush=True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `res` is either '<', '=' or '>', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 3 if `res` is '<', a list containing two elements which are 2 and 3 if `res` is '=', and a list containing three elements which are 0, 2 and 3 if `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `item` is 0, and the stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
