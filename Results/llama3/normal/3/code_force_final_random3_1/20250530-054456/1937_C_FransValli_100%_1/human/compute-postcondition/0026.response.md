Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the rest of the input string, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains the rest of the rest of the input string.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the first character of the rest of the input string, and the stdin now contains the rest of the rest of the input string. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
