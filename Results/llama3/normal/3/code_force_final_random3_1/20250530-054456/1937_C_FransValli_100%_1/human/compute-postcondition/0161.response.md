The value of `maxi` is updated to `i`, which is 2. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing `n` elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`, `item` is `n-1`, and `_` is an integer. `res` is either '<' or '>'. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2. If `res` is '>', then `maxi` is 2 and `mini` is `n-1`. The stdin is empty.
