Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the input string, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] for all `i` in range(1, n).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the maximum value `maxi` has been updated to the largest integer less than `n` for which the input `res` is '<'. The input string has been consumed up to the first character, and the rest of the input string remains in the standard input. The loop has printed the string `? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]` for all values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
