Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in the list, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`.***
