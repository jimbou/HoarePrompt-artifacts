Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is the third element in the list, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is 1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and the input has been read from stdin which is now empty.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to either '<' or '>' based on the input from stdin, which is now empty. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `item` remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is determined based on the current value of `res`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is 1. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`.
