Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=', if `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing a single element which is 2, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing one element which is 2, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 2 and 1, and this is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 2 if res is '<' or '>', 2 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is 2)**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element which is 2, regardless of the value of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. The print statement is also updated to reflect the new value of `arr[0]`.
