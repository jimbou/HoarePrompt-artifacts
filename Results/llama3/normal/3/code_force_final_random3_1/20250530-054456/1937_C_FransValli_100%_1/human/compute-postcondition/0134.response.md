The code prints a string containing a question mark followed by the value of `mini` (which is either 0, 1, or `n-1` depending on the value of `res`), the value of `mini` again, the value of `item` (which is the third element in the list `arr`), and the value of `item` again.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]**
