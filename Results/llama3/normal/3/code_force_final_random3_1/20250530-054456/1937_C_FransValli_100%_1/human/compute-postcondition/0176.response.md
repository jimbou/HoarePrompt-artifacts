The code `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing the value of `i` to the variable `arr`. Since `i` is 1, `arr` is now a list containing a single element, which is 1. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing a single element which is 1, `item` is n-1, `res` is '<', `maxi` is n-1, and `mini` is not n-1, and stdin is empty.**
