Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the input string, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1`, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] for all `i` in range(1, n).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` is now `n-1`, which is the first element of the list `arr`. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `res`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The input string in stdin is still the rest of the input string, and the print statement remains the same.
