Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, maxi is 0, i is n, arr is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, item is n-1, res is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of res is '>', then mini is n-1. Otherwise, mini is either 0 or n-1, and _ is an integer**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer greater than 1, which was provided as input. The value of `maxi` has been reset to 0. The values of `i`, `arr`, `item`, and `res` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The value of `_` is now an integer, which was provided as input. The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`, but its possible values are either 0 or `n-1`.
