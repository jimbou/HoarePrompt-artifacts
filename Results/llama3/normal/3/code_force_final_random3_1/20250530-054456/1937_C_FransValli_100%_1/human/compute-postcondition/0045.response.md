Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<'. The new `res` is the input string from stdin. If the new `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If the new `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 2. If the new `res` is '>', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 3. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing three elements 1, 2 and 3. and this is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<' , the first element of the list `arr` , the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<' , 3, stdin contains the rest of the input string.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `res` has been updated to the new input string from stdin, and the value of `maxi` has been updated accordingly. The value of `arr` has also been updated based on the new value of `res`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The program has also printed a string that includes the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<', the first element of the list `arr`, the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<', and 3. The stdin now contains the rest of the input string.
