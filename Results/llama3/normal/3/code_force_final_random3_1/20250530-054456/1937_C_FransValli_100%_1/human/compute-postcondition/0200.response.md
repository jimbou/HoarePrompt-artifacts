To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `item` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute.

Based on the given conditions:

* If `res` is '<', then `arr` has only 1 element, which is `n-1`. In this case, the loop cannot execute because `arr` does not have at least 2 elements.
* If `res` is '>', then `arr` has 2 elements, which are `0` and `n-2`. In this case, the loop can execute.
* If `res` is '=', then `arr` has `n` elements, which are `0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1`. In this case, the loop can execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to have at least 2 elements. We can do this by setting `res` to '>' or '='.

Additionally, since `item` is an element of `arr`, we can set `item` to be the second element of `arr`, which is `n-2` if `res` is '>', or `1` if `res` is '='.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is either `n-2` or `1`, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '>' or '=', `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `mini` is either 0 or n-2**
