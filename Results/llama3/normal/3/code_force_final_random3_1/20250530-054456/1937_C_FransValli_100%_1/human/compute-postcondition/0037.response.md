Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 1. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `res` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains the rest of the input string.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated to the input string from stdin, and the stdin now contains the rest of the input string. The values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain the same. The value of `arr` depends on the value of `res`, which is now determined by the input string.
