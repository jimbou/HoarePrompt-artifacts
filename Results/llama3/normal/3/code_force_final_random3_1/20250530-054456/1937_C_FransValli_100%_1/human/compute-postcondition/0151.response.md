The `print` statement will print a string that includes several variables: `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i`. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is displayed immediately.

Based on the initial state, we know that `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes these values.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
