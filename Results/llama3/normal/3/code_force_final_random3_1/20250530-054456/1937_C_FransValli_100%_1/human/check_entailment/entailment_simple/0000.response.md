Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find the maximum and minimum elements in the permutation using the given query operations.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first finds the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum element. This is done using the query operation `? maxi maxi i i`, where `maxi` is the current maximum element and `i` is the current element being compared.

2. Once the maximum element is found, the program finds all elements that have the same maximum value as the maximum element. This is done using the query operation `? maxi arr[0] maxi i`, where `arr[0]` is the current minimum element and `i` is the current element being compared.

3. The program then finds the minimum element among the elements that have the same maximum value as the maximum element. This is done using the query operation `? mini mini item item`, where `mini` is the current minimum element and `item` is the current element being compared.

4. Finally, the program prints the maximum and minimum elements found.

The program correctly uses the query operations to find the maximum and minimum elements in the permutation, and it does so within the allowed number of queries (3n). Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
