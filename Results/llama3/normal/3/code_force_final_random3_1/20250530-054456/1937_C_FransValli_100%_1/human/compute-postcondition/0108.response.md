The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 1 and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0.**
