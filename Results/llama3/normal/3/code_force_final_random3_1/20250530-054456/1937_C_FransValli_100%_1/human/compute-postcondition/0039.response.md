Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 2, `res` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains the rest of the input string.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `arr` now depends on the value of `res`, which is still the input string from stdin. If `res` is '<', `arr` contains the elements 1 and 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2. Otherwise, `arr` contains the elements 0 and 2.
