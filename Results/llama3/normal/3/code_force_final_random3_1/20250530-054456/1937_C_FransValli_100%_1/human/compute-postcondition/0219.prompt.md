Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=' which is the input from stdin. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing one element which is n-1, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and n-2, and `mini` is 0. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, and `mini` is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is either `n-2` or `1`, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`, and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. If `res` is '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the third element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `res` is the input string, and stdin is empty. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `res` is the input string, and `stdin` is empty. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list and `mini` is the fourth element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` which is either `n-2`, `1`, or the third element in the list, followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item` which is the fourth element in the list, followed by the value of `item` again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
