Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? `[n-1]` `[n-1]` `[item]` `[item]`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`, and this is also printed: ? `[mini]` `[mini]` `[item]` `[item]`. The '!' symbol, the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, and the last element in the list `arr` which is `mini` are printed, and ? `[0]` `[0]` `[1]` `[1]` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to a string input from the user. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The program has printed several lines of output based on the values of `n`, `item`, `res`, `maxi`, and `mini`.
