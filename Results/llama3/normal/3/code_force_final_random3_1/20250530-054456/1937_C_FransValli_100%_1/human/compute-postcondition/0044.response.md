Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. `res` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains the rest of the input string. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 2. If `res` is '>', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 3. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing three elements 1, 2 and 3. and this is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<' , the first element of the list `arr` , the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<' , 3**
