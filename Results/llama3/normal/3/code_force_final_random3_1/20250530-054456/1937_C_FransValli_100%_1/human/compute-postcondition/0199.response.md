Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=' which is the input from stdin. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing one element which is n-1, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and n-2, and `mini` is 0. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing n elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, and `mini` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated based on the value of `arr[0]`, which depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is 0. If `res` is '=', then `mini` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
