Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the input string, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1`, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] for all `i` in range(1, n).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `i` is now equal to `n`, and `arr` contains a single element `n-1`. This is because the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, and in each iteration, it updates `i` and `arr` accordingly. After the loop finishes, `i` is equal to `n`, and `arr` contains the last element that was added to it, which is `n-1`. The other variables, `maxi`, `res`, and stdin, remain unchanged.
