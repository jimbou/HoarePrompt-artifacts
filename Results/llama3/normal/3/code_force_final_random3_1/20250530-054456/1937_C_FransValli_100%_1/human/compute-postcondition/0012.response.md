Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` is 0, `res` is the first character of the input string, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? 1 1 2 2**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the first character of the input string, and `stdin` now contains the rest of the input string. The values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain the same as in the initial state. The printed output remains the same as well.
