Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `res` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains the rest of the input string.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the rest of the input string.
