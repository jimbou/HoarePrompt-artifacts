Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 2, `res` is the first character of the input string, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? 1 1 2 2**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The input string is still being processed, and the rest of the string is available in stdin. The printed output remains the same.
