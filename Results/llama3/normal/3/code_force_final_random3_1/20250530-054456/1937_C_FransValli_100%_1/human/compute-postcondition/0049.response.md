Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<'. If the new `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If the new `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 2. If the new `res` is '>', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 3. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing three elements 1, 2 and 3. and this is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<' , the first element of the list `arr` , the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<' , 3, stdin contains the rest of the input string.***
