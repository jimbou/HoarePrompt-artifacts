Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string containing one character which is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or any other single character, `maxi` is 2, if `res` is '<', then `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their conditions and relationships are still valid.
