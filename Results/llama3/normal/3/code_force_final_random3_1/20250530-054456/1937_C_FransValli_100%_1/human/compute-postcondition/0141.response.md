Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `res` is either '<' or '>', and if the current value of `res` is '>', then `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` (which is either the fourth element in the list `arr` or either 0 or `n-1`) repeated twice, followed by the value of `item` (which is the fourth element in the list `arr`) repeated twice**
