To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0, `item` is 0, `res` is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is 0, and this is also printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. The '!' symbol, the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, and the last element in the list `arr` which is 0 are printed.**
