Postcondition: ***`n` is at least n, `i` is n, `item` is the third element in the list, `maxi` is n-1, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `res` is the input string, and stdin is empty. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`.***
