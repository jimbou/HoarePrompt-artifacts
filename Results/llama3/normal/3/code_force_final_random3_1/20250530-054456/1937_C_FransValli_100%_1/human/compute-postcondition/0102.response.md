Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 1, `item` is 0, and the current value of `res` is '<'.**

The code changes the value of `arr` to a list containing one element, which is the current value of `i`, i.e., 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
