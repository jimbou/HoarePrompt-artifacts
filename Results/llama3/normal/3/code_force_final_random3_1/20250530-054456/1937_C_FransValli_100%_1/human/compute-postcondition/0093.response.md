Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string containing one character which is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or any other single character, `maxi` is 3, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, and a new variable `maxi` is introduced and assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The list `arr` and the string `res` remain unchanged, and there is still no input in stdin.
