Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `item` is n-1, `maxi` is n-1, `res` is either '<', '>' or '=' which is the input from stdin, If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 1 and 2, and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 2, and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing three elements which are 0, 1 and 2, and this is printed: ? maxi (which is n-1) arr[0] (which is 1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '>', and 0 if res is '=') maxi (which is n-1) i (which is 3), stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is updated to the input from stdin, which can be either '<', '>' or '='. The values of `n`, `i`, `item`, and `maxi` remain the same. The value of `arr` and `mini` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `arr` contains [1, 2] and `mini` is not n-1. If `res` is '>', then `arr` contains [0, 2] and `mini` is n-1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` contains [0, 1, 2] and the specified string is printed. The stdin is now empty.
