To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is within the range from 1 to `n-1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string input from the user, and this is printed: ? `[n-1]` `[n-1]` `[item]` `[item]`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list `arr`, and this is also printed: ? `[mini]` `[mini]` `[item]` `[item]`. The '!' symbol, the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<' which is `maxi`, and the last element in the list `arr` which is `mini` are printed.**
