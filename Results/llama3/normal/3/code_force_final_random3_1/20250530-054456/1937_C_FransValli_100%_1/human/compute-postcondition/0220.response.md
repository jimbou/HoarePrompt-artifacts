The `print` statement will print an exclamation mark, followed by the value of `maxi`, and then the value of `mini`. 

The value of `maxi` is `n-1`, where `n` is at least `n`. This means `maxi` is one less than `n`.

The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-2` or `1`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `mini`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values.

Output: **!(exclamation mark), n-1 (where n is at least n), either the last element in the list or n-2 or 1 (where the value depends on the value of res)**
