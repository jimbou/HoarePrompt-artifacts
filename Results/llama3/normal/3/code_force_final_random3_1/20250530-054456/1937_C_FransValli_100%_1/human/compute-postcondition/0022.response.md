Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the input string, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] for all `i` in range(1, n).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged. The variable `arr` is newly introduced and assigned a list containing a single element 0. The stdin still contains the rest of the input string, and the print statement remains the same.
