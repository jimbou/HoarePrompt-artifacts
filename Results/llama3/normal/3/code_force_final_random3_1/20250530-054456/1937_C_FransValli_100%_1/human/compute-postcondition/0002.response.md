To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`). 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, stdin contains no input**
