Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<', `res` is the first character of the input string, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains the rest of the input string, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] for all `i` in range(1, n).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, stdin contains the rest of the input string. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, stdin contains the rest of the rest of the input string. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains the rest of the rest of the input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. `res` is the input string from stdin, stdin contains the rest of the input string. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1. If `res` is '>', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing three elements 0, 1 and 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<'. If the new `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If the new `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 2. If the new `res` is '>', `arr` is a list containing two elements 1 and 3. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing three elements 1, 2 and 3. and this is printed: '?' followed by the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<' , the first element of the list `arr` , the largest integer less than `n` such that the new `res` is '<' , 3, stdin contains the rest of the input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
