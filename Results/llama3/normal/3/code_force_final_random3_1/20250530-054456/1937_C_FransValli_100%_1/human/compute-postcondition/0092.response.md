Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, the first element is `n-1`, `item` is the last element in the list `arr`, `res` is a string containing one character which is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or any other single character, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables maintain their previous values, but the value of `res` is updated to a new character input from the user. The stdin is now empty as it has been used to input a character for `res`.
