Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1 and less than `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<'. If the current `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 1 and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and 1, and `item` is 0. If the current `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0.***
