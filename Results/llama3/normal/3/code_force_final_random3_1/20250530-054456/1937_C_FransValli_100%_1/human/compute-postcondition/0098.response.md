Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects as follows:

* `n` is an integer greater than 1.
* `i` is 1 and less than `n`.
* `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'.
* `arr` is a list containing one element which is 0.
* `item` is 0.
* `res` is a string input from the user.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`

The print statement will print the following values:

* '?' is a literal string.
* `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that `res` is '<'. Since `res` is a string input from the user, we don't know its exact value. However, we can describe `maxi` as the largest integer less than `n` that satisfies the condition `res` is '<'.
* `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`, which is 0.
* `maxi` is printed again.
* `i` is 1 and less than `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where maxi is the largest integer less than n such that res is '<')**

Note that we can't provide an exact numerical value for `maxi` since it depends on the user's input for `res`. However, we can describe its value based on the precondition.
