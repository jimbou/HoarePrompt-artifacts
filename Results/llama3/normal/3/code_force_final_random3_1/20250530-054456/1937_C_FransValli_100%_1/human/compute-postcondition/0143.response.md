Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is the largest integer less than `n` such that the previous `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `res` is either '<' or '>', `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the fourth element in the list `arr`, which is the same as the value of `item`. The other variables remain unchanged.
