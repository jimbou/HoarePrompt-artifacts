Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the character `char`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`, and `char` is the first character in the string `encoded` and is currently a key in the `mapping` dictionary.**

In this output state, the value of `mapping[char]` has been appended to the `decoded` list. The other variables remain unchanged, with `encoded` still being a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` still containing at least one key-value pair with `char` as a key, and `char` still being the first character in the string `encoded` and a key in the `mapping` dictionary.
