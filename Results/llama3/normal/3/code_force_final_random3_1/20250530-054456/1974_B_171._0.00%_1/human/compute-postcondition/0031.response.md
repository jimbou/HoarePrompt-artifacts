Output State: **The loop executes 25 times, and the dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary. The variables `encoded`, and `char` retain their original values. The variable `c` holds the value 'z'. The variable `decoded` has an additional character 'z' appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has executed one less time, and the dictionary `mapping` remains unchanged. The variables `encoded` and `char` still hold their original values. The variable `c` still holds the value 'z'. The variable `decoded` now has an additional character 'z' appended to it.
