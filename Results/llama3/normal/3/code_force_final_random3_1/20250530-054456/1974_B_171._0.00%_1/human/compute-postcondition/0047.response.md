Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with an additional character '{' appended to it, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary, and `c` is `ord('z') + 1` which is 123.**

In this output state, the list `decoded` has been updated by appending the character '{' which is the result of `chr(c)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
