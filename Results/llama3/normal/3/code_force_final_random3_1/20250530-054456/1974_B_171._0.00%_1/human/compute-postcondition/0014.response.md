Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `c` is the next character in the alphabet after 'a'. If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of the `mapping`, then a new key-value pair is added to `mapping` where the key is 'b' and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`.***
