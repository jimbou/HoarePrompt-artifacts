Output State: **encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list**

The code initializes two empty data structures, a dictionary called `mapping` and a list called `decoded`. The state of the `encoded` variable remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `mapping` dictionary is initialized as empty, meaning it does not contain any key-value pairs. Similarly, the `decoded` list is also initialized as empty, meaning it does not contain any elements.
