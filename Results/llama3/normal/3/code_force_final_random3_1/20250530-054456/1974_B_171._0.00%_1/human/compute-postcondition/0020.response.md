To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `c` in the loop head. The loop will iterate over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means it will iterate over the ASCII values of all lowercase Latin letters.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'a'**
