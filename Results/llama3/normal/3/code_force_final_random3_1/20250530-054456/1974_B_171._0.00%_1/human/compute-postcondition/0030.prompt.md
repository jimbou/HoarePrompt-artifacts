Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'a'. The dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the key 'a' which is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if 'a' is not already a value in the dictionary.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'b'. The dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the key 'a' which is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if 'a' is not already a value in the dictionary. If 'b' is not a value in the dictionary, then the key 'b' is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'c'. The dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the key 'a' which is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if 'a' is not already a value in the dictionary. If 'c' is not a value in the dictionary, then the key 'c' is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded`. Otherwise, the dictionary `mapping` remains unchanged. The variables `encoded`, `decoded`, and `char` retain their original values. The variable `c` still holds the value 'c'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
