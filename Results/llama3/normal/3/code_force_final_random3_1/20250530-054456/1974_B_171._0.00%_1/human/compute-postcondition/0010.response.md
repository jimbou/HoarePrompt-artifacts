Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `mapping[chr(c)]` is `char`, `char` is the first character in the string, and `c` is the next character in the alphabet**

In this code block, the first line assigns the value of `char` to `mapping[chr(c)]`. Since `char` is the first character in the string and `c` is the next character in the alphabet, `mapping[chr(c)]` becomes the first character in the string. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` are not modified by the code, so they retain their initial values. The only change is the assignment of `char` to `mapping[chr(c)]`, which is reflected in the final state.
