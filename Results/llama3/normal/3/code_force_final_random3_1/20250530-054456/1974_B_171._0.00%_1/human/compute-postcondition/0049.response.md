Output State: **`encoded` is an empty string, `decoded` is a list of characters, `char` is not defined, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the corresponding character from the original string `encoded`, and `c` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the input string `encoded` has been fully processed and is now empty. The `decoded` list contains the decoded characters, where each character from the original string `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in the `mapping` dictionary. The `mapping` dictionary has been fully populated with 26 key-value pairs, where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the corresponding character from the original string `encoded`. The variables `char` and `c` are no longer defined, as they were only used within the loop.
