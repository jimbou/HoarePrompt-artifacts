Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `c` is a character between 'a' and 'z'. If the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`.***
