To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`, which means the loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is a character between 'a' and 'z'. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be incremented to the next ASCII value.

Since `c` is a character between 'a' and 'z', the next ASCII value would be the next letter in the alphabet. For example, if `c` is 'a', the next value would be 'b', if `c` is 'b', the next value would be 'c', and so on.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `c` is the next character in the alphabet**.

Note that the states of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head. Only the state of `c` is updated to the next ASCII value.
