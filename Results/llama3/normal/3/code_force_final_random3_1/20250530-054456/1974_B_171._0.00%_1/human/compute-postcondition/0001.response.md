The only variables in the loop head are variables  char and encoded, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `encoded`. If encoded is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `encoded` is not empty and char is the first character in the string.
State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string**
