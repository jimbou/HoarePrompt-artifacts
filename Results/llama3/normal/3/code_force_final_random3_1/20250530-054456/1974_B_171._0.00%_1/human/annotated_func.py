#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

            decoded.append(mapping[char])

    #State: `encoded` is an empty string, `decoded` is a list of characters, `char` is not defined, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the corresponding character from the original string `encoded`, and `c` is not defined.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is a concatenation of all characters in the list 'decoded'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input, creates a mapping of each unique character to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter, and returns a decoded string where each character is replaced by its mapped counterpart. The function effectively performs a character substitution, resulting in a new string where each character is a lowercase Latin letter.
