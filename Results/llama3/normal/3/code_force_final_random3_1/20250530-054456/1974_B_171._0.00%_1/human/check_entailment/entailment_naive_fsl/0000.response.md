Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains duplicate characters. In the problem description, it is mentioned that the string r is constructed by taking all distinct letters of the string s in alphabetical order. However, in the given program, the mapping is created by iterating over the encoded string and assigning the first occurrence of each character to the mapping. This means that if the input string contains duplicate characters, the mapping will not be correct, and the decoding will not work as expected.

For example, if the input string is "aab", the encoded string will be "baa". However, the program will create a mapping where 'a' is mapped to 'b' and 'b' is mapped to 'a', which is incorrect. The correct mapping should be 'a' to 'a' and 'b' to 'b'.
