Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary, and `c` is `ord('z') + 1`. The dictionary `mapping` has been updated such that all keys 'a' to 'z' are mapped to the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the key that is mapped to the third character of the string `encoded`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `encoded` string remains unchanged, the `decoded` list has an additional 'z' character appended to it, the `char` variable still holds the third character of the `encoded` string, and the `mapping` dictionary has been updated such that all keys 'a' to 'z' are mapped to the first character of the `encoded` string, except for one key that is mapped to the third character of the `encoded` string. The variable `c` has reached the end of its range, `ord('z') + 1`.
