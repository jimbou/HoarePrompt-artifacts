Output State: **The loop executes 26 times, and the dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary. The variables `encoded`, `decoded`, and `char` retain their original values. The variable `c` holds the value 'z'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the dictionary `mapping` has been updated to map all lowercase Latin letters to the second character of the string `encoded`, unless they were already mapped to a different value. The other variables remain unchanged.
