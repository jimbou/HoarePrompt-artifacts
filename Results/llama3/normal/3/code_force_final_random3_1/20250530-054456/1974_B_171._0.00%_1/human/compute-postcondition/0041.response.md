Output State: **encoded is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, decoded is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it, char is the third character in the string encoded, mapping is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string encoded, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string encoded if they are not already values in the dictionary, and c is within the range of ord('a') to ord('z') + 1. Additionally, the character represented by the ASCII value c is now a key in the dictionary mapping with the value of the third character of the string encoded.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is the addition of a new key-value pair to the dictionary `mapping`, where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c` and the value is the third character of the string `encoded`. All other variables remain unchanged.
