Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the first character in the string `encoded`. If `char` is a key in the `mapping` dictionary, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the last character of the lowercase Latin alphabet, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'.***
