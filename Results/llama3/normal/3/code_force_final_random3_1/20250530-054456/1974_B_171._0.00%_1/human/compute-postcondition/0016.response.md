Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list containing the last character of the lowercase Latin alphabet, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 'z', and `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`.**

In this output state, the value of `decoded` has been updated to include the last character of the lowercase Latin alphabet, which is 'z', as a result of the execution of the code. The other variables remain unchanged.
