Output State: **The dictionary `mapping` has been updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c` and the value is the third character of the string `encoded`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the dictionary `mapping` has been updated with a new key-value pair. The key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c`, which is within the range of ord('a') to ord('z') + 1.
