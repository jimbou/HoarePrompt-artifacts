Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'. If `char` is in `mapping`, then the first character of the string `encoded` is appended to `decoded`. Otherwise, the loop executes 25 times, and the dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary. The variables `encoded`, and `char` retain their original values. The variable `c` holds the value 'z'. The variable `decoded` has an additional character 'z' appended to it.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary, and `c` is within the range of ord('a') to ord('z') + 1. If the character represented by the ASCII value `c` is not a value in the dictionary `mapping`, then `mapping` has been updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c` and the value is the third character of the string `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary, and `c` is within the range of ord('a') to ord('z') + 1. If the character represented by the ASCII value `c` is not a value in the dictionary `mapping`, then `mapping` has been updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c` and the value is the third character of the string `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary, and `c` is within the range of `ord('a') + 1` to `ord('z') + 1`. If the character represented by the ASCII value `c` is not a value in the dictionary `mapping`, then the key-value pair in `mapping` where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c` has been updated to map to `char`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
