Postcondition: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `c` is the next character in the alphabet. If the character represented by `c` is not a value in the `mapping` dictionary, then `mapping[chr(c)]` is set to `char`.**
