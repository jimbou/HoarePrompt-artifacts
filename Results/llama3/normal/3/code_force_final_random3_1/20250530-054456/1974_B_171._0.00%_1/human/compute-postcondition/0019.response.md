The code appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the list `decoded`. Since `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, and `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, the value of `mapping[char]` is the first character of the string `encoded`.

The value of `decoded` is updated by appending the first character of the string `encoded` to it.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with the first character of the string `encoded` appended to it, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'.**
