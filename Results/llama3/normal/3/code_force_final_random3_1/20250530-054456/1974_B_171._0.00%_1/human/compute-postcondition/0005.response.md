The only variable in the loop head is variable  c, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If c is at least 'a' and at most 'z', the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, encoded is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list, char is the first character in the string, and char is not in mapping does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to c is at least 'a' and at most 'z'.
State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `char` is not in `mapping`, and `c` is at least 'a' and at most 'z'**
