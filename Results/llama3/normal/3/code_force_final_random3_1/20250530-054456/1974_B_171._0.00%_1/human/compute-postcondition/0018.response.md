According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `encoded`. If `encoded` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the first character in the string `encoded`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `encoded` must have at least 2 characters and the `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`.
State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'.**
