The code snippet consists of two lines: `mapping[chr(c)] = char` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the `mapping` dictionary. Since `char` is the first character in the string `encoded` and `c` is a character between 'a' and 'z', this line adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is part of. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, this line does not have any effect on the variables.

Output State: **mapping has a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of c and the value is the first character of the string encoded, encoded is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, decoded is an empty list, char is the first character in the string encoded, and c is a character between 'a' and 'z'.**
