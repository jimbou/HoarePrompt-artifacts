Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `c` is 'b', and the dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the key 'b' which is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded`.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that the value of the key 'b' in the dictionary `mapping` has been updated to the second character of the string `encoded`. All other variables remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not affect any variables, so it does not impact the output state.
