To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `c`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `c` is within the range of `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. Since `c` is currently within this range, we need to increment `c` by 1 for the loop to execute again.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters
* `decoded` is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it
* `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`
* `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary
* `c` is within the range of `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to increment `c` by 1. The other variables are not affected by the loop head.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary, and `c` is within the range of `ord('a') + 1` to `ord('z') + 1`**
