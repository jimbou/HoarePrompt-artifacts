State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary, and `c` is within the range of ord('a') to ord('z') + 1. If the character represented by the ASCII value `c` is not a value in the dictionary `mapping`, then `mapping` has been updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c` and the value is the third character of the string `encoded`.**
