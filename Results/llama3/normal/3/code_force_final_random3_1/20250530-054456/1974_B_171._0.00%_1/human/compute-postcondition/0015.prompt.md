Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `char` is not in `mapping`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `c` is a character between 'a' and 'z'. If the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `c` is the next character in the alphabet. If the character represented by `c` is not a value in the `mapping` dictionary, then `mapping[chr(c)]` is set to `char`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `c` is the next character in the alphabet after 'a'. If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of the `mapping`, then a new key-value pair is added to `mapping` where the key is 'b' and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
