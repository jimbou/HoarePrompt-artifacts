Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the first character in the string `encoded`. If `char` is a key in the `mapping` dictionary, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the last character of the lowercase Latin alphabet, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'. If `char` is in `mapping`, then the first character of the string `encoded` is appended to `decoded`. Otherwise, the loop executes 25 times, and the dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary. The variables `encoded`, and `char` retain their original values. The variable `c` holds the value 'z'. The variable `decoded` has an additional character 'z' appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'. If `char` is in `mapping`, then the first character of the string `encoded` is appended to `decoded`. Otherwise, the loop executes 25 times, and the dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary. The variables `encoded`, and `char` retain their original values. The variable `c` holds the value 'z'. The variable `decoded` has an additional character 'z' appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
