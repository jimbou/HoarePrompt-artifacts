The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c`. If `c` is less than `ord('z') + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is `'a'`, which is equal to `ord('a')`. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be increased by 1.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'b'. The dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the key 'a' which is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if 'a' is not already a value in the dictionary.**
