State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'c'. The dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the key 'a' which is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if 'a' is not already a value in the dictionary. If 'c' is not a value in the dictionary, then the key 'c' is mapped to the second character of the string `encoded`.**
