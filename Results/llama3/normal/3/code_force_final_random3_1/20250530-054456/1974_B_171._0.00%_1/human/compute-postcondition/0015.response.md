Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 'z', and `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `encoded` string remains unchanged, the `decoded` list remains empty, the `char` variable still holds the first character of the string, the loop counter `c` has reached the last lowercase Latin letter 'z', and the `mapping` dictionary now contains 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`.
