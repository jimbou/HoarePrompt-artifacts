Output State: **The dictionary `mapping` has been updated such that the key corresponding to the character 'c' now maps to the second character of the string `encoded`. All other key-value pairs in the dictionary remain unchanged. The variables `encoded`, `decoded`, and `char` retain their original values. The variable `c` still holds the value 'c'.**

In this output state, the dictionary `mapping` has been modified to reflect the new mapping for the key 'c', which now points to the second character of the string `encoded`. The other variables, including `encoded`, `decoded`, and `char`, have not been altered by the code and retain their initial values. The variable `c` also remains unchanged, still holding the value 'c'.
