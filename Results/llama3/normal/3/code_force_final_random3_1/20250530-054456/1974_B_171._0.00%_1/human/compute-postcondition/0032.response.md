Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 2 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, and `c` is 'z'. If `char` is in `mapping`, then the first character of the string `encoded` is appended to `decoded`. Otherwise, the loop executes 25 times, and the dictionary `mapping` has 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary. The variables `encoded`, and `char` retain their original values. The variable `c` holds the value 'z'. The variable `decoded` has an additional character 'z' appended to it.***
