To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `c` and the range defined by `ord('a')` and `ord('z') + 1`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the range has at least one value, which means `ord('a')` must be less than or equal to `ord('z') + 1`. Since `ord('a')` is 97 and `ord('z')` is 122, this condition is always true.

However, we need to consider the initial value of `c`. For the loop to execute, `c` should be within the range defined by `ord('a')` and `ord('z') + 1`. Since `c` is initially 'z', which is equivalent to 122, we need to adjust its value to be within the range.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of at least 3 lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list with an additional character 'z' appended to it, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with 26 key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character of the string `encoded`, except for the keys 'a' to 'z' which are mapped to the second character of the string `encoded` if they are not already values in the dictionary, and `c` is within the range of ord('a') to ord('z') + 1**
