Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string. The current value of the count of x in s is equal to n - 1. If n is odd and the middle character of s (at index (n - 1) // 2) is not equal to x, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either n is even or s[(n - 1) // 2] is equal to x, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and string is printed. We skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables t, i, string, s, and x remain the same, and the stdin still contains t-1 strings s. The condition for printing 'NO' or 'YES', the number 1, and the string also remains the same. The only change is that we move to the next iteration of the loop.
