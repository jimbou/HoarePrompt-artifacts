Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 3, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5. If the character at index j in string s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j and count is less than 1, then count is set to 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If count2 is greater than count, then done is set to True.***
