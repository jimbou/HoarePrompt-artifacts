Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is equal to `j`, `n` is at least 1, `count2` is 0, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), stdin contains `t-3` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` remains False.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated to be equal to `j`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `s[j]`, `x`, and `done` are still valid.
