Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`. 

Here, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length greater than 5, and `j` is 4.

In Python, `string[:j]` means get all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`. Since `j` is 4, this will get the first 4 characters of the string.

`string[j:]` means get all characters from the character at index `j` to the end of the string. Since `j` is 4, this will get all characters from the 5th character to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will print the first 4 characters of the string, followed by the rest of the string (from the 5th character to the end).

Output: **the first 4 characters of the string, followed by the rest of the string (from the 5th character to the end)**
