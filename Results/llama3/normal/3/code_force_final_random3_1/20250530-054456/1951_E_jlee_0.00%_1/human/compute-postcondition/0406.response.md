Output: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 0. The current value of count is greater than 1, which means that there exists an index j in string such that the character at index j is not equal to the first character of string and count was set to j. The first character of string may or may not be equal to the last character of string, and done may or may not be True. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x, meaning the character at index j in string is different from the first character of string. Additionally, either count2 is less than or equal to 0 or count2 is greater than or equal to count. Now, count2 is equal to count, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the string from the beginning to the character before the character at index j is printed, and the string from the character at index j to the end is printed**
