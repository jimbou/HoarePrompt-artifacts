This function reads a series of strings from standard input, where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters. It checks each string to determine if it can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the resulting substrings do not contain a specific character (the first character of the original string) or contain it only once. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES', the number of splits (1 or 2), and the resulting substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple strings as specified by the initial integer input, which represents the number of strings to follow.
