Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, count is 0, count2 is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, then `count` is equal to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1. If `count2` is greater than `count` and not equal to `count`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is increased by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, then no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 3, j is 1. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, done is True if count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, or if count2 is equal to count and count is greater than 1, or if count2 is greater than count. Otherwise, if count2 is not equal to count and count2 is not greater than count, then count is 1, count2 is 1, and done is True if count is greater than 1. If count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0 and done is False. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If count is not greater than 0, then no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 0, i is 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 4, j is 2. If count is greater than 0, then if count2 is greater than count, then count is 2, done is True, and stdin is empty. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True and count is 2. Otherwise, count is either 1 or 2, and done is either True or False. If count2 is less than count, then count is 1. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then t is greater than 0, i is 0, count is 2, done is True, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). If s[j] is not equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. Otherwise, count2 is not changed. If count is 0, then count is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
