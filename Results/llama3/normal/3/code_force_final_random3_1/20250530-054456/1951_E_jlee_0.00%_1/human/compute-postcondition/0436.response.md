Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `count` is 3, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-5 strings s.
