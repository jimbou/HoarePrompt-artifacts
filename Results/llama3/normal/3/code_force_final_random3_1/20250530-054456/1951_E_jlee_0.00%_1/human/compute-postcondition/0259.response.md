The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
