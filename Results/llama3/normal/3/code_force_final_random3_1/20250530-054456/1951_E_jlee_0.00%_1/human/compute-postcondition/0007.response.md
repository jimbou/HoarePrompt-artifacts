Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, if n is 1, 'NO' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made***
