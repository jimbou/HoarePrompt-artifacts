Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `count2` is increased by 1, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and string is printed, and done is set to True, and count is set to 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `i`, `j`, `stdin`, `string`, `s`, `x`, `n`, and the conditional statement regarding `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, and `done`.
