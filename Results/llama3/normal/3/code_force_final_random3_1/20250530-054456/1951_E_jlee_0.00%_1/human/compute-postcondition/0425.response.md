Postcondition: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 0. If s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, stdin is empty, done is True, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. If count is greater than 1, then count2 is equal to count and done is True. If count is equal to 1, then count2 is 0 and done may or may not be True. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. Otherwise, if s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1 and done may or may not be True.**
