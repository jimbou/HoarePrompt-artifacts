Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is at least 1. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, stdin is empty, count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, and done is True. If count2 is 0 or greater than or equal to count, then stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). If count is greater than 1, then count2 is greater than or equal to count and done is True. If count is 1, then count2 is 0 and done is False. If count is greater than 0 and count2 is greater than count, then done is True. Otherwise, the value of done remains unchanged. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is 1, If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False, and s[j] is equal to x. If count is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
