The code prints the first j-1 characters of the string and the rest of the string starting from the j-1 index.
Since j is 3, the first 2 characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string starting from the 2nd index is printed.
Output: **the first 2 characters of the string, the rest of the string starting from the 2nd index**
