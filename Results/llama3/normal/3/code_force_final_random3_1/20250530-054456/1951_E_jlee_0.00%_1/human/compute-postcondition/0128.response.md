Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 3, `j` is 1, `count2` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count2` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `count`, `done`, and the comparison of `s[j]` with `x` and `s[n - 1 - j]` are not affected by this code snippet, so they are still valid.
