Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, which means that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1 before, so `count` is equal to `j`. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`***
