Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 3, string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5. If count2 > 0 and count2 < count, then done is True and count is 3 if the character at index j in string s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j and count is less than 1, otherwise count remains unchanged. Otherwise, if count is greater than 1, then done is True. If count2 is greater than count, then done is set to True. If count2 is equal to count, then count2 is 0. If the character at index j in string s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j and count is less than 1, then count is set to 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
