Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 3, j is 1. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then done is True. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True. Otherwise, if count2 is not equal to count and count2 is not greater than count, then count is 1, count2 is 1, and done is True if count is greater than 1. If count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0 and done is False.**
