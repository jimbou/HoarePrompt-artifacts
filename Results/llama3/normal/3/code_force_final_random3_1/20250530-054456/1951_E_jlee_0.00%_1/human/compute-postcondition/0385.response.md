Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 0, j is 0, count is 0, count2 is 0. The current value of the first character of string is not equal to the character at index j of string and the current value of count is less than 1. If the first character of string is not equal to the last character of string, then done is True. Otherwise, no change in the values of the variables.***
