Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 0, count is greater than 0, if count2 is greater than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
