Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, count is either 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 4, j is 2. If count is greater than 1, then done is True and count is 2. Otherwise, count is either 1 or 2, and done is either True or False.***
