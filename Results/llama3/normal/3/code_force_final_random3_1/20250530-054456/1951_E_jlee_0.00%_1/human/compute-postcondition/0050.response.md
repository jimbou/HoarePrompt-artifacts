Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is equal to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated to be equal to `j`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `s[j]`, `x`, and `done` are still valid.
