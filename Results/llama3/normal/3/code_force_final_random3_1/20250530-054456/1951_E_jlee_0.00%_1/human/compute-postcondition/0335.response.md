Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 5, j is 3. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then done is True, and the output contains 'YES', 2, the first three characters of the string, and the rest of the string (from the 4th character to the end). If count2 is not greater than 0 or not less than count, then done is True if count is greater than 1, or if count is less than or equal to 1 and s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], or if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 3. If none of the above conditions are met, then count2 is 0 if count2 is equal to count, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
