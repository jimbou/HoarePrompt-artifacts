Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, `j` is (n + 1) // 2, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False. If the first character of `string` is not equal to the last character of `string`, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, the string is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If the first character of `string` is equal to the last character of `string` and `s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`, then we skip the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
