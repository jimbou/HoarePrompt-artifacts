Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is either 1 or 2, `count2` is increased by 1, stdin contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `count2` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings `s`, and the properties of `string`, `s`, `x`, `n`, and `j` are still valid. The value of `count` is still either 1 or 2, as it was not affected by the code.
