Output: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, count is either 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 4, j is 2. If the character at index j in string s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in string s and count is less than 1, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, the string is printed, and done is set to True, and count is set to 2. Otherwise, count is set to 1. 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first j-1 characters of the string are printed, and the characters of the string starting from the jth character to the end are printed**
