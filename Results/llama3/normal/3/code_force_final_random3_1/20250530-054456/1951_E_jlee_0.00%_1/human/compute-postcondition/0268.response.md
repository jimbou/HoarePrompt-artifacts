Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and the string is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions and prints specified in the initial state are still applicable.
