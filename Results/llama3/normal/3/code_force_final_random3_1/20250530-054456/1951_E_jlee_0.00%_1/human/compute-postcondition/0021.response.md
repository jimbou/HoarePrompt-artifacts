Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`. The current value of `s` contains the first character `x`, `n` times, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0, `i` is still 0, and the stdin still contains `t-1` strings `s`. The `string` and its corresponding list of characters `s` and the first character `x` also remain unchanged. The current value of `s` still contains the first character `x`, `n` times, and 'NO' is still being printed. However, the execution skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
