Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string. The current value of x is not equal to the last character of s, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and the string which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6) is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, i, stdin, string, s, and x remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the continue statement. The print statements 'YES', 1, and string are still being printed as they were in the initial state.
