Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 0. If the character at index j of string is not equal to the first character of string and count is less than 1, then count is set to j. If the first character of string is not equal to the last character of string, then done is True. Otherwise, no change in the values of the variables.***
