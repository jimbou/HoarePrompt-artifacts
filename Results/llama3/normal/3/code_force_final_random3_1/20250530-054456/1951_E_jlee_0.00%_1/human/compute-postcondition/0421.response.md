Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 0. If count is greater than 1, then count2 is equal to count and done is True. If count is equal to 1, then count2 is 0 and done may or may not be True. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
