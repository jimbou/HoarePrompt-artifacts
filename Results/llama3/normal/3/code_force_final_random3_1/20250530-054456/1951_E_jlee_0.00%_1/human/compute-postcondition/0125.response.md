Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 3, j is 1. If count2 is greater than count, then count is 1, count2 is 1, and done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
