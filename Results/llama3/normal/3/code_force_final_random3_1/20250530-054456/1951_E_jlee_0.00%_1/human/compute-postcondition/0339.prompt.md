Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is 0, count2 is 0, done is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is at least 1. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, stdin is empty, count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, and done is True. If count2 is 0 or greater than or equal to count, then stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). If count is greater than 1, then count2 is greater than or equal to count and done is True. If count is 1, then count2 is 0 and done is False. If count is greater than 0 and count2 is greater than count, then done is True. Otherwise, the value of done remains unchanged. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is 1, If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False, and s[j] is equal to x. If count is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 1, j is 2. If count is greater than 0, then the following conditions are met: If s[j] is not equal to x, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, the number 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and the string is being printed. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then done is True. If count is greater than 1 or count2 is greater than or equal to count, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, the number 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 5, j is 3. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, done is True if count is greater than 1, or if count is less than or equal to 1 and s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], or if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 3. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then done is True, and the output contains 'YES', 2, the first three characters of the string, and the rest of the string (from the 4th character to the end). If count2 is not greater than 0 or not less than count, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If count is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
