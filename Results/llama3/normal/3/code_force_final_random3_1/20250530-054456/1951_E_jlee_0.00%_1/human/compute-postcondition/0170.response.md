Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 4, j is 2. If count is greater than 0, then if count2 is greater than count, then count is 2, done is True, and stdin is empty. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True and count is 2. Otherwise, count is either 1 or 2, and done is either True or False. If count2 is less than count, then count is 1. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then t is greater than 0, i is 0, count is 2, done is True, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). If s[j] is not equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. Otherwise, count2 is not changed. If count is 0, then count is set to 1. ***
