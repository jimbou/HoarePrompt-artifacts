Output: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 5, j is 3. If count is greater than 0, then the following conditions are met: If s[j] is not equal to x, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, the number 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and the string is being printed. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then done is True. If count is greater than 1 or count2 is greater than or equal to count, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, the number 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. and 'YES' is being printed**
