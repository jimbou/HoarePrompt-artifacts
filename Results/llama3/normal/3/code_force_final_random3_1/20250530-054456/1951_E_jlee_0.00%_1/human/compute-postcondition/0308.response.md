Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 5, j is 3, count is 3. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains greater than 1, i remains 1, the stdin still contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6, the string remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6, s remains a list of characters in string, x remains the first character of string, n remains greater than 5, j remains 3, and count is assigned the value of j which is 3. The condition for done remains the same, if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
