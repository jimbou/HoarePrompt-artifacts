Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count2` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input `stdin` still contains `t-1` strings, and the string and list variables maintain their original properties. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` are unchanged, and `count` remains equal to `j`.
