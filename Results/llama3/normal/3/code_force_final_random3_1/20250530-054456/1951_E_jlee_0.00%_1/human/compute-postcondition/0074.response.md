Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is equal to `count`, and `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `count` is greater than 0 and equal to `j`, and `count2` is 0.**
