Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string. The current value of the count of x in s is equal to n - 1. If n is odd and the middle character of s (at index (n - 1) // 2) is not equal to x, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either n is even or s[(n - 1) // 2] is equal to x, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and string is printed.***
