Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input string is "abba", the program will print "NO", but the correct answer is "YES" because the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings: "ab" and "ba".

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the first and last characters of the string are different, or if the string contains a character that is not the same as the first character. However, it does not consider all possible partitions of the string. In the case of "abba", the program does not consider the partition "ab" and "ba", which are both non-palindromic.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible partitions of the string and check if each partition is non-palindromic.
