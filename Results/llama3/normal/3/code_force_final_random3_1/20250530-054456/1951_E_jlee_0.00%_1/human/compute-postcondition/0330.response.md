Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`. Here, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and `j` is an integer with a value of 3.

The expression `string[:j]` will return a substring of `string` from the beginning to the index `j` (exclusive). Since `j` is 3, this will return the first 3 characters of `string`.

The expression `string[j:]` will return a substring of `string` from the index `j` to the end. Since `j` is 3, this will return all characters of `string` starting from the 4th character (index 3) to the end.

Therefore, the print statement will print the first 3 characters of `string` followed by the rest of the characters of `string` starting from the 4th character.

Output: **the first 3 characters of string, the rest of the characters of string starting from the 4th character**
