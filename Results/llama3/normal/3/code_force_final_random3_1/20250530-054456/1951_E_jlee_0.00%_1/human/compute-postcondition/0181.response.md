Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is either 0 or 1 or 2, count2 is either 0 or 1 or 2, done is False. If the length of the string is 1, 'NO' is printed and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration.***
