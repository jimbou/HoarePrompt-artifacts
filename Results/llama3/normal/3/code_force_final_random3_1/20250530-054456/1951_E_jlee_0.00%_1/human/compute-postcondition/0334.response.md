Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 5, j is 3. If count is greater than 1, then done is True. If count is less than or equal to 1, then done is True if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], otherwise done remains unchanged. Additionally, if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 3. If count2 is equal to count, then count2 is 0 if none of the above conditions are met. If count2 is not equal to count, then done is True if count2 is greater than count, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
