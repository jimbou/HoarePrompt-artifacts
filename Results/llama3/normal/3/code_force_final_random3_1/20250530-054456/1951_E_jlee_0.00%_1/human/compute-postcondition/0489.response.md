The code prints the string `string` split into two parts at index `j - 1`. Since `j` is 4, the split occurs at index 3. The first part, `string[:j - 1]`, includes all characters up to but not including the 4th character. The second part, `string[j - 1:]`, includes the 4th character and all characters after it.

Output: **string[:3], string[3:] (where string is the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters)**
