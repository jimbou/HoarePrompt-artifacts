Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is either 0 or 1 or 2, count2 is either 0 or 1 or 2, done is False.**

Explanation:
The first line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `string`. Since stdin contains `t-2` strings, after reading one string, it now contains `t-3` strings. The second line converts the string into a list of characters and assigns it to `s`. The third line calculates the length of the string and assigns it to `n`. The fourth line sets `done` to False. The values of `t`, `i`, `x`, `j`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged.
