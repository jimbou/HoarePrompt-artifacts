Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 1, j is 2. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then done is True. If count is greater than 1 or count2 is greater than or equal to count, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, the number 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
