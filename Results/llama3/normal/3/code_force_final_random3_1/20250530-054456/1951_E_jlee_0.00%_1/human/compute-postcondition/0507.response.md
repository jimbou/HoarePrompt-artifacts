Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than or equal to 0, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is either 0 or n // 2, count2 is either 0 or n // 2, done is True.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and the variable "done" is set to True. The value of "j" is now equal to the integer division of the length of the string "n" by 2, plus 1 divided by 2. The value of "count" is either 0 or the integer division of the length of the string "n" by 2. The value of "count2" is either 0 or the integer division of the length of the string "n" by 2. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
