Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is either 0 or 1 or 2, count2 is either 0 or 1 or 2, done is False, 'YES' is being printed, and 1 is being printed, and the string is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, and the only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
