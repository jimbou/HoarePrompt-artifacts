Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is 0, count2 is 0, done is False.**

The code block reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `string`. This string consists of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is between 1 and 10^6. The variable `s` is then assigned a list of characters in `string`. The length of `s` (and `string`) is assigned to the variable `n`. The variable `done` is set to `False`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
