Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, `j` is (n + 1) // 2, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False. If the length of `string` is odd and the middle character of `string` is not equal to the first character of `string`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed.**
