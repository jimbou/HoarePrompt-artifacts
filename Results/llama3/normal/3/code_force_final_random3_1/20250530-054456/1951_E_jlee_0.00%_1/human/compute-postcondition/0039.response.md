To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because `(n + 1) // 2` will be at least 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0**
