Based on the precondition, the code will print the number 1.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The precondition states that 'YES' is printed, but this is not relevant to the print statement in question.
* The print statement is simply `print(1)`, which means it will print the number 1.
* There are no variables or objects involved in this print statement, so there's no need to consider their values.

Output: **1**
