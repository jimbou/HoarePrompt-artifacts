The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6)**
