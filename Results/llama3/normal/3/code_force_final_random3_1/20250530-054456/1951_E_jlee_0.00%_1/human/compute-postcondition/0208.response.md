Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`.***
