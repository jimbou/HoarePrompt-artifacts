Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is at least 1, count is greater than 0, count2 is 1, If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False, and s[j] is equal to x.**

In this output state, the value of count2 has been incremented by 1, resulting in count2 being equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
