Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 5, j is 3, count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 3. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count2 is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for count and done are still valid, meaning that if the character at index j in string s is not equal to the first character x and count is less than 1, then count is 3. Also, if the character at index j in string s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in string s, then done is True.
