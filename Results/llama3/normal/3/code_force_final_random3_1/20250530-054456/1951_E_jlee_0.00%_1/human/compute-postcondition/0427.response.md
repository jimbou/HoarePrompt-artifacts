The only variable in the loop head is variable j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than (n+1)//2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, n is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again j is increased by 1 so j is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 5.
State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5, j is 3**
