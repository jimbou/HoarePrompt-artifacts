Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 4, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and string is printed, and done is set to True, and count is set to 4. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first 4 characters of the string which are string[:4] and the rest of the string which is string[4:] are printed, and done is set to True. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first j-1 characters of the string which is string[:j - 1] and the rest of the string which is string[j - 1:] are printed, and done is True. If count2 is equal to count and count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0, done is either True or False, and count is either 1 or 4. If count2 is not equal to count and count2 is not greater than 0 and less than count, then 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first 4 characters of the string which are string[:4] and the rest of the string which is string[4:] are printed, and done is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
