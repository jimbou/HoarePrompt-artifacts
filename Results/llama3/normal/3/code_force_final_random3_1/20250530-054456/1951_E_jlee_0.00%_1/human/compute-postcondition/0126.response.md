Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 3, j is 1. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, count is 1, count2 is 1, and done is True. If count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0 and done is False. If count2 is not equal to count, then if count2 is greater than count, count is 1, count2 is 1, and done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
