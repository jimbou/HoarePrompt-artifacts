Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string. If the first character of string is not equal to the last character of s, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
