Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 0. If count is greater than 1, then count2 is equal to count and done is True. If count is equal to 1, then count2 is 0 and done may or may not be True.***
