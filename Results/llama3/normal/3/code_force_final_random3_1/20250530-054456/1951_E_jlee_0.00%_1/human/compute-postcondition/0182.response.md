Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is either 0 or 1 or 2, count2 is either 0 or 1 or 2, done is False.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of x is now the first character of the string. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains t-3 strings s.
