State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` is greater than 5, `j` is (`n + 1`) // 2, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0. If `done` is `False`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
