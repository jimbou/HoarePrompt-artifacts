Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 4, j is 2. If count2 is greater than count, then count is 2, done is True, and stdin is empty. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True and count is 2. Otherwise, count is either 1 or 2, and done is either True or False. If count2 is less than count, then count is 1.***
