Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is 0, count2 is 0, done is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 0. If count > 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, stdin is empty, done is True, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. If count is greater than 1, then count2 is equal to count and done is True. If count is equal to 1, then count2 is 0 and done may or may not be True. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. Otherwise, if s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1 and done may or may not be True. If count is not greater than 0, then no change in the values of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 3, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5. If the character at index j in string s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j and count is less than 1, then count is set to 3. If count is greater than 0, then done is True if count2 is greater than 0 and count2 is less than count, or if count is greater than 1, or if count2 is greater than count. If count2 is equal to count, then count2 is 0. If s[j] is not equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 4, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and string is printed, and done is set to True, and count is set to 4. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first 4 characters of the string which are string[:4] and the rest of the string which is string[4:] are printed, and done is set to True. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first j-1 characters of the string which is string[:j - 1] and the rest of the string which is string[j - 1:] are printed, and done is True. If count2 is equal to count and count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0, done is either True or False, and count is either 1 or 4. If count2 is not equal to count and count2 is not greater than 0 and less than count, then 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first 4 characters of the string which are string[:4] and the rest of the string which is string[4:] are printed, and done is set to True. If count is not greater than 0, then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
