Output: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 1, j is 2. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 2. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and the string is being printed, and 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is being printed**
