Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `count` is equal to `j`. If `count2` is greater than `count` and not equal to `count`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
