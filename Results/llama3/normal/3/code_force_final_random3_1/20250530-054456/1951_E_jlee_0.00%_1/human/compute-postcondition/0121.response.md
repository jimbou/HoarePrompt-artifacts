Output: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 3, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1. If `count2` is greater than `count` and not equal to `count`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables, and 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed**
