Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is at least 1. Initially, count was either 0 or equal to j, but the current value of count is greater than 0. count2 is either 0 or greater than or equal to count. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x.***
