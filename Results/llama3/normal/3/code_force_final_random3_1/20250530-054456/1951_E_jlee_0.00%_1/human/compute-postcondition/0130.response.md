Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n must be at least 3, j is 1. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, done is True if count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, or if count2 is equal to count and count is greater than 1, or if count2 is greater than count. Otherwise, if count2 is not equal to count and count2 is not greater than count, then count is 1, count2 is 1, and done is True if count is greater than 1. If count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0 and done is False. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If count is not greater than 0, then no changes are made to the variables.**
