Output: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is greater than 5, j is 3. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 3. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first 3 characters of the string which are string[:j] and the rest of the string which is string[j:] are printed**
