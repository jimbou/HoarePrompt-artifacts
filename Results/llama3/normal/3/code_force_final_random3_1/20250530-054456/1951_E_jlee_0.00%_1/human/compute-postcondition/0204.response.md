Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string, j is (n + 1) // 2, count is either 0 or 1 or 2, count2 is either 0 or 1 or 2, done is False. If the first character of the string is equal to all but one character of the string, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
