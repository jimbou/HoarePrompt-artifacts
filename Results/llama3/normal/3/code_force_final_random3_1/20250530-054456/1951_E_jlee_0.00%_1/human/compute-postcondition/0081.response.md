The code prints two parts of the string `string`. The first part is from the beginning of the string to the index `j` (exclusive), and the second part is from the index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `j` is 0, the first part of the string is empty. The second part of the string is the entire string `string` starting from the first character.

Output: **[empty string], [the entire string string]**
