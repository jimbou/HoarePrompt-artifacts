The code snippet is a simple continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next one.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is 1, `done` is False, and 'NO' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration due to the continue statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the same input strings. The only difference is that we move on to the next iteration, skipping the rest of the current one.
