Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 4, stdin contains t-5 strings s, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in string, x is the first character of string, n is the length of string and must be greater than 5. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and string is printed, and done is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
