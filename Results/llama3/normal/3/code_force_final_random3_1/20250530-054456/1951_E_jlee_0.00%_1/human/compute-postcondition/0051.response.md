Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s`, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True.***
