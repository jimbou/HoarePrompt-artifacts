Output State: **arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1, ans is a list of n integers all equal to 10^9, and i is n - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The code creates a new list `ans` with `n` elements, all initialized to `10^9`. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n - 2`.
