#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1, and 2 <= n <= 500.
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: ans is a list of n integers where ans[i] is equal to ans[i + 1] - arr[i] for all i from 0 to n - 2, and the rest are equal to 10^9, and i is -1
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of n integers where each element at index i (from 0 to n-2) is equal to the difference between the next element and the corresponding element in the array 'arr', and the rest of the elements are equal to 10^9, and the index 'i' is -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'n' as input, where 'n' is equal to the length of 'arr' plus one. It returns a list of 'n' integers, where each element at index 'i' (from 0 to 'n-2') is calculated as the difference between the next element and the corresponding element in 'arr', and the remaining elements are set to 10^9. The function does not modify the input list 'arr'.
