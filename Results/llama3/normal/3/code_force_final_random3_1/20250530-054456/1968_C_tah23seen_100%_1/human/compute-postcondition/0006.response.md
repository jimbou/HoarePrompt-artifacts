Output State: **arr has at least one element, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and n is greater than or equal to 4, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n-2] is equal to ans[n-1] - arr[n-2], ans[n-3] is equal to ans[n-2] - arr[n-3], ans[i] is equal to ans[i + 1] - arr[i], and the rest are equal to 10^9, and i is greater than or equal to -1**

The code modifies the value of `ans[i]` by assigning it the difference between `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. This change affects the value of `ans[i]`, making it dependent on the values of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it greater than or equal to -1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
