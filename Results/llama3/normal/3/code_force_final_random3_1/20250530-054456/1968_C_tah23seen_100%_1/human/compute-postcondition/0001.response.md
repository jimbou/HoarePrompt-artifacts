To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to examine the condition in the while loop head, which is `i >= 0`.

Given that `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is an integer such that `n = len(arr) + 1`, we need to determine the conditions under which `i` will be greater than or equal to 0.

Since `i = n - 2`, for `i` to be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. Given that `n = len(arr) + 1`, for `n` to be greater than or equal to 2, `len(arr)` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state of `arr` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it has at least one element.

State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `n` is an integer such that `n = len(arr) + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` integers all equal to 10^9, and `i` is `n - 2`**
