Functionality: This function takes a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'n' as input, where 'n' is equal to the length of 'arr' plus one. It returns a list of 'n' integers, where each element at index 'i' (from 0 to 'n-2') is calculated as the difference between the next element and the corresponding element in 'arr', and the remaining elements are set to 10^9. The function does not modify the input list 'arr'.
