Functionality: This function generates a list of integers where each element at index i (from 0 to n-2) is the difference between the next element and the corresponding element in the input array 'arr', and the rest of the elements are set to 10^9. The function takes an array of integers and its length plus one as input, and returns the generated list of integers.
