Output State: **arr has at least one element, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and n is greater than or equal to 3, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n-2] is equal to ans[n-1] - arr[n-2], ans[n-3] is equal to ans[n-2] - arr[n-3], and the rest are equal to 10^9, and i is n - 4**

The code modifies the value of `ans[i]` by assigning it the difference between `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. Since `i` is initially `n - 3`, this operation updates the value of `ans[n - 3]`. The second line decrements `i` by 1, making it `n - 4`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
