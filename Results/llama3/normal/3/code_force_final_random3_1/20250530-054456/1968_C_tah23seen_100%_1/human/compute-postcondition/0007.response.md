Output State: **ans is a list of n integers where ans[i] is equal to ans[i + 1] - arr[i] for all i from 0 to n - 2, and the rest are equal to 10^9, and i is -1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list "ans" will have its elements from index 0 to n-2 updated to be the difference between the next element in the list and the corresponding element in the list "arr". The rest of the elements in the list "ans" will remain equal to 10^9. The variable "i" will be -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
