The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i.  If i is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is n - 4 and n is greater than or equal to 3, So for the loop to be executed one more time n needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and i currently must be greater or equal to 0.
State: **arr has at least one element, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and n is greater than or equal to 4, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n-2] is equal to ans[n-1] - arr[n-2], ans[n-3] is equal to ans[n-2] - arr[n-3], and the rest are equal to 10^9, and i is greater than or equal to 0**
