Output State: **arr has at least one element, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n-2] is equal to ans[n-1] - arr[n-2] and the rest are equal to 10^9, and i is n - 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans[n-2]` has been updated to be equal to `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, and the value of `i` has been decremented by 1. The rest of the elements in `ans` remain unchanged, and the values of `arr` and `n` are not affected by the code.
