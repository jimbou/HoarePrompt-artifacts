Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables.
2. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the values of `ans` based on the given conditions. It starts from the end of the array and calculates each `ans[i]` as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which satisfies the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`.
3. The function returns the correct list of `n` integers, where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n-2`) is equal to the difference between the next element and the corresponding element in the array `arr`, and the rest of the elements are equal to `10^9`.
4. The program correctly prints the output for each test case.

The key insight here is that the program uses a clever trick to satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`. By calculating each `ans[i]` as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, it ensures that `ans[i]` is always greater than `arr[i]`, which is a necessary condition for the modulo operation to work correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
