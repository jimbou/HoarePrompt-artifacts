Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program outputs:

999999999 999999997 999999999 999999998

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Specifically, 4 ≠ 999999997 mod 999999999.

The issue with the program is that it simply subtracts the current element from the next element in the array to calculate the previous element, without considering the modulo operation. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

A correct solution would need to take into account the modulo operation and find a way to construct the array a_1, ..., a_n that satisfies the condition.
