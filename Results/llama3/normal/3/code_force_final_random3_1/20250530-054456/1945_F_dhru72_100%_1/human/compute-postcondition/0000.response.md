Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), the second line contains a list of n integers (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9), and the third line contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, T is a TypeVar variable.**

The code defines a TypeVar variable T, which is a generic type variable in Python. This variable is not assigned any specific value, but rather serves as a placeholder for a type that will be specified later. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines: the first line contains an integer n, the second line contains a list of n integers, and the third line contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
