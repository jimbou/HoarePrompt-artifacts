Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of at least 2 integers, num is the first integer in ar if ar[i] is equal to num, otherwise num is the second integer in ar, minn is positive infinity if ar[i] is equal to num, otherwise minn is 1, i is 1 if ar[i] is equal to num, otherwise i is 2, and same is 2 if ar[i] is equal to num, otherwise same is 1.***
