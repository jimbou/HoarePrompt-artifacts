Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, ar is a list of n integers, if the current value of ar[i] is equal to num, then same is 2, num is the first integer in ar, minn is infinite, i is 1, and stdin contains t-5 test cases. Otherwise, same is 1, num is the second integer in ar, minn is 1, i is 2, and stdin contains t-5 test cases.***
