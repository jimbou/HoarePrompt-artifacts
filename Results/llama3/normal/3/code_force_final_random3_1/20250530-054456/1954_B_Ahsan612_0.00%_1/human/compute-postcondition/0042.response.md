Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`. Otherwise, if `same` is 1, then `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `i` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is the integer at index `i+2` in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `same`, `num`, and `i` are still valid, but the value of `i` has been updated. The input stream still contains `t-3` test cases.
