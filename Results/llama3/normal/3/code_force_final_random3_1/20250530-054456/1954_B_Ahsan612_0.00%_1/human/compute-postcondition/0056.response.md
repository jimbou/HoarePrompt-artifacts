Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `same` is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to `n`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `minn` is infinite, -1 is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar` or the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar` which is `minn` is being printed.***
