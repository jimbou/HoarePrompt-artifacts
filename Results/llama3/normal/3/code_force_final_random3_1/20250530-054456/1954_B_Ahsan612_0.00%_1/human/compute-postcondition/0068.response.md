Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, ar is a list of n integers, num is the third integer in ar if the first and second integers in ar are equal, otherwise num is the third integer in ar, minn is 1, same is 1, i is 3, and stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 3. Then, it assigns the value of the third integer in `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (which is either infinite or 1) and the value of `same` (which is either 2 or 1). Since `minn` is either infinite or 1, and `same` is either 2 or 1, the minimum value will always be 1, making `minn` equal to 1. Finally, the value of `same` is set to 1. The value of `n`, `ar`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
