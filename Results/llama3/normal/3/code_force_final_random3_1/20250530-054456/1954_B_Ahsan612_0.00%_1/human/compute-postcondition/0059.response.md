The only variable in the loop head is variable i and ar, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ar` is a list of n integers. `n` being an integer greater than or equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is infinite, i is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**
