Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, if the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinite, `i` is 2, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now 3, and the other variables remain the same. Otherwise, `same` is now 2, and the other variables remain the same. The values of `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, `i`, and stdin are unchanged.
