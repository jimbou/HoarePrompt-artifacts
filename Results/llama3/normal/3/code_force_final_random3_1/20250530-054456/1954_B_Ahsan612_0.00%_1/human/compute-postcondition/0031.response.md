To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `i < len(ar)`. This means we need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `len(ar)` (which is equivalent to `n` since `n` is the number of integers in `ar`).

1. **Adjusting `i`**: Right before the loop, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is already 1, it satisfies the condition as long as `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

2. **Adjusting `len(ar)` (or `n`)**: Right before the loop, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in `ar`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `i` is 1. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, as the conditions for `same`, `num`, `minn`, and the contents of `stdin` do not affect the loop's ability to execute its first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**
