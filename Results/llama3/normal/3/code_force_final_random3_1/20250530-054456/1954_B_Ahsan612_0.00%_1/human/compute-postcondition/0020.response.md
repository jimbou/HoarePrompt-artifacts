Output State: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of n integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of all sequences of equal integers in `ar`, and `i` is n.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has traversed the entire list of integers `ar` and has found the minimum length of all sequences of equal integers in `ar`. The variable `same` has been reset to 1, indicating that the loop has started a new sequence of equal integers. The variable `num` now holds the last integer in `ar`, and the variable `minn` holds the minimum length of all sequences of equal integers in `ar`. The variable `i` has reached the end of the list `ar`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
