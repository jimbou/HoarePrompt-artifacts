Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, ar is a list of n integers, minn is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in ar, same is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in ar, num is the last integer in ar, i is equal to n, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire list of integers `ar` and has found the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list, which is stored in `minn`. The number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in the list is stored in `same`, and the last integer itself is stored in `num`. The loop counter `i` has reached the end of the list, and the number of test cases remaining in `stdin` is still `t-3`.
