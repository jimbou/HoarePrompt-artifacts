Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is infinite, i is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, if the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinite, `i` is 2, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinite, and `i` is 3, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and the first and second integers in `ar` are equal, then `num` is the third integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, and `i` is 4, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and the first and second integers in `ar` are not equal, then `same` is 2, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `i` is 4, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers and the length of `ar` must be greater than 4. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, 3 or 4, `minn` is 1 or infinite, and `i` is 4 or 5, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the (i+1)th integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, 2 or 3, `i` is 5 or 6, and stdin contains `t-6` test cases.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
