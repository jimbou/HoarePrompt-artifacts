Based on the precondition, the code `print(-1)` will print the integer -1.

Here's the explanation:

* The precondition states that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The precondition also states that `ar` is a list of `n` integers, but again, this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The precondition mentions `minn`, `same`, `num`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the print statement.
* The precondition mentions that stdin contains `t-3` test cases, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement simply prints the integer -1, without any reference to the variables or objects mentioned in the precondition.

Output: **-1**
