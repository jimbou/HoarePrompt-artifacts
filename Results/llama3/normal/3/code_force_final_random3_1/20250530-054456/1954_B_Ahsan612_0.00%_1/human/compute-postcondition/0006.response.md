Output State: **n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of at least 2 integers, same is 1, num is the second integer in ar, minn is 1, i is 2, and stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code increments `i` by 1, making it 2. It then assigns the second integer in `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (positive infinity) and `same` (1), resulting in `minn` becoming 1. Finally, `same` is reset to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
