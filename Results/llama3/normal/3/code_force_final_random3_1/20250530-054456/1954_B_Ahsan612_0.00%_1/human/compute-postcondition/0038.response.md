The variable in the loop head is `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i+2` and `ar` is a list of `n` integers. `i` being `i+2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n-1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i+2` in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`.**
