Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been reduced by 1 because one test case has been processed. The value of `n` is now the number of integers in the next test case. The list `ar` contains the `n` integers from the next test case. The variable `same` has been initialized to 1, and `num` has been set to the first integer in `ar`. The variable `minn` has been initialized to positive infinity, and `i` has been set to 1.
