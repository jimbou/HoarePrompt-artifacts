The only variable in the loop head is variable i and ar, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and ar.  If i is less than len(ar), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is increased by 1 and i is less than n-1 or i is less than n. So for the loop to be executed one more time, i must be less than n-1 and len(ar) must be greater than n-1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers and len(ar) must be greater than n-1, `minn` is 1, `i` is increased by 1 and i must be less than n-1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`. Otherwise, if `same` is 1, then `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `i` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is the integer at index `i+2` in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`.**
