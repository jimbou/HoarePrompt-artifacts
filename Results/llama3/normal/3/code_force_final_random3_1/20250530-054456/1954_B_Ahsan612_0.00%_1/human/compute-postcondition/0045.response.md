Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, ar is a list of n integers and len(ar) must be greater than n-1, minn is 1, i is increased by 1 and i must be less than n, num is the integer at index i in ar, same is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `ar` also remains the same, with its length still being greater than `n-1`. The variable `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its original value (1) and the value of `same`, which is initially 1, 2, or 3. However, since `same` is reassigned to 1 in the last line of the code, `minn` will remain 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but it is still less than `n`. The variable `num` is assigned the value of the integer at index `i` in `ar`, and `same` is set to 1. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-3`.
