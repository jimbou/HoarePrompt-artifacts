Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers and the length of ar must be greater than 4, `same` is 2, 3 or 4, `num` is the first, second or third integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1 or infinite, and `i` is 3 or 4, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 2, 3, or 4. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-5` test cases.
