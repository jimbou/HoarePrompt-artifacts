Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the last integer in ar, minn is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in ar, i is n, and stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be as follows:

* `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1.
* `ar` remains a list of `n` integers.
* `same` is reset to 1, indicating that the last integer in `ar` is the only one in its consecutive sequence.
* `num` is updated to the last integer in `ar`.
* `minn` is updated to the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `ar`, which is the minimum value of `same` throughout the loop iterations.
* `i` is updated to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements in `ar`.
* `stdin` still contains `t-5` test cases, as the loop does not affect the input stream.

Note that the output state only changes the values of the variables affected by the loop head and body, while keeping the state of other variables unchanged.
