Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers and the length of `ar` must be greater than 4. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, 3 or 4, `minn` is 1 or infinite, and `i` is 4 or 5, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the (i+1)th integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, 2 or 3, `i` is 5 or 6, and stdin contains `t-6` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num` before the increment, then `i` is now 4 or 5. Otherwise, `i` is now 5 or 6. The values of `n`, `ar`, `same`, `minn`, and `num` remain the same, and the number of test cases in stdin has not changed.
