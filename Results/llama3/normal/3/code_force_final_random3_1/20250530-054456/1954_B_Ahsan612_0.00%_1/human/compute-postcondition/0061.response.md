The code increments the value of `same` by 1. The initial value of `same` is 1, so the new value of `same` is 2. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinite, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**
