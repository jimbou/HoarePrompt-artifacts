Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 4 integers. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 4, and `same` is 4. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 5, and `same` is 3. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `num` is the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is the minimum of 1 and 2, `i` is 5 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 6, and `same` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `num`, `minn`, and `same` are still dependent on the value of `ar[i]`.
