Postcondition: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 3 integers if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `ar` is a list of at least 4 integers, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `i` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 3, and `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2.**
