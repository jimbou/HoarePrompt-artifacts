Output State: **n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of at least 3 integers if ar[i] is equal to num, otherwise ar is a list of at least 4 integers, num is the integer at index i in ar, minn is 1, i is 3 if ar[i] is equal to num, otherwise i is 4, same is 1, and stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `ar` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `num` is updated to the integer at index `i` in `ar`. The value of `minn` is updated to 1, as it is assigned the minimum value between its current value (positive infinity or 1) and `same` (2 or 1). The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise it becomes 4. The value of `same` is reset to 1. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
