Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `n`, and stdin contains 0 test cases. If `minn` is infinite, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original `minn` and 1 is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the number of integers in the last test case, `ar` will be the list of integers in the last test case, `same` will be 1 (since the loop starts with `same` set to 1), `num` will be the last integer in the last test case, and `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop iterates over all integers in the test case). Additionally, stdin will contain 0 test cases, since all test cases will have been processed. The value of `minn` will be the minimum of the original `minn` and 1, and if `minn` is infinite, -1 will be printed; otherwise, the minimum of the original `minn` and 1 will be printed.
