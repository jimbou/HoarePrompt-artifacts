Output State: **n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of at least 4 integers, num is the integer in ar at index i+1, minn is the minimum of positive infinity and 3 if ar[i] is equal to num, otherwise minn is the minimum of 1 and 2, i is 4 if ar[i] is equal to num, otherwise i is 5, same is 1, and stdin contains t-1 test cases**
