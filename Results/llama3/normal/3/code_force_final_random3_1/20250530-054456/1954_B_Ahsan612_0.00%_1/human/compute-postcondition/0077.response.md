Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the original `minn` and 1, `i` is `n`, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and 1. This means that if the original `minn` was greater than 1, it will now be 1, and if it was already 1 or less, it will remain unchanged. The other variables and the stdin remain unaffected.
