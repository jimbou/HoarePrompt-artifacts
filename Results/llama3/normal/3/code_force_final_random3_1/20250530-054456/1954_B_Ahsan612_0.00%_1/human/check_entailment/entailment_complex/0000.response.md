Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it iterates through the array to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer.

The program correctly handles the case where the array consists of identical numbers, in which case it prints -1. It also correctly handles the case where the array contains different numbers, in which case it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer.

The program uses a variable `minn` to keep track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer, and it updates this variable as it iterates through the array. The program also uses a variable `same` to keep track of the current number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
