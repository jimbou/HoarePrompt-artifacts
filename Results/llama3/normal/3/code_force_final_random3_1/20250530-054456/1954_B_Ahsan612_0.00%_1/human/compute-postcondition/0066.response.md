The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`.  If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 or 3 and `n` is greater than 1 and `ar` is a list of `n` integers. For the loop to be executed one more time `n` needed to have been greater than 3 and `ar` needed to have been a list of `n` integers and `i` must be less than `n`. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, if the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinite, `i` is 2, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**
