The only variable in the loop head is variable i and ar, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and ar. If i is less than len(ar), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, i is 1, ar is a list of n integers. ar being a list of n integers does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ar must be a list of at least 2 integers. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of at least 2 integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1**
