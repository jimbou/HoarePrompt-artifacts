The variable in the loop head is variable i and variable ar, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and variable ar.  If i is less than len(ar), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 3 or 4, ar is a list of n integers and n is an integer greater than 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time the length of ar must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers and the length of ar must be greater than 4, `same` is 1, 2 or 3, `num` is the first, second or third integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1 or infinite, and `i` is 3 or 4, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**
