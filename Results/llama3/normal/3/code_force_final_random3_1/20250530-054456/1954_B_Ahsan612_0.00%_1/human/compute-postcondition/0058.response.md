Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is infinite, i is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value from the input, and `ar` is a list of `n` integers from the input. The variable `same` is initialized to 1, and `num` is set to the first integer in `ar`. The variable `minn` is set to infinity, and `i` is set to 1. The stdin now contains `t-5` test cases.
