To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3 or 4, and `ar` is a list of at least 3 or 4 integers, respectively.

To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` is either 3 or 4, we need to adjust the length of `ar` to be at least 4.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 4 integers, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `i` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 4, and `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2**
