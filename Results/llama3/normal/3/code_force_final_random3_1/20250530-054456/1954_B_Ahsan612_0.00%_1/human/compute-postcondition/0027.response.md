Output: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of n integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of all sequences of equal integers in `ar` and the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same` which is 1, and `i` is n. Additionally, `minn` is not equal to infinity, and the value of `minn` which is 1 is being printed**
