Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, ar is a list of n integers, minn is 1, same is 1, num is the integer at index i in ar, i is less than n, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it less than `n`. Then, it assigns the value of the integer at index `i` in `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (1) and the value of `same`. Since `same` is initially 1 or 2, `minn` remains 1. Finally, the value of `same` is set to 1.
