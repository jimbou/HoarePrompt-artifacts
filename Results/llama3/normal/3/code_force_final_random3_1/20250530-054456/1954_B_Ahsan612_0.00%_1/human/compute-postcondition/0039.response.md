Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is the integer at index `i+2` in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now 3, and the other conditions remain the same. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is now 2, and the other conditions remain the same. The values of `n`, `ar`, `minn`, and `stdin` are unchanged.
