Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers and len(ar) must be greater than n-1, `minn` is 1, `i` is increased by 1 and i must be less than n-1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 4, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`. Otherwise, if `same` is 2, then `same` is 3, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `i` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `same` is 3, `num` is the integer at index `i+2` in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` becomes 4 and `num` is still the first integer in `ar`. If `same` was 1, then `same` becomes 2 and `num` is still the integer at index `i` in `ar`. If `same` was 2, then `same` becomes 3 and `num` is still the integer at index `i+2` in `ar`. The values of `n`, `ar`, `minn`, `i`, and the number of test cases in stdin remain unchanged.
