Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, and `i` is `i+1`.***
