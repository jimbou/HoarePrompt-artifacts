Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of n integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of all sequences of equal integers in `ar` and the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same` which is 1, and `i` is n.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same` which is 1. This means that `minn` now holds the minimum length of all sequences of equal integers in `ar`, which is either its previous value or 1, whichever is smaller. The other variables remain unchanged, with `same` still being 1, indicating that the loop has started a new sequence of equal integers, and `num` still holding the last integer in `ar`. The variable `i` has reached the end of the list `ar`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
