Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinite, and `i` is 3, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and the first and second integers in `ar` are equal, then `num` is the third integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, and `i` is 4, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and the first and second integers in `ar` are not equal, then `same` is 2, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, and `i` is 4, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 3, and `ar` is still a list of `n` integers. The conditions for `same`, `num`, and `minn` are still dependent on the current value of `ar[i]` and the first and second integers in `ar`. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases.
