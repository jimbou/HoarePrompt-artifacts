Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `i` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 3, and `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is now 2, otherwise `i` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
