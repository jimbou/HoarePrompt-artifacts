Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program iterates through the array and keeps track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer. If no such occurrences are found (i.e., the array consists of identical numbers), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases. For example, if the array consists of identical numbers, it correctly prints -1. If the array has multiple segments of consecutive occurrences of the same integer, it correctly finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
