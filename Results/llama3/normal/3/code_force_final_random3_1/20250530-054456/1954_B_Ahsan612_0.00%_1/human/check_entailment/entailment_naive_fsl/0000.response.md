Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only one element. In this case, the program will print -1, but the correct output should be 0, because removing 0 elements is enough to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

1
1

The program will print -1, but the correct output should be 0.

The issue is that the program does not handle the case when the input array has only one element correctly. It assumes that the array will always have at least two elements, and it does not check for the case when the array has only one element.
