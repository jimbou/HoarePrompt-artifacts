According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 3, and `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers. For the loop to be executed one more time, `ar` must have at least 3 integers if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `ar` must have at least 4 integers. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 3 integers if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `ar` is a list of at least 4 integers, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `i` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 3, and `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1**
