Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the second integer in ar, minn is 1, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 2. It then assigns the second integer in the list `ar` to `num`, since `i` is now 2. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (infinite) and `same` (1), resulting in `minn` becoming 1. Finally, the value of `same` is reset to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
