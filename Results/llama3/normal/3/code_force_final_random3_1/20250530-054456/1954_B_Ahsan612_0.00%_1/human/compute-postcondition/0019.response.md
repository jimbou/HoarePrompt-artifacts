Output State: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar`, and `i` is equal to `n`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has traversed the entire list `ar` and has found the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list. The variable `minn` holds this minimum value, and the variable `num` holds the last integer in the list. The variable `same` is reset to 1, and the variable `i` is equal to the length of the list `n`. The state of the other variables, `stdin` and `n`, remains unchanged.
