Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 3 integers if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `ar` is a list of at least 4 integers, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `i` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 4, and `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is now 3, otherwise `i` is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the list `ar` and the variables `n`, `num`, `minn`, and `same` retain their previous values.
