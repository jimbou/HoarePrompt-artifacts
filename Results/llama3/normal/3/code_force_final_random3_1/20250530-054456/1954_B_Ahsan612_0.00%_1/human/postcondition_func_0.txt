This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer in each test case. If no such occurrences are found, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
