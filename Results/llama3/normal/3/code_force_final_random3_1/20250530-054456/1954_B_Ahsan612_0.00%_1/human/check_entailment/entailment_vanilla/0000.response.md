Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive occurrences of the same number. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive occurrences seen so far.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.
3. It initializes variables to keep track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the same number (`same`) and the minimum count seen so far (`minn`).
4. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the previous one. If they are the same, it increments the `same` count. If they are different, it updates the `minn` value with the minimum of the current `minn` and the `same` count, and resets the `same` count to 1.
5. After iterating through the entire array, it updates the `minn` value one last time with the minimum of the current `minn` and the final `same` count.
6. If `minn` is still infinity, it means that the array consists of only one type of number, and it is impossible to make it stop being beautiful. In this case, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the `minn` value, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
