Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers and `len(ar)` must be greater than `n-1`, `minn` is 1, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than `n`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 4, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n`. Otherwise, if `same` is 2, then `same` is 3, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `i` is less than `n`. Otherwise, if `same` is 1, then `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `same` is 1, `i` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `same` is 3, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, and `i` is less than `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and it is now less than `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `same` and `num` are updated based on the new value of `i`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 4 and `num` is the first integer in `ar`. If `same` is 2, then `same` is 3 and `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`. If `same` is 1, then `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar` and `same` is 1. Otherwise, `same` is 3 and `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`.
