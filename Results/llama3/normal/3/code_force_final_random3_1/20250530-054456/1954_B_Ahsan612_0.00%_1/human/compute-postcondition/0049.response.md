Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar` or the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to `n`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`, which represents the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged.
