Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i+2` in `ar`, and `i` is `i+2`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `i` is now 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i+2` in `ar`, and `i` is now `i+2`. The values of `n`, `ar`, `minn`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
