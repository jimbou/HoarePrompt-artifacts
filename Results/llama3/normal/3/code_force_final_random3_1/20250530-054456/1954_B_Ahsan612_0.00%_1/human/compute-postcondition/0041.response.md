Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, ar is a list of n integers, minn is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the current value of ar[i] is equal to num, then same is 3, num is the first integer in ar, and i is less than n-1. Otherwise, if same is 1, then num is the integer at index i in ar, i is less than n. Otherwise, same is 2, num is the integer at index i+2 in ar, and i is less than n-1.***
