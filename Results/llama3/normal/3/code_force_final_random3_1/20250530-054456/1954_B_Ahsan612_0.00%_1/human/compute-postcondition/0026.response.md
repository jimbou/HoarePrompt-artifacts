Based on the precondition, the code prints the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of all sequences of equal integers in the list `ar` and the value of `same` which is 1. Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same` which is 1.

Output: **1 (which is the minimum of all sequences of equal integers in the list ar and the value of same)**
