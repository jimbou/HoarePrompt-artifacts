Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, ar is a list of n integers and the length of ar must be greater than 4, same is 1, num is the (i+1)th integer in ar, minn is the minimum of its original value and 1, 2 or 3, i is 4 or 5, and stdin contains t-6 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 4 or 5. It then assigns the `(i+1)`th integer in `ar` to `num`, effectively updating `num` to a new value. The `minn` variable is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the value of `same`, which is either 1, 2, or 3. Since `same` is then set to 1, its value is now fixed. The value of `n` and the list `ar` remain unchanged, as does the number of test cases in stdin, which is now `t-6`.
