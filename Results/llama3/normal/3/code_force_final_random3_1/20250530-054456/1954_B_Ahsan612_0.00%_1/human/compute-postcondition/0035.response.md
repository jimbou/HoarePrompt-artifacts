Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the integer at index i+1 in ar, minn is 1, i is i+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `num` has been updated to the integer at the new index `i` in the list `ar`. The value of `same` has been reset to 1, and the value of `minn` remains unchanged at 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
