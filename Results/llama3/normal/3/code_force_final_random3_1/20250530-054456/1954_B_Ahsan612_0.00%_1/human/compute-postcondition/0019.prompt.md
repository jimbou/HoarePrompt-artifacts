Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `i` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 3, and `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 3 integers if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `ar` is a list of at least 4 integers, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `i` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 4, and `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of at least 4 integers. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 4, and `same` is 4. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 5, and `same` is 3. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `num` is the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, `minn` is the minimum of positive infinity and 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` is the minimum of 1 and 2, `i` is 5 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 6, and `same` is 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
