Output State: **n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of n integers, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

Explanation:

* The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since stdin contains t-2 test cases, after reading one integer, it will contain t-3 test cases.
* The second line reads a list of n integers from stdin and assigns it to ar. The previous value of ar is discarded.
* The third line assigns 1 to same. The previous value of same is discarded.
* The fourth line assigns the first integer in ar to num. The previous value of num is discarded.
* The fifth line assigns infinity to minn. However, since minn is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of same, which is 1, minn becomes 1.
* The sixth line assigns 1 to i. The previous value of i is discarded.

Note that the initial state of minn is not explicitly mentioned, but since it is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of same, which is 1, we can infer that the initial value of minn is greater than or equal to 1.
