The code increments the value of `same` by 1. The initial value of `same` is 1, so the new value of `same` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The value of n is still an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case. ar is still a list of at least 2 integers. num is still the first integer in ar. minn is still positive infinity. i is still 1. The current value of ar[i] is still equal to num.

Output State: **`same` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, ar is a list of at least 2 integers, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, and the current value of ar[i] is equal to num.**
