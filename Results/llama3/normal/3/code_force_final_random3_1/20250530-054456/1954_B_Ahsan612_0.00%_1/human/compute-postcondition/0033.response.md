Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `same` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer greater than 1, `ar` being a list of `n` integers, `num` being the first integer in `ar`, `minn` being 1, `i` being 1, and `stdin` containing `t-3` test cases. Additionally, the current value of `ar[i]` is still equal to `num`.
