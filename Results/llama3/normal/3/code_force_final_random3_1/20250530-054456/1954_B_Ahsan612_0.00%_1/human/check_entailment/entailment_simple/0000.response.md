Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the number of consecutive occurrences of the same element (`same`). Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences (`minn`) and resets the count of consecutive occurrences (`same`) for the new element.

The program correctly handles the case where the array consists of identical numbers, in which case it is impossible to make it stop being beautiful, and prints -1.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program prints the minimum count of consecutive occurrences (`minn`) as the answer. But this is not correct. The minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful is actually the minimum count of consecutive occurrences minus 1, because removing one element from a sequence of consecutive occurrences of the same element will make it stop being beautiful.

Therefore, the correct program should print `minn - 1` instead of `minn`.

Correctness: **False**
