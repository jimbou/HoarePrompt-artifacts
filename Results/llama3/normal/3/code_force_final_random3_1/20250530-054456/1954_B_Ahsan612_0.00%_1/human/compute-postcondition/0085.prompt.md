Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `ar` is a list of n integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of all sequences of equal integers in `ar` and the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same` which is 1, and `i` is n. If `minn` is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `minn` which is 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `same` is the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is equal to `n`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `minn` is infinite, -1 is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar` or the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar` which is `minn` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `n`, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If `minn` is infinite, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the original `minn` and 1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
