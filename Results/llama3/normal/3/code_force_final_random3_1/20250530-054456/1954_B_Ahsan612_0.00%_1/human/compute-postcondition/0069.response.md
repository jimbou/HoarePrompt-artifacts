Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `ar` is a list of `n` integers. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinite, `i` is 2, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and the first and second integers in `ar` are equal, then `num` is the third integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `i` is 3, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` and the first and second integers in `ar` are not equal, then `same` is 2, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases.***
