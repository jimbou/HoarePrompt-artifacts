Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k values that fit the given constraints. It uses the `func_1` function to find all the divisors of the numbers `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, and then filters out the divisors that do not meet the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x`. The program also correctly handles the case when `k = 2` by adding it to the output list.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It also handles all the edge cases, including when `n` and `x` are equal, and when `n` is less than `x`. The program's output matches the expected output for all the provided test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
