Output State: **x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 0. output1 is a list containing all the divisors of the first integer in x that are less than or equal to the square root of the first integer, in reverse order. output2 is a list containing the integer division of the first integer in x by each of the divisors in output1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list of divisors (output1) is reversed, while the other variables (x and output2) remain unchanged. The list of divisors is still related to the first integer in x, but now it is in reverse order.
