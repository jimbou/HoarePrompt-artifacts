This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 0. It calculates the divisors of the first integer that are less than or equal to its square root, and their corresponding integer divisions. The function returns a list containing the integer divisions in the order they were calculated, followed by the divisors in reverse order.
