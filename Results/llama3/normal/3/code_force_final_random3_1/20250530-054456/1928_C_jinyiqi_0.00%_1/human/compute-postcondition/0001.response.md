To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is greater than or equal to 1 (since `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1). However, the state before the loop starts already guarantees that the second integer in `x` is greater than 0, which implies that `x` is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to set `i` to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`x` is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 0, `i` is 1, output1 is an empty list, output2 is an empty list**
