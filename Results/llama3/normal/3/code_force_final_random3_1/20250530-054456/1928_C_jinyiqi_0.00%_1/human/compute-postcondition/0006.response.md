Output State: **x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 0, and the square root of the first integer (or the list as a whole, if applicable) must have an integer part greater than 1, i is 2, output1 is a list containing 1 and 2, output2 is a list containing the integer division of x by 1 and the integer division of x by 2.**

In this output state, the list `x` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The variable `i` also remains unchanged with a value of 2. The list `output1` now contains two elements: 1 (which was already present) and 2 (which was appended by the code). The list `output2` now contains two elements: the integer division of `x` by 1 (which was already present) and the integer division of `x` by 2 (which was appended by the code).
