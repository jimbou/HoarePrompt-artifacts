Postcondition: ***x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 0, and the square root of the first integer (or the list as a whole, if applicable) must have an integer part greater than 2, i is 3. If x is divisible by 3, output1 is a list containing 1, 2, and 3, and output2 is a list containing the integer division of x by 1, the integer division of x by 2, and the integer division of x by 3. If x is not divisible by 3, output1 is a list containing 1 and 2, and output2 is a list containing the integer division of x by 1 and the integer division of x by 2.***
