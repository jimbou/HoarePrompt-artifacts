Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even and non-negative. This is because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of moves must be even if the number of cubes is even, and odd if the number of cubes is odd. Additionally, the number of moves must be greater than or equal to the number of cubes, because Nikita cannot remove more cubes than he has.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when n and m are both even or both odd, and when n is greater than or equal to m. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
