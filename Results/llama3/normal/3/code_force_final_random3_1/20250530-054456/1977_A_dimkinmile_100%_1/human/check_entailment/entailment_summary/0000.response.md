Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower. The program provided attempts to solve this problem by checking if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative.

However, the program's logic is incorrect. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` does not accurately represent the problem's requirements. This condition only checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative, but it does not consider the actual number of moves required to reach m cubes.

For example, in the second test case, the input is `2 4`. The program will output "No" because `(2 - 4) % 2 == 0` is False, but this is incorrect. Nikita can actually reach 4 cubes in 2 moves by adding 2 cubes in the first move and then adding 2 more cubes in the second move.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
