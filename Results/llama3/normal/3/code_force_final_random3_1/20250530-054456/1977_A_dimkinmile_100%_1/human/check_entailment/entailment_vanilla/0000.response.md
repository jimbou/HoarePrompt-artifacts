Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program defines a function `func_1()` that takes the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` as input. It then checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes", indicating that it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The reasoning behind this logic is as follows:

* If `n` is even, Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs, ending up with an even number of cubes. If `m` is also even, it's possible to end up with exactly m cubes.
* If `n` is odd, Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs, but there will be one cube left over. If `m` is also odd, it's possible to end up with exactly m cubes.
* If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it's possible to add or remove cubes to end up with exactly m cubes.

The program correctly implements this logic using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, and a simple comparison to check if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop, but it's not defined until after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined when it's called.

To fix this, the function definition should be moved above the loop.

Correctness: **False** (due to the function definition issue)
