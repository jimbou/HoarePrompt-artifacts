Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where in each move, either one cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, it means that the number of moves (`n`) is sufficient to add or remove the required number of cubes to reach `m`. If the difference is also non-negative, it means that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is a necessary condition to build a tower with `m` cubes.

However, the program's logic is incomplete. It only checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, but it does not consider the case where `n` is less than `m`. In such cases, it is not possible to build a tower with `m` cubes, regardless of the parity of the difference.

For example, if `n` is 3 and `m` is 5, the program will print "Yes" because the difference between `n` and `m` is even (2), but it is not possible to build a tower with 5 cubes in 3 moves.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
