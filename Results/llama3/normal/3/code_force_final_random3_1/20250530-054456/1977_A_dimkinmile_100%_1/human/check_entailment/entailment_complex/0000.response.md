Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The given program checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative. This is a correct approach because:

* If the difference is even, it means that the number of moves (n) is either equal to the number of cubes (m) or greater than m by an even number. In this case, it is possible to end up with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.
* If the difference is non-negative, it means that the number of moves (n) is greater than or equal to the number of cubes (m). This is a necessary condition because we cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

The program correctly prints 'Yes' if the difference is even and non-negative, and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
