Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to heap[0], heap contains at least one element less than or equal to current_median and is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median index to the end, operations is 2, smallest is an integer equal to the second smallest element that was in heap plus 1**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Since `heap` contains at least two elements less than or equal to `current_median`, after this operation, `heap` will contain at least one element less than or equal to `current_median`.
- The second line adds the value of `smallest + 1` back into the heap. This operation does not change the number of elements in the heap that are less than or equal to `current_median`, but it does change the value of `smallest` to be equal to the second smallest element that was in the heap plus 1.
- The third line increments the value of `operations` by 1, making it equal to 2.

All other variables remain unchanged.
