Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap contains the same elements as before except all elements less than or equal to current_median are now greater than current_median, operations is 0, smallest is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in heap, and heap is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median index to the end.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as 1. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, containing lists of integers where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers. The `results` list remains unchanged, containing the number of elements in `heap` that were less than or equal to `current_median`. The value of `n` is updated to a positive integer. The `arr` list is updated to a sorted list of `n` positive integers. The `median_index` is updated to an integer. The `current_median` is updated to a positive integer. The `heap` contains the same elements as before, except all elements less than or equal to `current_median` are now greater than `current_median`. The `operations` variable is reset to 0. The `smallest` variable remains unchanged as an integer equal to the smallest element that was in `heap`. The `heap` is updated to a heapified list containing the elements of `arr` from the median index to the end.
