According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables heap and current_median. If heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, heap[0] is less than current_median, so for the loop to be executed one more time heap[0] must be less than or equal to current_median.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median and the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median in the current test case, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median_index to the end and heap[0] must be less than or equal to current_median, operations is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median plus 1, smallest is an integer equal to the second largest element that was in heap plus 1**
