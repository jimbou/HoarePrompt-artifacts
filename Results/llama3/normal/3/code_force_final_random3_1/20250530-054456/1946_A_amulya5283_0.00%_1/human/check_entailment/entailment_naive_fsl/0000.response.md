Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input array has an even number of elements, the program does not correctly calculate the median. In the case of an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but the program only considers the first middle element.

For instance, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will return 2 as the median, but the correct median is 2.5 (the average of 2 and 3). This is because the program only considers the first middle element (2) and does not take into account the second middle element (3).

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
