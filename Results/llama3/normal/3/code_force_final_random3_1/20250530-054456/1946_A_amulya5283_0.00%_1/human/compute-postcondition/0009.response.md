Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap contains no elements less than or equal to current_median, operations is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, smallest is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in heap, heap contains the same elements as before except all elements less than or equal to current_median are now greater than current_median.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the heap that are less than or equal to the current median. In each iteration, the smallest element in the heap is removed, incremented by 1, and then added back to the heap. This process continues until there are no more elements in the heap that are less than or equal to the current median.

After the loop finishes executing, the heap will contain the same elements as before, but all elements that were less than or equal to the current median will have been incremented to be greater than the current median. The number of operations performed will be equal to the number of elements in the heap that were less than or equal to the current median. The smallest element that was in the heap will be the smallest element that was incremented. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
