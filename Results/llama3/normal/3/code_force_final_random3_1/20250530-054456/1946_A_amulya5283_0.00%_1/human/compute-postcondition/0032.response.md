Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of elements in the heap that were less than or equal to the current median for each test case. The list contains results for all test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers, with the first integer being the number of elements in the list, followed by the actual list of integers. The heap is a heapified list containing the elements of the sorted list of integers from the median index to the end, and the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The operations count is equal to the number of elements in the heap that were less than or equal to the current median.**
