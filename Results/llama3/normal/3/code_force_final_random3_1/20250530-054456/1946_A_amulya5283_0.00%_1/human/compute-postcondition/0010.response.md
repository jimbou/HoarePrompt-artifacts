Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `heap` that were less than or equal to `current_median`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is a positive integer, `heap` contains no elements less than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap` that were less than or equal to `current_median`, `smallest` is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in `heap`, `heap` contains the same elements as before except all elements less than or equal to `current_median` are now greater than `current_median`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `results` list now contains the number of elements in `heap` that were less than or equal to `current_median`. All other variables remain unchanged.
