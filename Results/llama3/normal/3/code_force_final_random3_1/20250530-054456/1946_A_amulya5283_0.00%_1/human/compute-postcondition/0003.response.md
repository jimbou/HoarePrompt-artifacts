To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. This condition depends on the states of `heap` and `current_median`.

Given the initial state:

- `t` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is a positive integer
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers
- `median_index` is an integer
- `current_median` is a positive integer
- `heap` is a list of positive integers
- `operations` is 0

We only need to adjust the states of `heap` and `current_median` since they are the variables in the loop head.

For the loop to execute the first time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. Given that `heap` is a list of positive integers and `current_median` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that the smallest element in `heap` (which is `heap[0]` since it's a list of positive integers but not necessarily sorted) is indeed less than or equal to `current_median`.

Therefore, the state of `heap` needs to be adjusted to ensure it has at least one element that is less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `current_median` is already a positive integer, no adjustment is needed for it.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is a positive integer, `heap` must contain at least one element less than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is 0**
