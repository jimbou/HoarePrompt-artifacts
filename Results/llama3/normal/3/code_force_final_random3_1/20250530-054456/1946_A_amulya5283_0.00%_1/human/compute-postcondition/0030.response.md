Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median and the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median in the current test case and the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median plus the number of times the loop executed, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is a positive integer, `heap` is a heapified list containing the elements of `arr` from the `median_index` to the end and `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median plus the number of times the loop executed, `smallest` is an integer equal to the largest element that was in heap plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the value of `operations`, representing the number of elements in the heap that were less than or equal to the current median plus the number of times the loop executed.
