Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap is a list of positive integers, operations is 0**

The code snippet executes a series of operations on the input data. The first line assigns the value of the first element of the `test_cases` list to `n` and the second element to `arr`. The second line sorts the `arr` list in ascending order. The third line calculates the median index of the sorted `arr` list. The fourth line assigns the value of the element at the median index to `current_median`. The fifth line assigns the elements of `arr` from the median index to the end to the `heap` list. The sixth line converts the `heap` list into a heap data structure using the `heapq.heapify` function. The seventh line initializes the `operations` variable to 0.

The final state of the program includes the original variables `t`, `i`, `test_cases`, and `results`, as well as the new variables `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations`. The values of these variables are determined by the input data and the operations performed by the code.
