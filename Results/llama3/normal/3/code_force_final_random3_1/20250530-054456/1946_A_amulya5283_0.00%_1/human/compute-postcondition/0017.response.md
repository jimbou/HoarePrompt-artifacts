The variables in the loop head are heap and current_median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables heap and current_median. If heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, heap contains at least one element less than or equal to current_median and current_median is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to heap[0]. current_median being greater than or equal to heap[0] does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to current_median is greater than heap[0]. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer and must be greater than heap[0], heap contains at least one element less than or equal to current_median and is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median index to the end, operations is 2, smallest is an integer equal to the second smallest element that was in heap plus 1**
