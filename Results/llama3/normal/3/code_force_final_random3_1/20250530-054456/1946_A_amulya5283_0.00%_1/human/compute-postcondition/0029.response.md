Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median and the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median in the current test case, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median_index to the end and heap[0] is greater than current_median, operations is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median plus the number of times the loop executed, smallest is an integer equal to the largest element that was in heap plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the heap's smallest element is now greater than the current median. The number of operations has increased by the number of times the loop executed, and the smallest variable now holds the value of the largest element that was in the heap plus 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
