To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `heap` and `current_median`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`, and `current_median` is greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`, we can adjust `smallest` to be less than `current_median - 1`. This will ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to smallest + 1, operations is 2, smallest is less than current_median - 1, heap contains the same elements as before except the smallest element is now smallest + 1**
