Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap contains at least one element less than or equal to current_median, operations is 1, smallest is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in heap, heap contains the same elements as before except the smallest element is now smallest + 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `test_cases` list remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The `results` list remains empty as no elements are added to it by the code. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The `arr` list remains sorted as it is not modified by the code. The value of `median_index` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `current_median` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The `heap` now contains the same elements as before, except the smallest element has been incremented by 1. The value of `operations` has been incremented by 1. The value of `smallest` is now equal to the smallest element that was in the heap before the code executed.
