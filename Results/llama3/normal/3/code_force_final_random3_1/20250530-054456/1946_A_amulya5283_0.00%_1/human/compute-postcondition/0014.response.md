Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to heap[0], heap contains at least one element less than or equal to current_median and is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median index to the end, operations is 1, smallest is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in heap plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `smallest` has been updated to be the smallest element that was in `heap` plus 1, and the value of `operations` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
