To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `heap` that were less than or equal to `current_median`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is a positive integer, `heap` contains no elements less than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap` that were less than or equal to `current_median`, `smallest` is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in `heap`, `heap` contains the same elements as before except all elements less than or equal to `current_median` are now greater than `current_median`.**
