To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

The states of other objects (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, `operations`, and `smallest`) do not need to be adjusted, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median` and the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median` in the current test case, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is a positive integer and is greater than `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list containing the elements of `arr` from the `median_index` to the end, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median`, `smallest` is an integer equal to the largest element that was in heap plus 1**
