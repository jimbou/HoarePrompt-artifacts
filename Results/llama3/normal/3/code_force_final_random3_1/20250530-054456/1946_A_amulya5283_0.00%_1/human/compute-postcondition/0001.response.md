According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it more explicit, we can adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0. Additionally, the variable `i` is introduced in the loop head, which will take on values from 0 to `t-1`. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value it will take on.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, `results` is an empty list**
