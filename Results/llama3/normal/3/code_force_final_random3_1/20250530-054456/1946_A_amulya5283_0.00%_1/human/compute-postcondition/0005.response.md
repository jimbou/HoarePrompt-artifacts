To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `heap` and `current_median`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. At the end of the last iteration, `heap` contains at least one element less than or equal to `current_median`, and the smallest element in `heap` is now `smallest + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `heap` so that it still contains at least one element less than or equal to `current_median`. Since the smallest element in `heap` is now `smallest + 1`, we need to adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to smallest + 1, operations is 1, smallest is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in heap, heap contains the same elements as before except the smallest element is now smallest + 1**
