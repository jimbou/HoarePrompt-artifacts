    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median` for each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is a positive integer, `heap` is a heapified list containing the elements of `arr` from the `median_index` to the end and `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median`, `smallest` is an integer equal to the largest element that was in heap plus 1.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of elements in the heap that were less than or equal to the current median for each test case. The list contains results for all test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers, with the first integer being the number of elements in the list, followed by the actual list of integers. The heap is a heapified list containing the elements of the sorted list of integers from the median index to the end, and the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The operations count is equal to the number of elements in the heap that were less than or equal to the current median.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` test cases, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers. It sorts each list of integers, calculates the median, and then increments the smallest elements in the second half of the sorted list until the smallest element is greater than the median. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of increments performed for each test case.
