According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `heap` and `current_median`. If `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `heap` is a heapified list containing the elements of `arr` from the `median_index` to the end, and `current_median` is a positive integer and is greater than `heap[0]`. Since `current_median` is already greater than `heap[0]`, the loop can certainly execute one time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median and the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median in the current test case, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer and is greater than heap[0], heap is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median_index to the end, operations is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, smallest is an integer equal to the largest element that was in heap plus 1**
