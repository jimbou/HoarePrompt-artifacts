Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer and must be greater than heap[0], heap contains at least one element less than or equal to current_median and is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median index to the end, operations is 3, smallest is an integer equal to the second smallest element that was in heap plus 1**

Explanation:

The first line removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable smallest. Since heap contains at least one element less than or equal to current_median, smallest will be less than or equal to current_median.

The second line adds the value of smallest + 1 to the heap. This means that the new smallest element in the heap will be the second smallest element that was in heap plus 1.

The third line increments the value of operations by 1, making it 3.

All other variables remain unchanged.
