Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median and the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median in the current test case, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer and is greater than heap[0], heap is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median_index to the end, operations is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median plus 1, smallest is an integer equal to the second largest element that was in heap plus 1.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Since `heap` is a heapified list containing the elements of `arr` from the `median_index` to the end, the smallest element is the one at the top of the heap, which is also the largest element that was in the heap. Therefore, `smallest` becomes equal to the largest element that was in the heap plus 1.

- The second line adds the value of `smallest + 1` to the heap. This increases the value of the smallest element in the heap by 1.

- The third line increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` is equal to the number of elements in the heap that were less than or equal to `current_median`, this increment reflects the addition of one more element to the heap that is less than or equal to `current_median`.

The other variables remain unchanged.
