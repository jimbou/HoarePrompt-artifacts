Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer and is greater than heap[0], heap is a heapified list containing the elements of arr from the median index to the end, operations is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to current_median, smallest is an integer equal to the largest element that was in heap plus 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed until all elements in the heap are greater than the current median. The number of operations is equal to the number of elements in the heap that were less than or equal to the current median, and the smallest variable now holds the value of the largest element that was in the heap plus 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
