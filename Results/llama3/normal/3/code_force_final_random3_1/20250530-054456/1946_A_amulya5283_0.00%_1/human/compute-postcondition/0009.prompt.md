Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap is a list of positive integers, operations is 0
Code of the loop:
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap contains at least one element less than or equal to current_median, operations is 1, smallest is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in heap, heap contains the same elements as before except the smallest element is now smallest + 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to smallest + 1, operations is 2, smallest is an integer equal to the smallest element that was in heap, heap contains the same elements as before except the smallest element is now smallest + 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to smallest + 1, operations is 3, smallest is less than current_median - 1, heap contains the same elements as before except the smallest element is now smallest + 1, smallest is the smallest element that was in the heap.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
