Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median` for each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is a positive integer, `heap` is a heapified list containing the elements of `arr` from the `median_index` to the end and `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median`, `smallest` is an integer equal to the largest element that was in heap plus 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

* `t` remains a positive integer, but its value is not changed by the loop.
* `i` is equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times.
* `test_cases` remains a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers.
* `results` is a list containing the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median` for each test case.
* `n` is a positive integer, which is the size of the last test case.
* `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, which is the last test case.
* `median_index` is an integer, which is the index of the median of the last test case.
* `current_median` is a positive integer, which is the median of the last test case.
* `heap` is a heapified list containing the elements of `arr` from the `median_index` to the end, and `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`.
* `operations` is equal to the number of elements in heap that were less than or equal to `current_median`.
* `smallest` is an integer equal to the largest element that was in heap plus 1.

Note that the values of `t`, `i`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, `operations`, and `smallest` are updated after each iteration of the loop, but their types and relationships remain the same.
