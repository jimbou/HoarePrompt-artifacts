Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where each inner list contains a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to smallest + 1, operations is 3, smallest is less than current_median - 1, heap contains the same elements as before except the smallest element is now smallest + 1, smallest is the smallest element that was in the heap.**

In this output state, the value of `smallest` has been updated to be the smallest element that was in the heap. The heap now contains the same elements as before, except the smallest element is now `smallest + 1`. The value of `operations` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
