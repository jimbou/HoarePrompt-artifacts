Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `n` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `k` is less than or equal to 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code created a new list `nums` with `n` zeros, where `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^5.
