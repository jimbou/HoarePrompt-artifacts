Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases t and initializing an empty list results to store the output for each test case.

2. For each test case, the program reads two integers n and k, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.

3. The program defines a function func_1 that takes n and k as input and returns a list of n non-negative integers that satisfy the given conditions.

4. Inside func_1, the program initializes a list nums of size n with all elements set to 0.

5. The program then iterates over the range of n. In each iteration, it calculates the value of the current integer as (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, which is the maximum possible value that can be assigned to the current integer without exceeding k. This value is chosen to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the integers.

6. The program then subtracts the calculated value from k and assigns it to the current integer in the nums list.

7. After the loop, the program adds the remaining value of k to the last integer in the nums list to ensure that the sum of the integers equals k.

8. Finally, the program returns the nums list, which is appended to the results list.

9. After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case, separated by newline characters.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the integers while ensuring that their sum equals k.

Correctness: **True**
