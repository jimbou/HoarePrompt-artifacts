Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, n is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers where the first n elements are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are zeros, i is n - 1, k is reduced by (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 for n times**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `n` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `k` is reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for `n` times.
