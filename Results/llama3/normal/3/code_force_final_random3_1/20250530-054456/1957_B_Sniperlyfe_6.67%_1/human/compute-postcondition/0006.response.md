Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9, n is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers where the first three elements are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are zeros, i is 2, k is reduced by (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1**

The code modifies the list `nums` by assigning the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` to the element at index `i`, which is 2. This changes the third element of `nums` to this value. The value of `k` is then reduced by the value of `nums[i]`, which is the newly assigned value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
