Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where the first `n` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are zeros except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, and `n` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The value of `k` has been reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for `n` times.**
