Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `n` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are zeros except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for `n` times.**

In this output state, the value of `nums[-1]` has been updated to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, which is the result of adding `k` to the original value of `nums[-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
