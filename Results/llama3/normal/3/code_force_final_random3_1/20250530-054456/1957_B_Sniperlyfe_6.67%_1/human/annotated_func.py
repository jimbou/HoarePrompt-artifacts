#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers, n <= 2 * 10^5, k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, n is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers where the first n elements are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are zeros, i is n - 1, k is reduced by (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 for n times
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of integers where the first `n` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are zeros except the last element which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, and `n` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. The value of `k` has been reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for `n` times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a list of integers where the first `n` elements are the maximum possible value that can be represented by `k` bits minus 1, and the last element is the remaining value of `k` after subtracting the maximum possible value `n` times, given positive integers `n` and `k` as input.
