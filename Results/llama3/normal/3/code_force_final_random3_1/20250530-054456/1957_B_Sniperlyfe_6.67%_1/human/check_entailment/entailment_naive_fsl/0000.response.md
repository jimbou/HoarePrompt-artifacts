Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when n is 1 and k is greater than 0. In this case, the function func_1 will return a list with a single element that is less than k, which does not satisfy the condition that the sum of the sequence should be equal to k.

For example, if n is 1 and k is 5, the function func_1 will return [31], which is not correct because 31 is not equal to 5.

The correct output for this case should be [5], which can be achieved by modifying the function func_1 to handle the case when n is 1 separately.
