Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a series of inputs: the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 0, b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is equal to the number of times the integer x appears in the list s, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers, r is a string containing the characters at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each x in the list s, i is the last element in the list s, and r is printed, r is a string containing the characters at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each x in the list s

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 1, b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is equal to the number of times x appears in s and all other integers are 0, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers, r is a string containing the characters at index x in string a for each x in s, i is the last integer in the list, stdin contains no input, and the string r which is a string containing the characters at index x in string a for each x in s is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 2, b is a list of 26 integers with a single value equal to the number of times the corresponding letter appears in the string r and all other values 0, n is an integer, s is an empty list, r is a string containing all the letters of the alphabet that appear in the list s in the order they appear, i is undefined, and stdin contains no input, and an empty string is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
