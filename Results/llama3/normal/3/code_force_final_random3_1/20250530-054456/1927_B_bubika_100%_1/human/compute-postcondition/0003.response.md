To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If the list `s` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 0, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first element in the list `s`**
