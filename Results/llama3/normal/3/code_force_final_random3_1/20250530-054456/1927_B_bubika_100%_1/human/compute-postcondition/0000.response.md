Output State: **`a` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a series of inputs: the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The stdin still contains the same series of inputs as before, with the first line containing a single integer t, followed by each test case with a single integer n and a line of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
