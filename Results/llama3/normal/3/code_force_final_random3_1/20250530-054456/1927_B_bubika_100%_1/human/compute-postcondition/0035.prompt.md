You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a series of inputs: the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for t in range(int(input())):
        b = [0] * 26
        
        n = int(input())
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        r = ''
        
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        
        print(r)
        
    #State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is equal to the initial value of t, b is a list of 26 integers with a single value equal to the number of times the corresponding letter appears in the string r and all other values 0, n is an integer, s is an empty list, r is a string containing all the letters of the alphabet that appear in the list s in the order they appear, i is undefined, and stdin contains no input, and an empty string is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is equal to the initial value of t, b is a list of 26 integers with a single value equal to the number of times the corresponding letter appears in the string r and all other values 0, n is an integer, s is an empty list, r is a string containing all the letters of the alphabet that appear in the list s in the order they appear, i is undefined, and stdin contains no input, and an empty string is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
