The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line assigns a list of 26 zeros to `b`. The second line assigns an integer value greater than 0 to `n`. The third line assigns a list of integers to `s`. The fourth line assigns an empty string to `r`. 

The initial state is: `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0. 

After the execution of the code, `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` remains unchanged as 0, `b` becomes a list of 26 zeros, `n` becomes an integer greater than 0, `s` becomes a list of integers, and `r` becomes an empty string. 

Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 0, b is a list of 26 zeros, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers, r is an empty string**
