Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a series of inputs: the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for t in range(int(input())):
        b = [0] * 26
        
        n = int(input())
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        r = ''
        
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        
        print(r)
        
    #State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is equal to the initial value of t, b is a list of 26 integers with a single value equal to the number of times the corresponding letter appears in the string r and all other values 0, n is an integer, s is an empty list, r is a string containing all the letters of the alphabet that appear in the list s in the order they appear, i is undefined, and stdin contains no input, and an empty string is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it constructs a string r by mapping each integer in the list to a corresponding letter of the alphabet (where the first occurrence of an integer maps to 'a', the second to 'b', and so on), and prints the resulting string. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
