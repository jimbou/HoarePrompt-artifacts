Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 0, b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is equal to the number of times the integer x appears in the list s, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers, r is a string containing the characters at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each x in the list s, i is the last element in the list s**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The string 'a' remains unchanged.
* The variable 't' remains 0.
* The list 'b' contains the frequency of each integer in the list 's'. The integer at index x in 'b' is equal to the number of times the integer x appears in the list 's'.
* The variable 'n' remains an integer greater than 0.
* The list 's' remains unchanged.
* The string 'r' contains the characters at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for each x in the list 's'. The length of 'r' is equal to the length of 's'.
* The variable 'i' is the last element in the list 's'.
