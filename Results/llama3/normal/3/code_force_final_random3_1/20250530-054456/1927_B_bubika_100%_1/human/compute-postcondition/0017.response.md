Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 1, b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is 2 and all other integers are 0, n is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, r is a string containing the character at index x in string a plus the character at index x in string a, i is the second integer in the list, stdin contains no input**

In this final state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The value of `t` also remains the same as 1. The list `b` has been modified such that the integer at index `x` is now 2, and all other integers in the list remain 0. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 0. The list `s` continues to have at least 2 integers. The string `r` now contains the character at index `x` in string `a` plus the character at index `x` in string `a`. The value of `i` remains the second integer in the list. Stdin still contains no input.
