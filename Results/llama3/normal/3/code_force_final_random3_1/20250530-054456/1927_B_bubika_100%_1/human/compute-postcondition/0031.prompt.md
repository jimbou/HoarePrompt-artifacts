Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 2, b is a list of 26 zeros, n is an integer, s is a list of integers, r is an empty string, i is undefined, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 2, b is a list of 26 integers with a single 1 at index x and all other values 0, n is an integer, s is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, r is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet, i is the first integer in the list s.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 2, b is a list of 26 integers with a single 1 at index x and all other values 0 except at index x where the value is 2, n is an integer, s is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, r is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet followed by the x-th letter of the alphabet, i is the second integer in the list s, x is the index of the second integer in the list s

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is 2, b is a list of 26 integers with a single 1 at index x and all other values 0 except at index x where the value is 3, n is an integer, s is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, r is a string containing the x-th letter of the alphabet followed by the x-th letter of the alphabet and then the x-th letter of the alphabet, i is the third integer in the list s, x is the index of the third integer in the list s.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
