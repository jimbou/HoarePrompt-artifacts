Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it constructs a string r by mapping each integer in the list to a corresponding letter of the alphabet (where the first occurrence of an integer maps to 'a', the second to 'b', and so on), and prints the resulting string. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
