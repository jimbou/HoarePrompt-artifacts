Postcondition: **n is an integer between 3 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros, xx is a list containing a single empty string, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 strings of length n, i is 1, j is 3, if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[1] is 2 and b[3] is 1.**
