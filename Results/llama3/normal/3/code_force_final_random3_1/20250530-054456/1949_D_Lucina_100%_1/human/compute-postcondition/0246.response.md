Output State: **nx is a string of length n, where each character is 'S' if the corresponding character in string x is 'S' and the index is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, otherwise 'F'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string nx will be a string of length n, where each character is determined by the corresponding character in the original string x and its index in the list sb. If the character in x is 'S' and its index is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, then the character in nx will be 'S'. Otherwise, the character in nx will be 'F'.
