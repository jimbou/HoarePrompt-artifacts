Output State: **nx is a string that was n and now has 'F' appended to it, i is n + 1, n is at least 3, j is 3**

In this output state, the value of nx has been updated by appending 'F' to its original value, which was a string. The values of the other variables, i, n, and j, remain unchanged. The relationship between i and n is still maintained, with i being equal to n + 1. The constraint on n, being at least 3, is also still valid.
