The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 24 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros. b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[1] is 2 and b[2] is 1. xx is a list containing a single empty string, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 strings of length n, i is 1, and j is 3**
