Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `j` is n+1. `sa` is an empty list because `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is greater than 0. `sb` is a list containing the value 1 because `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains between 2 and 24. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `xx` and string `x` also remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1 and `j` is still n+1. The list `sa` is empty because the current value of `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is greater than 0. The list `sb` now contains the value 1, which is the current value of `i`.
