Postcondition: ***nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is at least 1, j is 1. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx contains the character at xx[i][j - 1]. If xx[i][j - 1] is '?', then nx contains either 'S' or 'F'. If the current value of i is in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or the current value of j is in sb[:n // 4 - 1], then nx contains 'S'. Otherwise, nx contains 'F'.***
