Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i`-th and `j`-th elements are `n` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', otherwise `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[1]` is `n-1` and `b[j]` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing `n+1` strings: an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n+1`, and `j` is `n+1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be as follows:

* `n` remains an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive).
* `a` will be a list of `n+1` integers, where the `i`-th and `j`-th elements will be `n` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` will be a list of `n+1` zeros.
* `b` will be a list of `n+1` integers, where the values at indices 1 and 1 will be both 1 and the rest will be 0 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F'. Otherwise, `b` will be a list of `n+1` integers where `b[1]` is `n-1` and `b[j]` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S'.
* `xx` will be a list containing `n+1` strings: an empty string and `n` strings `x`.
* `x` will be a string of length `n`.
* `stdin` will be empty.
* `i` will be `n+1`.
* `j` will be `n+1`.

Note that the state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
