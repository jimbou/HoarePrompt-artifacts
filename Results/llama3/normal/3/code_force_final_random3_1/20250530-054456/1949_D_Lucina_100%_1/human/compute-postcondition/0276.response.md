Output State: **nx is a string of length n, where each character is 'S' if the corresponding character in string x is 'S' and the index is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, otherwise 'F', and this string nx is being printed, and i is n+1, and j is n+1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string nx is a string of length n, where each character is 'S' if the corresponding character in string x is 'S' and the index is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, otherwise 'F'. This string nx is being printed. The variables i and j are both equal to n+1.
