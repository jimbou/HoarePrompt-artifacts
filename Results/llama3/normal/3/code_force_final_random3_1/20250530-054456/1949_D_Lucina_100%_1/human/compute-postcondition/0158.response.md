Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0 and also contains the values of i from 1 to n+1 if a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, `t` is the length of sa which is greater than or equal to the length of sb plus the number of times a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, `nx` is an empty string. The current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'***
