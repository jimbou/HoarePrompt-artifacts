Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i`-th and `j`-th elements are `n+1` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', otherwise `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[1]` is `n-1` and `b[j]` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing three strings: an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` that is the first input string from stdin, `stdin` contains `n-3` strings of length `n`, `i` is 3, and `j` is 1. Additionally, the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F'.***
