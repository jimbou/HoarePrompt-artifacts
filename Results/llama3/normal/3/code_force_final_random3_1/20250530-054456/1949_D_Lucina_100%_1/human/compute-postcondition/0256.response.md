Output State: **`nx` is a string containing 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `j` is `1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. The current value of `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or the current value of `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nx` has been updated to include the character 'S', while the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or the current value of `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` is still valid.
