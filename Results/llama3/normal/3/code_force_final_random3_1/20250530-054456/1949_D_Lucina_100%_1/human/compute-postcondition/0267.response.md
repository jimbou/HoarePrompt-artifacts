The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is at least 3, j is 3**
