Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than `n + 1`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is at least 1, j is 1. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx contains the character at xx[i][j - 1]. If xx[i][j - 1] is '?', then nx contains either 'S' or 'F'. If the current value of i is in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or the current value of j is in sb[:n // 4 - 1], then nx contains 'S'. Otherwise, nx contains 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is at least 1, j is 2. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', nx is the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1]. Otherwise, if i or j is in the first quarter of sb, nx is followed by 'S'. Otherwise, nx is followed by 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is at least 3, j is 3. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx is the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1]. Otherwise, if either i or j is present in the first n // 4 - 1 characters of nx, then nx ends with 'S'. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to nx.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
