To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `j`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2 and at most `n`. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 3 and at most n, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb now contains the values from 1 to n+1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j-1 of string x. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'S' if i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, or 'F' otherwise, and the character at index j-1 of string xx[i] is '?'. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then `nx` is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value and the character at index j-1 of string xx[i]. If xx[i][j - 1] is '?', then if i is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, `nx` is a string containing 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' appended to its previous value.**
