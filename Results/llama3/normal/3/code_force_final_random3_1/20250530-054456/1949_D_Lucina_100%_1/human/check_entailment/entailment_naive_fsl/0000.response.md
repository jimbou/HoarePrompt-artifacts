Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

10
.?F???????
?.????????
??.???????
???.??????
????.?????
?????.????
??????.???
???????.??
????????.??
?????????.

The program outputs:

.SFFFSFFFS
S.FFFSFFFF
SS.FFFSSFS
SFS.FFSSFS
FSSF.FFFFF
FSFFF.SFFS
SFFSFS.SFS
SFFSFFS.SF
SFFSFSSSS
FFFFFFFFFF

However, this output does not satisfy the condition that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than ⌈3n/4⌉ transition videos of the same type in a row. For instance, if the player plays the scenarios in the order 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, they will see 7 funny videos in a row, which is more than ⌈3*10/4⌉ = 7.

The program's logic is flawed because it only considers the number of funny and scary videos for each scenario, but it does not take into account the order in which the scenarios are played. It simply assigns funny or scary to the undecided videos based on the number of funny and scary videos for each scenario, without considering the overall sequence of videos. This approach does not guarantee that the condition will be satisfied for all possible orders of playing the scenarios.
