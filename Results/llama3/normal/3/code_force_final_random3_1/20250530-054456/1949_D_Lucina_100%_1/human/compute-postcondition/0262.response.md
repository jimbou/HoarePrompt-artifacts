Output State: **nx is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1], i is n + 1, n is at least 1, j is 2**

In this output state, the value of nx has been updated by appending the value of xx[i][j - 1] to its original value. The values of i, n, and j remain unchanged. The value of n is still at least 1, and the value of j is still 2. The value of i is still equal to n + 1.
