The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is at least 3, a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n+3 and the rest are n+1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are 1 and the rest are 0. b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise b[i] is 2, b[j] is 2, and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S', otherwise b[1] is n-1, b[j] is 2. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', then b[i] is b[i]+1, b[j] is b[j]+1, and the rest are the same as before if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S'. xx is a list containing three strings: an empty string, string x, and string x, x is a string of length n that is the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-3 strings of length n, i is 3, and j is 3.**
