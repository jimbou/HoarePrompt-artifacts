Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros, if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1, xx is a list containing two strings: an empty string and string x, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-2 strings of length n, i is 2, j is between 1 and n (inclusive), and the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', b[i] is 2, b[j] is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `b[i]` and `b[j]` have been incremented by 1 due to the code execution. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
