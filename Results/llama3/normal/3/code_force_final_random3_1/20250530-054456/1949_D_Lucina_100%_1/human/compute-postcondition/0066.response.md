Output State: **`a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n+1 and the rest are n+1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n-2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n-3 and the rest are 0. `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise b[i] is n-2, b[j] is n-2, and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S', otherwise b[1] is n-1, b[j] is n-2. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', then b[i] is b[i]+1, b[j] is b[j]+1, and the rest are the same as before if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S'. `xx` is a list containing four strings: an empty string, string x, string x, and string x. `x` is a string of length n that is the first input string from stdin. `stdin` contains n-3 strings of length n. `i` is n. `j` is n+1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` remains the same as before, with its elements determined by the characters in string `x`. The list `b` also remains the same, with its elements determined by the characters in string `x` and the values of `i` and `j`. The list `xx` now contains four strings: an empty string, string `x`, string `x`, and string `x`. The string `x` is still the first input string from stdin, and stdin still contains n-3 strings of length n. The values of `i` and `j` are still n and n+1, respectively.
