Output State: **`nx` is a string containing 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `j` is `1`, `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]**

In this output state, the variable `nx` has been updated to contain the character 'F', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `nx` now contains at least one character, whereas it was initially empty. The rest of the conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
