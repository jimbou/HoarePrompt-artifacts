To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and the range `1` to `n + 1`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to `1`. Since `n` is currently greater than `n + 1`, which is impossible, we need to adjust `n` to be at least `1`.

Additionally, since `j` is the loop variable, we can set its initial value to `1`, which is the starting value of the range.

The state of `nx` is not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `j` is `1`**
