Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n+2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are 2, b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', xx is a list containing two strings: an empty string and string x, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-2 strings of length n, i is 2, j is between 2 and n (inclusive), and if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[i] is 2 and b[j] is 2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b[i] is not changed and b[j] is 1**

The code increments the i-th and j-th elements of list a by 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', the i-th and j-th elements of a become n+2. Otherwise, they become 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
