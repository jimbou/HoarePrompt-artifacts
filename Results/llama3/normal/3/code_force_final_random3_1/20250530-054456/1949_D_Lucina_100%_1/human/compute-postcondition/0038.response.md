The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is between 2 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is between 3 and `n+1` (inclusive), and `n` remains the same.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the i-th and j-th elements are `n+2` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the i-th and j-th elements are 2 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the i-th and j-th elements are `n+1` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', otherwise `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[1]` is `n-1` and `b[j]` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing two strings: an empty string and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `stdin` contains `n-2` strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is between 3 and `n+1` (inclusive), and if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` is 2 and `b[j]` is 2 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', otherwise `b[i]` is not changed and `b[j]` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` is 3 and `b[j]` is 3 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', otherwise `b[i]` is 1 and `b[j]` is 2.**
