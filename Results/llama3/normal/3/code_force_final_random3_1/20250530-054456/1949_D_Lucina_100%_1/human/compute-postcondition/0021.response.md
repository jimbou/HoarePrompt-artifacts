Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros, if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1, xx is a list containing a single empty string, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 strings of length n, i is 1, and j is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged, which is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive).
* The list `a` has its `i-th` and `j-th` elements set to `n` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise all elements in `a` are zeros.
* The list `b` has its values at indices 1 and 1 set to 1 and the rest set to 0 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F'. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is set to `n-1` and `b[j]` is set to 1.
* The list `xx` remains unchanged, containing a single empty string.
* The string `x` remains unchanged, with a length of `n`.
* The `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `n-1` strings of length `n`.
* The variable `i` remains unchanged, set to 1.
* The variable `j` is set to `n` after the loop completes all iterations.
