Output State: **`nx` is a string containing the character at `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` is at least `1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `1`**

In this output state, the value of `nx` has been updated by appending the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` to its previous value, which was an empty string. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The precondition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?' is still valid, and its value is now part of the string `nx`.
