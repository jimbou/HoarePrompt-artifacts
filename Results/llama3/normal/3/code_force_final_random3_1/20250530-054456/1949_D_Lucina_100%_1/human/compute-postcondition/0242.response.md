Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, stdin is empty, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb now contains the values from 1 to n+1. If the character at index j-1 of string xx[i] is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j - 1 of string xx[i] followed by the character at index j - 1 of string xx[i]. If the character at index j-1 of string xx[i] is '?', then `nx` is a string 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is a string 'F' followed by the character at index j - 1 of string xx[i]. If `i` is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of `sb`, then `nx` is a string containing 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is a string 'F' appended to its previous value. The characters at indices 0 to n-1 of string xx[i] are '?', and nx is printed. `nx` is a string containing 'S' appended to its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `nx` has been updated to contain 'S' appended to its previous value.
