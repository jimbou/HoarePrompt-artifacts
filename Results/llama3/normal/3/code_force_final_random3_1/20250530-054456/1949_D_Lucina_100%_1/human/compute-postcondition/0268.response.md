Output State: **nx is a string that is the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1], i is n + 1, n is at least 3, j is 3**

In this output state, the value of nx has been updated by appending the value of xx[i][j - 1] to its original value. The values of i, n, and j remain unchanged. Note that the exact value of nx cannot be determined without knowing the original value of nx and the value of xx[i][j - 1].
