Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', xx is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, x is a string of length n, stdin is empty, i is n+1, j is n+1, sa is an empty list, sb is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `j` is n+1. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is greater than 0, then `sa` is an empty list and `sb` is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` are not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `j` is n+1. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is greater than 0, then `sa` is a list containing the value 2 and `sb` is a list containing the values 1 and 2. If `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing the value 2 and `sb` is a list containing the value 1 and 2. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` are lists containing the value 2 and the value 1 respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', xx is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, x is a string of length n, stdin is empty, i is 3, j is n+1. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is greater than 0, then sa is a list containing the values 3 and 3 and sb is a list containing the values 1, 3 and 3. If a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, then sa is a list containing the values 3 and 3 and sb is a list containing the value 1 and 3 and 3. If a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, then sa is a list containing the values 3 and 3 and sb is a list containing the value 1 and 3 and 3. Otherwise, sa is a list containing the values 3 and 3 and sb is a list containing the value 1 and 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
