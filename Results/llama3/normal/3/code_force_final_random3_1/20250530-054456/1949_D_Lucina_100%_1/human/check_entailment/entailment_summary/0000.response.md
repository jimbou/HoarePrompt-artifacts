Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes it, and prints the results. The program first reads an integer n (2 <= n <= 24) and then n strings of length n, each containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .. The program then analyzes the input strings, identifies the characters at each position, and prints the processed strings. If the length of the list of indices where 'F' appears is greater than or equal to the length of the list of indices where 'S' appears, it replaces '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices. Otherwise, it replaces '?' with 'S' or 'F' based on the indices. The program prints the processed strings.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the requirement that no more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type can appear consecutively. The program also correctly handles the case where the length of the list of indices where 'F' appears is greater than or equal to the length of the list of indices where 'S' appears, and the case where the length of the list of indices where 'S' appears is greater than the length of the list of indices where 'F' appears.

Correctness: **True**
