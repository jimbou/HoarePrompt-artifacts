Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 zeros, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` contains n-1 strings of length n, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `x` is a string of length `n` because `input()` accepts a string from `stdin` and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive). The value of `stdin` is updated to contain `n-1` strings of length `n` because one string has been consumed by `input()`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
