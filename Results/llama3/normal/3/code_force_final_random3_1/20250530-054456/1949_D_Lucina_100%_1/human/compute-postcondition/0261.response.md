To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

The state of `nx`, `i`, and `xx` are not relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

The state of `sb` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is at least 1, j is 2**

Note that the state of `nx` is still a string, but its value may change depending on the values of `xx`, `i`, and `j`. However, since `nx` is not part of the loop head, its state is not adjusted.
