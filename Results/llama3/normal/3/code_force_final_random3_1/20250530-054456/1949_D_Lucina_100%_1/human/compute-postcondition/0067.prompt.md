Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 zeros, xx is a list containing a single empty string, stdin contains n strings of length n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros, if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1, `xx` is a list containing two strings: an empty string and string x, `x` is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 strings of length n, `i` is 1, and `j` is n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i`-th and `j`-th elements are `n+1` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', otherwise `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[1]` is `n-1` and `b[j]` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing three strings: an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `stdin` contains `n-2` strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, and `j` is `n+1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n+1 and the rest are n+1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n-2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n-3 and the rest are 0. `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise b[i] is n-2, b[j] is n-2, and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S', otherwise b[1] is n-1, b[j] is n-2. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', then b[i] is b[i]+1, b[j] is b[j]+1, and the rest are the same as before if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S'. `xx` is a list containing four strings: an empty string, string x, string x, and string x. `x` is a string of length n that is the first input string from stdin. `stdin` contains n-3 strings of length n. `i` is n. `j` is n+1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
