The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and n. If i is less than n + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is n, n is n. For the loop to execute again i must be n + 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than n + 1.
State: **nx is a string of length n + 1, where each character is 'S' if the corresponding character in string x is 'S' and the index is in the first (n + 1) // 4 - 1 elements of sb, otherwise 'F', and this string nx is being printed, i is n + 1, n must be greater than n + 1**
