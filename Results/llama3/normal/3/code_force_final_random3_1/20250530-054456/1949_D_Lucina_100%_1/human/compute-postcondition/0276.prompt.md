Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb now contains the values from 1 to n+1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', xx is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, x is a string of length n, stdin is empty, i is 1, j is n+1, sa is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb now contains the values from 1 to n+1. nx is a string containing the characters at indices 0 to n-1 of string x if the characters at indices 0 to n-1 of string x are not '?', otherwise nx is a string containing 'S' if i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, or 'F' otherwise, and the characters at indices 0 to n-1 of string xx[i] are '?', and nx is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: nx is a string of length n, where each character is 'S' if the corresponding character in string x is 'S' and the index is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, otherwise 'F', and this string nx is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is greater than n + 1, j is n + 1. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx is the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1]. Otherwise, if either i or j is present in the first n // 4 - 1 characters of sb, then nx ends with 'S'. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to nx., and nx is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
