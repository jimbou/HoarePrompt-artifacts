Output State: **a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n+1 and the rest are n+1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n-2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n-3 and the rest are 0. b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise b[i] is n-2, b[j] is n-2, and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S', otherwise b[1] is n-1, b[j] is n-2. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', then b[i] is b[i]+1, b[j] is b[j]+1, and the rest are the same as before if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S'. xx is a list containing three strings: an empty string, string x, and string x, x is a string of length n that is the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-3 strings of length n, i is n, and j is n+1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The list `a` will have its `i-th` and `j-th` elements set to `n+1` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise it will be set to `n-2` if the character is 'S', and `n-3` otherwise. The rest of the elements in `a` will be set to `n+1` if the character is 'F', and 0 otherwise.

- The list `b` will have its values at indices 1 and 1 set to 1 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', otherwise it will be set to `n-1` and 1 respectively if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S'. If the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` will be set to `n-2`, `b[j]` will be set to `n-2`, and the rest will be 0. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', then `b[i]` will be incremented by 1, `b[j]` will be incremented by 1, and the rest will remain the same if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S'.

- The list `xx` will remain unchanged, containing three strings: an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`.

- The string `x` will remain unchanged, being a string of length `n` that is the first input string from stdin.

- The variable `stdin` will remain unchanged, containing `n-3` strings of length `n`.

- The variable `i` will be set to `n`.

- The variable `j` will be set to `n+1`.
