Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `j` is n+1, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb now contains the values from 1 to n+1, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 1 and at most n, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb now contains the values from 1 to n+1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j-1 of string x. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'S' if i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, or 'F' otherwise, and the character at index j-1 of string xx[i] is '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most n, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb now contains the values from 1 to n+1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j-1 of string x. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'S' if i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, or 'F' otherwise, and the character at index j-1 of string xx[i] is '?'. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then `nx` is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value and the character at index j-1 of string xx[i]. If xx[i][j - 1] is '?', then if i is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, `nx` is a string containing 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' appended to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', xx is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, x is a string of length n, stdin is empty, i is 1, j is at least 3 and at most n, sa is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb now contains the values from 1 to n+1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not '?', then nx is a string containing the character at index j-1 of string x. Otherwise, nx is either 'S' if i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, or 'F' otherwise, and the character at index j-1 of string xx[i] is '?'. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value and the character at index j-1 of string xx[i]. If xx[i][j - 1] is '?', then if i is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, nx is a string containing 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, nx is a string containing 'F' appended to its previous value. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value and the character at index j-1 of string xx[i]. If i is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sb, then nx is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value and 'S'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
