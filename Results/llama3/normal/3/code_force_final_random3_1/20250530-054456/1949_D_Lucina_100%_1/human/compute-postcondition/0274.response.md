Based on the precondition, let's break down the possible values of `nx`:

1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the concatenation of its original value and the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. This means `nx` will have a value that is a combination of its original value and the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then there are two possibilities:
	* If either `i` or `j` is present in the first `n // 4 - 1` characters of `sb`, then `nx` ends with 'S'.
	* Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.

Since we don't have explicit values for `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, `j`, `n`, or `sb`, we can't determine the exact value of `nx`. However, based on the conditions, we can describe the possible values of `nx`:

Output: **nx (where nx is either the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1], or ends with 'S' if i or j is present in the first n // 4 - 1 characters of sb, or ends with 'F' otherwise)**
