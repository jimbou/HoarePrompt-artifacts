Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i`-th and `j`-th elements are `n` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', otherwise `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[1]` is `n-1` and `b[j]` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing `n+1` strings: an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, stdin is empty, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0 and also contains the values of `i` from 1 to `n+1` if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `t` is the length of `sa` which is greater than or equal to the length of `sb` plus the number of times `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `nx` is a string containing the character at index `j-1` of string `x` if the character is not '?', otherwise `nx` is a string containing either 'F' or 'S' depending on the current value of `i` and `j` in `sa`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` has been appended with the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` of `xx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` has been appended with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` has been appended with 'S'.**

The code appends the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` of `xx` to `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is appended with the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` of `xx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is appended with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'S'. The values of the other variables are not affected.
