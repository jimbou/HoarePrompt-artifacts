To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 2 (incremented by 1 from the previous value of 1)
* `n` remains an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `x`, and `j`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros, if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1, `xx` is a list containing two strings: an empty string and string x, `x` is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 strings of length n, `i` is 2, and `j` is n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
