Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i`-th and `j`-th elements are `n+1` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` is 2, `b[j]` is 2, and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S', otherwise `b[1]` is `n-1`, `b[j]` is 2, `xx` is a list containing three strings: an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` that is the first input string from stdin, `stdin` contains `n-3` strings of length `n`, `i` is 3, and `j` is 1.***
