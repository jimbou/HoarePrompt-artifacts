This function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It first reads an integer n (2 <= n <= 24) and then n strings of length n, each containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .. The function then analyzes the input strings, identifies the characters at each position, and prints the processed strings. If the length of the list of indices where 'F' appears is greater than or equal to the length of the list of indices where 'S' appears, it replaces '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices. Otherwise, it replaces '?' with 'S' or 'F' based on the indices. The function prints the processed strings.
