Output State: **nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is greater than n + 1, j is n + 1. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx is the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1]. Otherwise, if either i or j is present in the first n // 4 - 1 characters of sb, then nx ends with 'S'. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to nx.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a string nx, where i is n + 1, and n is greater than n + 1. The value of nx is determined by the values of xx[i][j - 1] and the presence of i or j in the first n // 4 - 1 characters of sb. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx is the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1]. If xx[i][j - 1] is '?', then nx ends with 'S' if either i or j is present in the first n // 4 - 1 characters of sb, and 'F' otherwise.
