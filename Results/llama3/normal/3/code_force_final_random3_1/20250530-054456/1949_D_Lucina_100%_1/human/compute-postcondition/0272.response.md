Postcondition: ***nx is a string, i is n + 1, n is at least 3, j is 3. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx is the concatenation of its original value and the value of xx[i][j - 1]. Otherwise, if either i or j is present in the first n // 4 - 1 characters of nx, then nx ends with 'S'. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to nx.***
