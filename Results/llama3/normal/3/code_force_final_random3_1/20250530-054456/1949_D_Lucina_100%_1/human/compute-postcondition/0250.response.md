Output State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than `n + 1`**.

In this output state, the value of `nx` has been changed to an empty string, while the values of `i` and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The condition that `n` is greater than `n + 1` is still valid.
