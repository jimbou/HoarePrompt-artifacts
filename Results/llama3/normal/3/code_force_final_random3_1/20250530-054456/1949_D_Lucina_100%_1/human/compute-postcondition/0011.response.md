The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1, n is between 2 and 24 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1, so j is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros. b is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros. xx is a list containing a single empty string, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 strings of length n, i is 1, and j is 2.**
