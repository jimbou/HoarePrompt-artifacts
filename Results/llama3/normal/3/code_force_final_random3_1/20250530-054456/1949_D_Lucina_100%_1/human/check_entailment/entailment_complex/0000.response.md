Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to replace the '?' characters in the input strings with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions specified in the problem statement. The program first identifies the indices where 'F' and 'S' appear in the input strings and stores them in the lists `sa` and `sb`, respectively. Then, it iterates over the input strings and replaces the '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in `sa` and `sb`. The program also handles the case where the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb` by appending the remaining indices to `sb`. The program prints the processed strings, which satisfy the condition that no more than $\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil$ transition videos of the same type appear consecutively.

Correctness: **True**
