Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', `xx` is a list containing n+1 strings: an empty string and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `j` is n+1. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is greater than 0, then `sa` is a list containing the value 2 and `sb` is a list containing the values 1 and 2. If `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing the value 2 and `sb` is a list containing the value 1 and 2. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` are lists containing the value 2 and the value 1 respectively.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `sb` has been appended with the value of `i`, which is 2. The conditions for `sa` and `sb` are still valid, but now `sb` contains an additional value, 2.
