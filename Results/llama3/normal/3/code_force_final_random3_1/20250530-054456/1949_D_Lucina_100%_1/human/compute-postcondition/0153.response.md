The code prints the string `nx` which is a string containing the character at index `j-1` of string `x` if the character is not '?', otherwise `nx` is a string containing either 'F' or 'S' depending on the current value of `i` and `j` in `sa`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` has been appended with the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` of `xx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` has been appended with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` has been appended with 'S'.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string containing either the character at index j-1 of string x, or 'F' or 'S' depending on the current value of i and j in sa)**
