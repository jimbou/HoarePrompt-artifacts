Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are n if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the values at indices 1 and 1 are both 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S' and the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros, if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[1] is n-1 and b[j] is 1, `xx` is a list containing two strings: an empty string and string x, `x` is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 strings of length n, `i` is 1, and `j` is n.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `xx` now contains two strings: an empty string and the string `x`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
