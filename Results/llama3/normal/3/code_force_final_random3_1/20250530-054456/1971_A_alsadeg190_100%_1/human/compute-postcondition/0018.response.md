Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first two inputs.**

The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the first two integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers except the first two inputs.
