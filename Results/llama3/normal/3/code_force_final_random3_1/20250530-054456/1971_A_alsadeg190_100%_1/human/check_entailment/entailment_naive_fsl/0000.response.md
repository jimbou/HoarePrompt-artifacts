Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. The program uses a simple if-else statement to compare x and y, and prints the smaller value first followed by the larger value. This logic is correct for all possible cases, including when x and y are equal.

The program also correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and then reading two integers for each test case. The use of the map function to convert the input strings to integers is also correct.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
