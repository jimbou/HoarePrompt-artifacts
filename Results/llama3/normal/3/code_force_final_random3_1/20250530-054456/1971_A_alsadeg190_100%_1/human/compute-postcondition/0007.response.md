The code prints the values of `y` and `x`, which are integers. Since `x` is not less than `y`, we know that `x` is either greater than or equal to `y`. However, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y` without knowing their specific integer values.
Output: **y (an integer), x (an integer not less than y)**
