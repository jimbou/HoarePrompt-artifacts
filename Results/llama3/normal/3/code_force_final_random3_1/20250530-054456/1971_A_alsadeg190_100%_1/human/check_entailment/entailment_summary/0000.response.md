Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y for multiple test cases. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers x and y, and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.

The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine which number is smaller and prints them in the correct order. This approach is correct and efficient for the given problem constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing each pair of integers in sorted order.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the program's logic, and the execution summary, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
