The code prints the current values of `x` and `y`, which are integers. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current values of `x` and `y`.

Output: **x (where x is the current value of x) and y (where y is the current value of y)**
