The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`x` and `y` are integers, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first two inputs.**
