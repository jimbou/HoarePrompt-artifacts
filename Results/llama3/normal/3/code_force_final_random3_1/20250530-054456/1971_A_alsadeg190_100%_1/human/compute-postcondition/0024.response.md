Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers, `i` is `x-1`, stdin is empty. If `x` is less than `y`, the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the values of `y` and `x` are printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `x-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The stdin will be empty because all the input lines will have been processed. The values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and they will be printed in either the order `x, y` or `y, x`, depending on their relative values.
