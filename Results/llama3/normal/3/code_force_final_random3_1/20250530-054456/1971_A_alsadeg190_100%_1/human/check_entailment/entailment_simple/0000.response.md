Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. The program first reads an integer t from the input, which represents the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads two space-separated integers x and y.

The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine the minimum and maximum of x and y. If x is less than y, it prints x followed by y. Otherwise, it prints y followed by x.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The use of the if-else statement ensures that the minimum value is always printed first, followed by the maximum value.

Correctness: **True**
