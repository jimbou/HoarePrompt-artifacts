Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three space-separated integers: k, x, and a. k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, and stdin contains one less test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, or if `x` is not equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 3, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `x + 1` if `k` is 2, otherwise `z` is `(x + 1) * `z // (k - 1) + (x + 1)`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
