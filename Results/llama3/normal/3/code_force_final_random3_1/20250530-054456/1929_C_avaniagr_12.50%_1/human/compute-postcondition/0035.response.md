Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, `z` is `x + 1`, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z` (which is `x + 1`), the string 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, if `a` is less than `z`, the string 'NO' is being printed.***
