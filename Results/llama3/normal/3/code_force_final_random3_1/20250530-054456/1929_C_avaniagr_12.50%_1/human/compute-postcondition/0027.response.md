Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, `z` is 2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to `2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1`, which is the result of the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `x` and `k` are still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before.
