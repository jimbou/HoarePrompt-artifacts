Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 3, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `x + 1` if `k` is 2, otherwise `z` is `(x + 1) * `z // (k - 1) + (x + 1)`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
