Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 1, `z` is `2 * z // (k - 1) + z + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to `2 * z // (k - 1) + z + 1`, which is the result of the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, and the conditions on `x` and `i` are still valid.
