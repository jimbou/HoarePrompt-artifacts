Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 1, `z` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `z` that is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables and the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remain unchanged.
