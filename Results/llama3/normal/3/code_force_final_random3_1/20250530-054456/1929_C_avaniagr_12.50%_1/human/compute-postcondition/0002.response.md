Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the input operation, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The values of `t` and `_` are not affected.
