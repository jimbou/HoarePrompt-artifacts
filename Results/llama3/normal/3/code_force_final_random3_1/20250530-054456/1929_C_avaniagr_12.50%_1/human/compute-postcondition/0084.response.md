To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(x + 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is at least 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, `z` is 2 if `k` is 2 else `z` is 2 * `z // (k - 1) + 2`, `x` is at least 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
