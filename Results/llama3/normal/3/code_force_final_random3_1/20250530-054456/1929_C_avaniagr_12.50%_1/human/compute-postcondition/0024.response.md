To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, we can conclude that `x` is greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, `z` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to `k`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
