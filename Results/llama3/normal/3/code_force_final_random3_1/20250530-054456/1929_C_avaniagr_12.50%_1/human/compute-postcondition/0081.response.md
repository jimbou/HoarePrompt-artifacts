Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, `z` is 1 if `k` is 2 else `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`, `x` is at least 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 2, then `z` is 1; otherwise, `z` is the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
