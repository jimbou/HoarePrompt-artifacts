Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, `z` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 1, as it was initially 0 and the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` evaluates to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `x` and `k` are still valid. The stdin now contains one less test case.
