To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x + 1` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `x` must remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 1, `z` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1**
