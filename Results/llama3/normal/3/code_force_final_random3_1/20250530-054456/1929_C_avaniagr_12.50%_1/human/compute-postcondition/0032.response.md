Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, `z` is `x + 1`, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and `a` is less than `z`***
