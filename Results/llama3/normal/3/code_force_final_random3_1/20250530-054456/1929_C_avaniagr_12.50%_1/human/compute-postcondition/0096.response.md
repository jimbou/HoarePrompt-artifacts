Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the last three inputs from the stdin, `_` is `t`, stdin contains no test cases. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, or if `x` is not equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The value of `t` is now 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are the last inputs read from the stdin. The loop variable `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The stdin now contains no test cases, as all test cases have been processed. The output state also describes the conditions under which 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, based on the values of `x`, `k`, and `a`.
