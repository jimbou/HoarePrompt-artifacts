Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.***
