Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three space-separated integers: k, x, and a. k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, and stdin contains one less test case.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first test case, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, since the first test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are still valid and are waiting to be read in the next test case.
