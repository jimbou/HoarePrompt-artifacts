Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, `z` is 3 if `k` is 2 else `z` is 3 * `z // (k - 1) + 3`, `x` is at least 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated based on the initial value of `z` and the value of `k`. If `k` is 2, `z` is now 3; otherwise, `z` is now 3 times the initial value of `z` divided by `k-1`, plus 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
