Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, `z` is `x + 1`, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged, `z` becomes `x + 1`, `x` is still greater than or equal to `k - 1` but not equal to `k - 1`, and `i` becomes `x`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1.
