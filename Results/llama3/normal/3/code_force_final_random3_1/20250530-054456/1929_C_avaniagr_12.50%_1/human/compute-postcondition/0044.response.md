Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, or if `x` is not equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
