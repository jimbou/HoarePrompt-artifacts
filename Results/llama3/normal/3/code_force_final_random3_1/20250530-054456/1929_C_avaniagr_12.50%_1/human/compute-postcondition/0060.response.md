Output: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 1, `z` is `x * (z // (k - 1) + 1) + z`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x`. The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, and 'YES' is printed**
