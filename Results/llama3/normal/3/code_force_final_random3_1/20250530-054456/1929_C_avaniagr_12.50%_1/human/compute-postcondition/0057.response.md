Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 1, `z` is `x * (z // (k - 1) + 1) + z`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `z` and `i`. The value of `z` is updated to `x * (z // (k - 1) + 1) + z`, which represents the total number of times the loop body is executed. The value of `i` is updated to `x`, which represents the number of iterations the loop has executed.
