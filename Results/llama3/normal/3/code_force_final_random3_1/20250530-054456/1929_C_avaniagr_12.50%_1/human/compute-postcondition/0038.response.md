The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `_` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
