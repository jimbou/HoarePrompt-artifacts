Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 1, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first three inputs have already been read into `k`, `x`, and `a`. The value of `z` is now dependent on the value of `k`, and its new value is a result of the arithmetic operation performed on its original value.
