Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `_` is 0, `z` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as integers. The variable `_` is still 0. A new variable `z` is introduced and assigned the value 0. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been processed. The conditions `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1` are still valid.
