Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, `z` is `x + 1` if `k` is 2 else `z` is `(x + 1) * `z // (k - 1) + (x + 1)`, `x` is at least 0, `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
