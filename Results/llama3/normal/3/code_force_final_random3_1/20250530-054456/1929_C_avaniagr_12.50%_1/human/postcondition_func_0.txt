This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It then checks the conditions for each test case and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following rules: if x is less than k-1, it prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to x+1; if x is equal to k-1, it prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to x+3; if x is greater than k-1, it calculates a value z and prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to z. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
