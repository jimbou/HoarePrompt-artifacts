Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy to determine if Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

The program first checks if x is less than k - 1. If this is the case, Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants if he has at least x + 1 coins initially. This is because he can place a bet of 1 coin and win, then place a bet of 2 coins and win, and so on, until he has enough coins.

If x is equal to k - 1, Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants if he has at least x + 3 coins initially. This is because he can place a bet of 1 coin and win, then place a bet of 2 coins and win, then place a bet of 3 coins and win, and so on, until he has enough coins.

If x is greater than k - 1, Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants if he has at least z coins initially, where z is calculated by the formula z = z // (k - 1) + 1, starting from z = 0 and repeating the calculation x + 1 times. This is because Sasha can place a bet of z // (k - 1) + 1 coins and win, then place a bet of z // (k - 1) + 1 coins and win, and so on, until he has enough coins.

The program correctly implements these strategies and prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
