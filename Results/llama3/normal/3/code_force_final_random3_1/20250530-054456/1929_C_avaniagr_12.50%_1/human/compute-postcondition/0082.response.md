To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is at least 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, `z` is 1 if `k` is 2 else `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`, `x` is at least 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
