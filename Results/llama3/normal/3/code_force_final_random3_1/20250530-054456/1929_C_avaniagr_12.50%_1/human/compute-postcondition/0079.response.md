Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, `z` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
