Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the first three inputs from the stdin, `_` is 2, `z` is 2 if `k` is 2 else `z` is 2 * `z // (k - 1) + 2`, `x` is at least 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated based on the initial value of `z` and the value of `k`. If `k` is 2, then `z` is now 2. If `k` is not 2, then `z` is now 2 times the initial value of `z` divided by `k-1`, plus 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
