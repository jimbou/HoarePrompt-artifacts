Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program checks the conditions for each test case and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the rules provided.

The program correctly handles the three cases:

1.  When x is less than k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+1.
2.  When x is equal to k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+3.
3.  When x is greater than k-1, it calculates a value z and checks if a is greater than or equal to z.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
