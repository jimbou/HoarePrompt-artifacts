Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string 'NO'.

The variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `_` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

The print statement simply prints the string 'NO', without any variables or expressions being evaluated.

Output: **NO**
