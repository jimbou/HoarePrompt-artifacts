Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining if a rectangle of size a x b can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, and then forming another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

The given program checks if either a or b is even. If either a or b is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If both a and b are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that another rectangle cannot be formed.

This solution is correct because if either a or b is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to the side with the even length. For example, if a is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size a/2 x b. These two rectangles can then be used to form another rectangle of size a x b/2, which is different from the original rectangle.

On the other hand, if both a and b are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. This is because any cut would result in two rectangles with non-integer sides, which cannot be used to form another rectangle.

Therefore, the given program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
