Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If either `a` or `b` is even, 'Yes' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two integers read from the first line of input from stdin. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b`. The conditions for printing 'Yes' or 'No' remain the same, depending on whether either `a` or `b` is even or both are odd.
