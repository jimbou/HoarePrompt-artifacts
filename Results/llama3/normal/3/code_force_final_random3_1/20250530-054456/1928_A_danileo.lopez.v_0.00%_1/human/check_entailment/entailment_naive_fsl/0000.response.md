Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 2 2, the program prints 'Yes', but according to the problem description, the 2 x 2 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, and then forming another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. Therefore, the correct output should be 'No'.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if either a or b is even, but it does not consider the case where both a and b are even. In this case, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, but it is not possible to form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.
