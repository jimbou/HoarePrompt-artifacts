Reasoning:

The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The key insight is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can cut it into two rectangles and then form another rectangle by combining them. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

The program correctly checks if either dimension is even using the modulo operator (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`). If either condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form another rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No'.

The program also correctly handles the case where the first test case has both odd dimensions, as it will print 'No' for that case.

Correctness: **True**
