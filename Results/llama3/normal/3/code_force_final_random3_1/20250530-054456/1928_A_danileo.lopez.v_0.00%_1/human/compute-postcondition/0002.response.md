Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two integers read from the first line of input. The value of `t` remains the same, and the value of `_` is still 0. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), since one line of input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
