Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b`, because one line of input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
