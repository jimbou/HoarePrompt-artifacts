The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If either `a` or `b` is even, 'Yes' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.**
