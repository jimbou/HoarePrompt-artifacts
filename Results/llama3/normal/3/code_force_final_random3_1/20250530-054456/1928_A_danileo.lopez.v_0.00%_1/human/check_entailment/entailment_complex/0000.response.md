Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if either of the dimensions (a or b) is even, and if so, it prints 'Yes'. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No'. This logic is correct based on the problem description.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases (t) and then reads the dimensions of each rectangle. It prints the result for each test case.

The state of the program before and after the function call is also correct. The program reads the input from stdin and prints the output to stdout.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
