The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). This integer is assigned to `t`. The remaining lines in the stdin contain two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) for each of the `t` test cases. Since one line has been read, there are now `t-1` lines remaining in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
