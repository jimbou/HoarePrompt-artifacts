Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `_` is `t-1`, stdin contains no lines of input. If either `a` or `b` is even, 'Yes' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed, and then 'Yes' is printed `t-1` times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are still integers between 1 and 10^9, and `_` is now `t-1`. The stdin contains no lines of input because all the input lines have been processed. The output will be 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' followed by 'Yes' printed `t-1` times if both `a` and `b` are odd.
