Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current values of `a` and `b` are such that at least one of them is even (i.e., `a` is even or `b` is even), and 'Yes' is being printed**
