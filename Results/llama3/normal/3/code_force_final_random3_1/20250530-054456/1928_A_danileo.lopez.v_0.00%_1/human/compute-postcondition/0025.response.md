Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains two integers (a and b) representing the size of a rectangle. It then checks each rectangle's dimensions and prints 'Yes' if either dimension is even, and 'No' if both dimensions are odd. The function repeats this process for all test cases, printing 'Yes' for the remaining cases if the first case has both odd dimensions.**
