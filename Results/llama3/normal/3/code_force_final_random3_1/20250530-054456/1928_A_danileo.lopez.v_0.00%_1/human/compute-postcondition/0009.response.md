Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If either `a` or `b` is even, 'Yes' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.***
