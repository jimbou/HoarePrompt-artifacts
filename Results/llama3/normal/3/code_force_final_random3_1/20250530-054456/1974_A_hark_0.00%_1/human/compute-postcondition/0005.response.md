The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` must be increased by 1. So `_` is 2.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 2, and a value has been returned from the function `func_2()`**
