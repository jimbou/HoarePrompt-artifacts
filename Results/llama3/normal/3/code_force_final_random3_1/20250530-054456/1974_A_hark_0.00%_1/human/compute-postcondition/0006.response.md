Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 2, and a value has been returned from the function `func_2()`**

The code snippet `func_2()` is a function call, and since a value has already been returned from this function in the initial state, the output state remains the same. The values of the variables `t`, stdin, and `_` are not affected by this function call, so they retain their initial values. The function call does not modify any variables or stdin, and since a value has already been returned, there is no new return value.
