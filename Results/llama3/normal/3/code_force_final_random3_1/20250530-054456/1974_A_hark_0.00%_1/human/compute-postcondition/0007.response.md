Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is `t-1`, and a value has been returned from the function `func_2()`**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. After the loop finishes, the variable `_` will have a value of `t-1`, indicating that it has iterated `t` times. Additionally, the function `func_2()` has returned a value `t` times. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
