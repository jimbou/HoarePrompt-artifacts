Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 0, and a value has been returned from the function `func_2()`**

In this output state, the values of `t`, stdin, and `_` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. However, the code calls the function `func_2()`, which means that this function has been executed and a value has been returned from it. The returned value is not specified in the initial state, so it is included in the output state as a returned value from the function `func_2()`.
