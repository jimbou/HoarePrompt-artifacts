Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 1, and a value has been returned from the function `func_2()`**

The code snippet simply calls the function `func_2()` without assigning its return value to any variable. Since the return value is not used, the state of the variables does not change. The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 0, stdin remains empty, and the value of `_` remains 1. Additionally, a value has been returned from the function `func_2()`, but its value is not stored or used anywhere.
