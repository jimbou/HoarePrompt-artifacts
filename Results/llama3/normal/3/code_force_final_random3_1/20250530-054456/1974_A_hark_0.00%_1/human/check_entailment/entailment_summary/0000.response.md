Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop, where each screen is a 5x3 grid. The icons can be either 1x1 or 2x2 cells in size.

Function 1 is not directly relevant to the problem, as it simply compares two integers and returns the smaller one.

Function 2 is the core of the solution. It reads two integers x and y from standard input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It then performs calculations to determine the minimum number of screens needed. The calculations involve dividing y by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells), subtracting the result from x, and then dividing the result by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells). The function also handles edge cases where x or y is 0.

Function 3 is the main function that reads the number of test cases from standard input and calls Function 2 for each test case.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that Function 2 correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case, and Function 3 correctly executes Function 2 for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
