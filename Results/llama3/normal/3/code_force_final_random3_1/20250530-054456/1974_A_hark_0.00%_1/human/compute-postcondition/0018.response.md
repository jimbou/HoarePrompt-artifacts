Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin is empty. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is printed. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0, then either the ceiling of half of `y` is printed if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, or 0 is printed if both `x` and `y` are 0.**
