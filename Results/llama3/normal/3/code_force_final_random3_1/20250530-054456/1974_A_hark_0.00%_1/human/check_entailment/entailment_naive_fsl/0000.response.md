Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when x = 13 and y = 1, the program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. This is because the program is not correctly calculating the number of screens needed when there are remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

The issue lies in the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This line is trying to calculate the remaining number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons, but it is not doing it correctly. The correct calculation should be `x = x - (bxsfory * 4)`, because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 15.

Additionally, the program is not correctly handling the case when x is a multiple of 15 and y is 0. In this case, the program will output 1, but the correct answer is 0. This is because the program is not checking if x is a multiple of 15 before calculating the number of screens needed.

Overall, the program is not correctly implementing the logic to calculate the minimum number of screens needed, and therefore, it is incorrect.
