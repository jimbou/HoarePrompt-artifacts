To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0.

Since `_` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the new value of `_` will be 1.

The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The state of `stdin` and the return value from the function `func_2()` are not relevant to the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 1, and a value has been returned from the function `func_2()`**
