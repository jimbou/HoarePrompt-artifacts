Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons of different sizes (1x1 and 2x2) on a desktop with a grid size of 5x3. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` is not relevant to the problem, as it simply compares two integers and returns the smaller one.

`func_2` reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` from standard input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It then performs calculations based on the values of `x` and `y` and prints the result. The calculations seem to be correct, as they take into account the size of the icons and the grid size.

`func_3` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and calls `func_2` for each test case.

The program's logic seems to be correct, as it reads the input values, performs the necessary calculations, and prints the result for each test case. The calculations in `func_2` appear to be accurate, and the program handles different scenarios correctly (e.g., when `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, or when `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0).

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
