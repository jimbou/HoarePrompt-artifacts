This function reads two space-separated integers x and y from standard input, where 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. It then performs calculations based on the values of x and y and prints the result. If both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates and prints the sum of two values: bxsfory (the ceiling of y/2) and bxsfory1 (the ceiling of x/15 plus 1, or 0 if x is less than or equal to 0). If either x is 0 or y is 0 (or both), it prints the ceiling of y/2 if x is 0 and y is greater than 0, the ceiling of x/15 if x is greater than 0 and y is 0, or 0 if both x and y are 0.
