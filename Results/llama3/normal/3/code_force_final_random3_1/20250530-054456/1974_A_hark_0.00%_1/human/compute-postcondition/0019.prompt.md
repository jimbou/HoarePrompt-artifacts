You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: two space-separated integers x and y such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99.
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 and bxsfory are integers)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: The ceiling of y/2 (where y is an integer between 0 and 99 and is currently greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: the ceiling of the division of x by 15 (where x is an integer between 1 and 99)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin is empty. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.
        #State: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin is empty. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of half of `y` is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.
    #State: `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin is empty. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is printed. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0, then either the ceiling of half of `y` is printed if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, or 0 is printed if both `x` and `y` are 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: x is an integer, y is an integer between 1 and 99, bxsfory is an integer, bxsfory1 is an integer, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed

Case_2: `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin is empty. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Also, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, and 0 is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
