The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains one input: an integer (t) that represents the number of test cases, the value of `t` is now equal to that integer. The stdin is now empty since the input has been consumed. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin is empty**
