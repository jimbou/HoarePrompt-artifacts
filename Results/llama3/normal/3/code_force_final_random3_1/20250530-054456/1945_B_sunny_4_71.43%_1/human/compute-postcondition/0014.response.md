Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers a, b, and m. For each case, it calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to m/a and m/b, adds these two values together, and prints the result. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point the input is exhausted.**
