Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), adding 1 to each result, and then summing these two values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the frequency of launching for the first installation (a), the second installation (b), and the time the firework is visible in the sky (m).

3. It calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation (A) by dividing m by a and adding 1. This is because the first firework from the first installation will be visible for m minutes, and the next firework from the same installation will be launched after a minutes. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks from the first installation that can be seen at the same time is the integer part of m/a plus 1.

4. Similarly, it calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the second installation (B) by dividing m by b and adding 1.

5. Finally, it prints the sum of A and B, which represents the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation and sums them up to find the total maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
