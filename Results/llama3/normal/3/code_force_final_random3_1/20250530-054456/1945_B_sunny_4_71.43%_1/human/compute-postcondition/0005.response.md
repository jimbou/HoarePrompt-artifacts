The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is greater than 1, _ is any value, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer, b is an integer, m is an integer, A is an integer equal to (m/a)+1, B is an integer equal to (m/b)+1, and the sum of A and B is printed which is equal to ((m/a)+1) + ((m/b)+1)**
