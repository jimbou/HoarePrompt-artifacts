Output State: **t is greater than 2, _ is any value, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer equal to the first value of the first line of stdin, b is an integer equal to the second value of the first line of stdin, m is an integer equal to the third value of the first line of stdin, A is an integer equal to ((m/a)+1), B is an integer equal to ((m/b)+1).**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains greater than 2, and the value of `_` remains unchanged. The `stdin` now contains `t-4` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, within the specified range. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the first, second, and third values of the first line of `stdin`, respectively. The values of `A` and `B` are calculated based on the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, and are equal to `((m/a)+1)` and `((m/b)+1)`, respectively.
