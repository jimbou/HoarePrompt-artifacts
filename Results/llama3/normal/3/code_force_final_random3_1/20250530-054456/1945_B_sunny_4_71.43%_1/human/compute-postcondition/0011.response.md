The code prints the sum of A and B. Where A is an integer equal to ((m/a)+1) and B is an integer equal to ((m/b)+1). m is an integer equal to the third value of the first line of stdin, a is an integer equal to the first value of the first line of stdin, and b is an integer equal to the second value of the first line of stdin.
Output: **((m/a)+1) + ((m/b)+1) (where m is the third value of the first line of stdin, a is the first value of the first line of stdin, and b is the second value of the first line of stdin)**
