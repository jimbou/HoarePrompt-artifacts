Reasoning:

The program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The key insight is that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation within the time frame m.

The program calculates this by dividing m by a and b, rounding up to the nearest integer (using the int(m / a) + 1 and int(m / b) + 1 expressions), and adding the results together. This is a correct and efficient way to solve the problem.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example inputs and outputs are consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
