According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so it can be adjusted to any value. 

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is any value, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
