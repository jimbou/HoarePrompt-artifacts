The code reads an integer t from stdin, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers p_i from stdin. It then calculates the sum of 3 times the integer division of each p_i by 2, plus the remainder of p_i divided by 2 if the index i is less than 3. This sum is then divided by 3 and converted to a string. The results for all test cases are joined with newline characters and printed.

Output: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: the sum of 3 times the integer division of each p_i by 2, plus the remainder of p_i divided by 2 if the index i is less than 3, divided by 3, for each test case, joined with newline characters**
