Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice. The issue lies in the calculation `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3`. This calculation does not take into account the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers.

A counterexample is the input `2 2 2 0`. The program outputs `4`, but the correct answer is `3`. The optimal strategy for Eve is to remove two 1's, two 2's, and two 3's, resulting in Bob winning 3 times.

The correct approach would be to use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win, taking into account the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers.
