Let's break down the code step by step to understand what will be printed.

1. `int(input())`: This reads an integer from the standard input, which is the value of `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). Let's call this value `t`.

2. The code then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it reads a line from the standard input, which contains four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200). These integers are split into a list using `input().split()` and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Let's call this list `p`.

3. The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is calculated for each `x` in `p` and the results are summed up. Here, `x // 2` is the integer division of `x` by 2, `x % 2` is the remainder of `x` divided by 2, and `i < 3` is a boolean value that is `True` if `i` is less than 3 and `False` otherwise.

   - If `x` is even, `x // 2` is the integer part of `x` divided by 2, and `x % 2` is 0. So the expression simplifies to `3 * (x // 2)`.
   - If `x` is odd, `x // 2` is the integer part of `x` divided by 2, and `x % 2` is 1. So the expression simplifies to `3 * (x // 2) + (i < 3)`.

4. The sum of these expressions is then divided by 3 using `// 3`.

5. The result of this division is converted to a string using `str(...)`.

6. The `join` method is used to concatenate these strings with newline characters (`\n`) in between.

So, the output will be a string containing `t` lines, where each line is the result of the calculation for the corresponding input line.

Output: **The results of the calculation for each input line, one per line**
