Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of the input.
2. For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` from the input line, representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
3. The program calculates a value for each integer `x` in the input line using the formula `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`. This formula is based on the observation that:
	* For each pair of identical numbers (ones, twos, threes, or fours), Bob can win once by removing one of them.
	* For each single number (not part of a pair), Bob can win once if it's a one, two, or three (but not a four).
4. The program sums up the calculated values for each integer in the input line and divides the result by 3. This is because Bob can win at most once for every three numbers removed by Eve.
5. The program prints the result of the calculation for each input line, one result per line.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
