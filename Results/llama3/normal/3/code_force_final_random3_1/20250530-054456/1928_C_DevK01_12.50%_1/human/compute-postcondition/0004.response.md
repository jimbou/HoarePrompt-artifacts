To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `int(w // 1)`. If `w` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty.

State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q, `i` is 1, M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is an empty list**
