Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, w is a float equal to the square root of q. If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q, `i` is 1. M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i if q is divisible by i, otherwise M is an empty list. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1. If `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q. M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i if q is divisible by i, otherwise M is an empty list. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1. If `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then the value of `i` which is 2 is also appended to M. Additionally, if `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q. M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i if q is divisible by i, otherwise M is an empty list. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then the value of `i` which is 3 is also appended to M. Additionally, if `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M. And finally, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `i` is appended to M. Also, if `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M. If `q` is not divisible by `i`, then M remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
