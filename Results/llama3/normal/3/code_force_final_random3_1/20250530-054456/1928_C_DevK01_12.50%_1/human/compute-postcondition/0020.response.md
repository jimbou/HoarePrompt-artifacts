Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q. M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i if q is divisible by i, otherwise M is an empty list. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then the value of `i` which is 3 is also appended to M. Additionally, if `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M. And finally, `i` is appended to M.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `i` is now appended to the list M. This means that M now contains all the previous values it had, plus the value of `i`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `w` remain unchanged.
