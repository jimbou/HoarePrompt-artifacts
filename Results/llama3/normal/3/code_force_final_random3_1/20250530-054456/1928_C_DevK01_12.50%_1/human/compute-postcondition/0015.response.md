Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q. M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i if q is divisible by i, otherwise M is an empty list. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1. If `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the value of `i` which is 2 is also appended to M.***
