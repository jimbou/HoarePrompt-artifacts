#State of the program right berfore the function call: q and x are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9.
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: *q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, w is a float equal to the square root of q. If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:

    #State: q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, w is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q. M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i if q is divisible by i, otherwise M is an empty list. If i is greater than or equal to x - 1, then the current value of i is greater than or equal to x. If q divided by i is greater than or equal to x - 1, then q divided by i is appended to M. If q is divisible by i, then the value of i which is equal to the last value of i in the range from 1 to int(w // 1) is also appended to M. Additionally, if q divided by i is greater than or equal to x - 1, then q divided by i is appended to M. And finally, if i is greater than or equal to x - 1, then i is appended to M. Also, if q divided by i is greater than or equal to x - 1, then q divided by i is appended to M. If q is not divisible by i, then M remains unchanged.
    return M
    #The program returns list M, which contains integers that are either the square root of q (if it's an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1), or values of i (if q is divisible by i and i is greater than or equal to x - 1), or q divided by i (if q is divisible by i and q divided by i is greater than or equal to x - 1).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, q and x, as input and returns a list of integers, M. The list M contains the square root of q if it is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1. Otherwise, M contains the divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1. The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of q, checks if q is divisible by each number, and appends the divisor and the quotient to the list M if they meet the condition. The function returns the list M, which contains all the divisors and the square root of q that meet the specified conditions.
