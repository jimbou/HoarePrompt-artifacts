Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q, `i` is 1, M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i and q // i. The current value of `q` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1. The current value of `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `q`, `x`, `w`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `M` now contains an additional element, which is the integer value of `q` divided by `i`. The divisibility of `q` by `i` and the relationship between `i` and `x` - 1 are still valid.
