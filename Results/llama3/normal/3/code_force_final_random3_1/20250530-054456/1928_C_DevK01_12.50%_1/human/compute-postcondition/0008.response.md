Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q, `i` is 1, M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i. The current value of `q` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1.***
