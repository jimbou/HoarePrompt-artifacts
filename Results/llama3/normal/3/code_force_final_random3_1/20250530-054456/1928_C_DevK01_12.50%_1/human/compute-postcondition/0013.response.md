To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `w`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of `q`.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `w` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `q`, `x`, and `M`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `w` is a float greater than 1 and equal to the square root of q, `i` is 2. M is a list containing the integer value of the square root of q if the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, otherwise M is a list containing the integer value of i if q is divisible by i, otherwise M is an empty list. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1. If `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `q` divided by `i` is appended to M.**
