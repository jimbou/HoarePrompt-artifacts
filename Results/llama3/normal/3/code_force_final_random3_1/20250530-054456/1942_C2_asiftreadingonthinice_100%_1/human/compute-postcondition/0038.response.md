Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect their values. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
