Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, stdin contains `tt-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` that are even, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of `a` is 2, `y` is an integer, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is added to `tmp`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, and the conditions and relationships between them are still valid. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
