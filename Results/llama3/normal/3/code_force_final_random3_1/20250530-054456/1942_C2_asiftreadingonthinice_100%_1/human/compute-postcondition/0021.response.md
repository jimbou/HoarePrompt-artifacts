Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is equal to x, ans is an integer equal to x + y plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a that have a difference of 2, tmp is a list containing the integer division of the differences between adjacent elements in a that are even but not 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

*   The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
*   The list `a` remains a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
*   The loop counter `i` is equal to `x`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `a`.
*   The value of `ans` is increased by the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` that have a difference of 2.
*   The list `tmp` contains the integer division of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not 2.
