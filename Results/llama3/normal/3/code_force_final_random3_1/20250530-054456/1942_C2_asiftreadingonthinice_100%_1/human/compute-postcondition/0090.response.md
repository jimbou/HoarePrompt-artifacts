Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to the third element in the list `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all `j` in range(1, `x`) where the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is even and must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`), `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the program is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
