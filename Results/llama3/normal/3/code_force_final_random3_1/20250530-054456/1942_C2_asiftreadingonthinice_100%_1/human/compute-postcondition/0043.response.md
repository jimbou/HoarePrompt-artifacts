Postcondition: ***`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 3 elements. If `y` is greater than or equal to the third element in `tmp` minus 1, `ans` is increased by the third element in `tmp` and `y` is decreased by the third element in `tmp` minus 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
