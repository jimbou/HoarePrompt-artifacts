Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is equal to the last element in the list tmp, tmp is an empty list, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, y is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, `stdin` contains `tt-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to the last element in the list `tmp`, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` if the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is not 2, or `x + y - 1` if the difference is 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, `stdin` contains `tt-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 3 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to the second element in the list `a`, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` if the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is not 2, or `x + y - 1` if the difference is 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, `stdin` contains `tt-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 3 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` if the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is 2, or `x + y - 2` if the difference is not 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
