Postcondition: **The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i + 1`. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `i - 1`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is either equal to 2 or even, and if it is even, the half of the sum is added to `tmp`.**
