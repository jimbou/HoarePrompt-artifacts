Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the given code. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out.

The program first calculates the initial number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices, and then it tries to add more triangles by choosing additional vertices. It uses a greedy approach to choose the additional vertices, which is correct because the problem allows for non-intersecting diagonals.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the chosen vertices are consecutive or when the remaining vertices are not enough to form a triangle.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
