Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 3 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing the integer ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2).**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to include the integer ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2), which is the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`, divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
