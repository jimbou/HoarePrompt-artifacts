Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 4 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing the value ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2) if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is even, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`. If the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is 2, the minimum value between `ans + 1` and `n - 2` is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum value between `ans + 1` and `n - 2` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is now either `x + y - 1` or `x + y`, depending on whether the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is not 2 or 2, respectively. The minimum value between `ans + 1` and `n - 2` is being printed, regardless of whether the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is 2 or not.
