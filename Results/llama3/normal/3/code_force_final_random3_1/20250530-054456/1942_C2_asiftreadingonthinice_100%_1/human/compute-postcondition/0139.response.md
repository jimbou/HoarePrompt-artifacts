Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, tmp is a sorted list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2 plus the sum of all elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1, y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1 minus 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be increased by the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the value of `y` will be decreased by the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus 1. The loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement when `y` is less than `i - 1`. The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. The sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is either equal to 2 or even, and if it is even, the half of the sum is added to `tmp`.
