Postcondition: ***`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1. The difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not equal to 2. The current value of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even.***
