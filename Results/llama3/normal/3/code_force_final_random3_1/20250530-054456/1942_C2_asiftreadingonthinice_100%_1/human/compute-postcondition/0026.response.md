Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is equal to x, `ans` is an integer equal to x + y plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a that have a difference of 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer division of the differences between adjacent elements in a that are even but not 2 and the integer division of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a which is even.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `tmp` now contains an additional element, which is the integer division of the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a`, which is even.
