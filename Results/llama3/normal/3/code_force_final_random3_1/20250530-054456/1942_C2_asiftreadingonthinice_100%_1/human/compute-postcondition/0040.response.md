The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `tmp`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tmp`.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `tmp` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in the list.
State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is the third element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 3 elements.**
