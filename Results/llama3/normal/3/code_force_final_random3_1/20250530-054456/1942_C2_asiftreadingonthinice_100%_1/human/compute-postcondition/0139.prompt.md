Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is equal to the last element in the list a, `tmp` is a sorted list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even, `ans` is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, tmp is a sorted list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even and is not empty, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2, y is an integer, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp. If y is greater than or equal to i - 1, then ans is increased by i and y is decreased by i + 1. Otherwise, if y is less than i - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, tmp is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even, i is the second element in tmp, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2 plus i if y >= i - 1, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2, y is an integer less than i - 1 if y >= i - 1, otherwise y is an integer, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp. If y is greater than or equal to i - 1, then ans is increased by i and y is decreased by i + 1. Otherwise, if y is less than i - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i + 1`. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `i - 1`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is either equal to 2 or even, and if it is even, the half of the sum is added to `tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
