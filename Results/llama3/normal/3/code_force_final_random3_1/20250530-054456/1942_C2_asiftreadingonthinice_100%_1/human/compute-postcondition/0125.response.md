The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `tmp`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tmp`. If `tmp` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is equal to the last element in the list a, `tmp` is a sorted list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even, `ans` is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp. So for the loop to be executed  the list tmp must not be empty and i is the first element in the list tmp.
State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is the first element in the list tmp, `tmp` is a sorted list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even and is not empty, `ans` is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp.**
