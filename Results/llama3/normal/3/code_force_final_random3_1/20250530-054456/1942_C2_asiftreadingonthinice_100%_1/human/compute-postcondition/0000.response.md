Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y, such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `tt` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 4 and 10^9. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two lines as described in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected.
