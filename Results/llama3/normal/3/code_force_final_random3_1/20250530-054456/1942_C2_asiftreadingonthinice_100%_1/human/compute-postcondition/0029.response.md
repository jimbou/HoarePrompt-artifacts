Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is equal to x. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to x + y plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a that have a difference of 2 plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to x + y plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a that have a difference of 2. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer division of the differences between adjacent elements in a that are even but not 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even, `tmp` also contains the integer division of this sum. Otherwise, `tmp` does not contain this sum.**

The code sorts the list `tmp` in ascending order. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `tmp` now contains the same elements as before, but in sorted order.
