Postcondition: ***tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is equal to x, ans is an integer equal to x + y plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a that have a difference of 2, tmp is a list containing the integer division of the differences between adjacent elements in a that are even but not 2. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, tmp also contains the integer division of this sum. Otherwise, tmp does not contain this sum.***
