Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, tmp is a sorted list that must have at least 3 elements, ans is increased by the third element in tmp, y is decreased by the third element in tmp minus 1.**

In this output state, the values of tt, ii, stdin, n, x, and a remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of tmp also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. However, the value of ans is increased by the third element in tmp, and the value of y is decreased by the third element in tmp minus 1.
