To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `tmp` and `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tmp`. If `tmp` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer division of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not 2, and possibly the integer division of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` if it is even, we need to adjust the state of `tmp` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is equal to x, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `tmp`**
