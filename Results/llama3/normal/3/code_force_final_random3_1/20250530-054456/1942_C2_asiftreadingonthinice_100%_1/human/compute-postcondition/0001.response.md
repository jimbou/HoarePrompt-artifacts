The only variables in the loop head are variables `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, which ensures that the loop will execute, so `tt` does not need to be adjusted. However, `ii` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains `tt`-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y, such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
