Postcondition: ***`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2`. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the value of (a[1] - a[0]) // 2. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the value of (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list and `i` is 2.***
