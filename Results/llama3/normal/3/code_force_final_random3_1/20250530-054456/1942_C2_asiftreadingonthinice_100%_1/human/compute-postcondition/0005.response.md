Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n` where the difference between the second element and the first element is 2, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list, and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `x + y - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
