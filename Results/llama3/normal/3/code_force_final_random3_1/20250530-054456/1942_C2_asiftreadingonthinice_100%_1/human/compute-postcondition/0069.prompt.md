Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 1, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is equal to the last element in tmp, tmp is an empty list, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1 minus the number of elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `tmp` is a list containing the value ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2) if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is even, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 3 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2) if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is even, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`. If the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is 2, the minimum value between `ans + 1` and `n - 2` is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 4 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing the value ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2) if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is even, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`. The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i - 1` in list `a` is not 2, otherwise the minimum value between `ans + 1` and `n - 2` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
