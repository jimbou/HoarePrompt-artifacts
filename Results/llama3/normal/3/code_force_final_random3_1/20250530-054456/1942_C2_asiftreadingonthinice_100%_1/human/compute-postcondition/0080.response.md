Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 1, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is equal to x - 1, tmp is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all j in range(1, x) where the difference between the elements at index j and j - 1 in list a is even and must have at least 1 element, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index j and j - 1 in list a is 2 for all j in range(1, x), y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1 minus the number of elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is equal to 2, then the current value of a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] equals 2 and ans is an integer equal to x + y - 1 plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index j and j - 1 in list a is 2 for all j in range(1, x). If the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is not equal to 2, then the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is not equal to 2 and if the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is even, the value ((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2) is added to tmp, i is the first element in the list tmp. The current value of y is greater than or equal to i - 1, ans is increased by i, and y is decreased by i - 1.**
