Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value of (a[1] - a[0]) // 2, `i` is 1. The difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is not equal to 2.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to include the value of `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, which is the integer division of the difference between the first two elements of `a` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
