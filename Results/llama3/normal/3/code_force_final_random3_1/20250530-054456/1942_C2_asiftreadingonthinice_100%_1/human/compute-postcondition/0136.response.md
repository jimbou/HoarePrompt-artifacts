Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, tmp is a sorted list containing at least 1 elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even, i is the first element in tmp, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2 plus i, y is an integer less than i - 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp.**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `ans` and `y`. The value of `ans` has been increased by `i`, and the value of `y` has been decreased by `i - 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is still being printed. The conditions regarding the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` also remain the same.
