Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2`, and `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the value of (a[1] - a[0]) // 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y`. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2`. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the value of (a[1] - a[0]) // 2. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the value of (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list and `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 3 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
