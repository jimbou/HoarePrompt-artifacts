To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the list `tmp`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `tmp` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the second element in the list `tmp`, and `tmp` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `tmp` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list `tmp`.

State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to the third element in the list `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all `j` in range(1, `x`) where the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is even and must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`), `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is equal to 2, then the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2 and `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`). If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2, then the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2 and if the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even, the value ((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2) is added to `tmp`, `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. The current value of `y` is either greater than or equal to `i - 1` or less than `i - 1`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
