Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus `i` and `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
