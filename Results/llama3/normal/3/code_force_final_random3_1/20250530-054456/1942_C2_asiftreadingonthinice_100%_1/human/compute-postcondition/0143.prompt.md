Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y, such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
    tmp.sort()
    for i in tmp:
        if y >= i - 1:
            ans += i
            y -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is equal to the last element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` plus `y`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to the last element in the list `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all `j` in range(1, `x`) where the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is even, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`) plus `y`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is equal to 2, then the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2 and `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`). If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2, then the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2 and if the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even, the value ((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2) is added to `tmp`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `tmp` is a sorted list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even, `ans` is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2 plus the sum of all elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1 plus y, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1 minus 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
