Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is the third element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 3 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The program execution is paused at this point, waiting for further instructions.
