Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least 1 elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even, `i` is the first element in tmp, `ans` is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2, `y` is an integer less than i - 1 if y >= i - 1, otherwise y is an integer, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change.
