Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value of (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is even, otherwise `tmp` is a list containing the value of (a[2] - a[1]) // 2, and `i` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: `tt` remains an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` remains 0, `stdin` still contains `tt-2` test cases, `n` remains an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` remains an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` remains an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `a` remains a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` remains an integer equal to `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains an integer equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` now contains the value of (a[2] - a[1]) // 2, and `i` is now 3.
