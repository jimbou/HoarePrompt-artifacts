Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. The current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The minimum value between the updated `ans` and `n - 2` is still being printed.
