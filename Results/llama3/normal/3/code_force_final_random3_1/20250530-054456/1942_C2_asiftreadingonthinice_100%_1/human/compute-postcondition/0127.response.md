Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, tmp is a sorted list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even and is not empty, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2 plus i, y is an integer equal to its original value minus i + 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp. The current value of y is greater than or equal to 0.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `i` and decrements `y` by `i - 1`. Since `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` that are even and is not empty, `i` is a positive integer. Therefore, `ans` increases by a positive integer, and `y` decreases by a positive integer minus one. The value of `y` is now greater than or equal to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
