Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to `x - 1`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all `j` in range(1, `x`) where the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is even, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`), `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is equal to 2, then the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2 and `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`). If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2, then the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2 and if the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even, the value ((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2) is added to `tmp`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to `x - 1`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all `j` in range(1, `x`) where the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is even and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`), `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is equal to 2, then the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2 and `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`). If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2, then the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2 and if the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even, the value ((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2) is added to `tmp`, `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. The current value of `y` is either greater than or equal to `i - 1` or less than `i - 1`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 1, `stdin` contains `tt-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to the second element in the list `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all `j` in range(1, `x`) where the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is even and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`), `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1` minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y + 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is equal to 2, then the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2 and `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is 2 for all `j` in range(1, `x`). If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2, then the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2 and if the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even, the value ((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2) is added to `tmp`, `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. The current value of `y` is either greater than or equal to `i - 1` or less than `i - 1`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program executes the if-else block, and based on the condition `y >= i - 1`, it either increments `ans` by `i` and decreases `y` by `i - 1`, or breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The final state of the program variables is determined by the outcome of this condition, resulting in either an updated `ans` and `y` or an exit from the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
