Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 2, stdin contains tt-4 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, tmp is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even, i is the second element in tmp, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2 plus i, y is an integer less than i - 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2, then the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is equal to 2. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is even, then the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is added to tmp.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `i` and decrements `y` by `i - 1`. This means that `ans` is increased by the second element in `tmp`, and `y` is decreased by the second element in `tmp` minus one. The value of `y` is now less than `i - 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
