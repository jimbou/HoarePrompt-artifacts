Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 2, `stdin` contains `tt-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of at least 3 distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is equal to the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` if the difference is even, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` if the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is not 2, or `x + y - 1` if the difference is 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed.**
