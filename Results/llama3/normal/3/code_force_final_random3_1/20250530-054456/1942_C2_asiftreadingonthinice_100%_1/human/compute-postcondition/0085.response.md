Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 1, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is equal to the second element in the list tmp, tmp is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all j in range(1, x) where the difference between the elements at index j and j - 1 in list a is even and must have at least 2 elements, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index j and j - 1 in list a is 2 for all j in range(1, x), y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1 minus the number of elements in tmp that are less than or equal to y + 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is equal to 2, then the current value of a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] equals 2 and ans is an integer equal to x + y - 1 plus the number of times the difference between the elements at index j and j - 1 in list a is 2 for all j in range(1, x). If the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is not equal to 2, then the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is not equal to 2 and if the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is even, the value ((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2) is added to tmp, i is the first element in the list tmp. The current value of y is either greater than or equal to i - 1 or less than i - 1. If y is greater than or equal to i - 1, ans is increased by i, and y is decreased by i - 1. If y is less than i - 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `y`. The value of `ans` is increased by `i`, and the value of `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. The value of `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. The value of `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values ((a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2) for all `j` in range(1, `x`) where the difference between the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in list `a` is even and must have at least 2 elements. The value of `y` is either greater than or equal to `i - 1` or less than `i - 1`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
