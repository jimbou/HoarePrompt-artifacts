Output State: **tt is an integer between 4 and 10^9, ii is 2, stdin contains tt-5 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is equal to the last element in the list a, tmp is a list containing elements which are half of the differences between consecutive elements of a that are even and the half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of a is 2, y is an integer equal to its original value, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list tmp now contains an additional element which is half of the sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a, and the stdin now contains tt-5 test cases instead of tt-4.
