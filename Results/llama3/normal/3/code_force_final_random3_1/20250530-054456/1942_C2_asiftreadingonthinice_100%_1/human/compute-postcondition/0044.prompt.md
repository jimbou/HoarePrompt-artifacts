Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is equal to x. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to x + y plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a that have a difference of 2 plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to x + y plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a that have a difference of 2. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer division of the differences between adjacent elements in a that are even but not 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even, `tmp` also contains the integer division of this sum. Otherwise, `tmp` does not contain this sum.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is equal to x, `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus i if y is greater than or equal to i - 1, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus `i` and `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `ii` is 0, stdin contains tt-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `a` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least 3 elements. If `y` is greater than or equal to the third element in `tmp` minus 1, `ans` is increased by the third element in `tmp` and `y` is decreased by the third element in `tmp` minus 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
