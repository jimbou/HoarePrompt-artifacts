Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, if `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 2, otherwise `count_a` is 1. In all cases, `count_b` is 2 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, otherwise `count_b` is 1, `d` is `k // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `count_b` has been incremented by 1. This means that if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_b` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
