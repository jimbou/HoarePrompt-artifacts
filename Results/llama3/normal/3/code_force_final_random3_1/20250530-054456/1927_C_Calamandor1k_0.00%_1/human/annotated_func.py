#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be equal to 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is equal to t, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 1, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 1, i is equal to the maximum of len_a and len_b, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k, d is k // 2, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k // 2 is at least k // 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether the number of elements in two lists (a and b) that are less than or equal to a given threshold (k // 2) is at least k // 2. The function processes t test cases, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For each test case, it reads three integers (n, m, and k) and two lists of integers (a and b). It then counts the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k and prints 'YES' if both counts are at least k // 2, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
