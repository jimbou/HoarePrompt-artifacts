Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 1, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 1, i is equal to the maximum of len_a and len_b, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k, d is k // 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
    if len_a > i + 1:
        if a[i] <= k:
            count_a += 1
    if len_b > i + 1:
        if b[i] <= k:
            count_b += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 1, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 1, i is 0, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus one if a[i] is less than or equal to k and len_a is greater than i + 1, otherwise count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus one if b[i] is less than or equal to k and len_b is greater than i + 1, otherwise count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k, d is k // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 1, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 1, i is 1. If len_a is greater than i + 1, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus two if a[i] is less than or equal to k, otherwise count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus one. If len_a is not greater than i + 1, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus one if a[i] is less than or equal to k, otherwise count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k. If len_b is greater than i + 1, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus two if b[i] is less than or equal to k, otherwise count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus one. Otherwise, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k. d is k // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 2, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 2, i is 2. If len_a is greater than i + 1, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus two if a[i] is less than or equal to k, otherwise count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus one. If len_a is not greater than i + 1, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus one if a[i] is less than or equal to k, otherwise count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k. If len_b is greater than i + 1, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus two if b[i] is less than or equal to k, otherwise count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus one. Otherwise, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k. d is k // 2. If len_a is greater than i + 1 and a[i] is less than or equal to k, count_a is increased by 1. If len_b is greater than i + 1 and b[i] is less than or equal to k, count_b is increased by 1. Otherwise, count_b remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
