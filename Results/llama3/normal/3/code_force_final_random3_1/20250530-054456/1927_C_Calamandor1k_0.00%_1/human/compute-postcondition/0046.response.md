Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `count_a` is 2 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` is 1, `count_b` is 1 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, otherwise `count_b` is 0, `d` is `k // 2`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count_a` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is now 2; otherwise, it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
