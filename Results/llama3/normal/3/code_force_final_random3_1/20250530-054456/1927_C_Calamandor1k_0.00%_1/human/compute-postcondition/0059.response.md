Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `i` is equal to the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b`, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `d` is `k // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `i` will be equal to the maximum length of lists `a` and `b`, and `count_a` and `count_b` will be the total number of elements in lists `a` and `b` respectively that are less than or equal to `k`. The values of `t`, `stdin`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, and `d` remain unchanged.
