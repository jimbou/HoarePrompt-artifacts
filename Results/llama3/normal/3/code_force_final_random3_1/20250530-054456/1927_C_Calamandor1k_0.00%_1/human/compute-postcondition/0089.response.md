Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 1, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 1, i is equal to the maximum of len_a and len_b, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k, d is k // 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` will be equal to the maximum length of lists `a` and `b`. The variables `count_a` and `count_b` will hold the total number of elements in lists `a` and `b` respectively that are less than or equal to `k`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
