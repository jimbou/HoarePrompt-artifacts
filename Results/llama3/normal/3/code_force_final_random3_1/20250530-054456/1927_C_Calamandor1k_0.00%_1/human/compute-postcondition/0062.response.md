State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `i` is equal to the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b`, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `d` is `k // 2`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`**
