Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `d` is `k // 2`. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 3, otherwise `count_a` is 2. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is 2, otherwise `count_b` is 1 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `len_b` is not greater than `i + 1`, otherwise `count_b` is 0. If `len_b` is not greater than `i + 1`, then `count_b` is 1 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_b` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `count_a` has been incremented by 1. The value of `count_a` is now 3 if `len_a` is greater than `i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
