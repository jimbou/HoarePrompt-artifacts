Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 1, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 1, i is 0, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus one if a[i] is less than or equal to k and len_a is greater than i + 1, otherwise count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus one, d is k // 2. The current value of len_b is greater than i + 1. The current value of b[i] is less than or equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of count_b has been incremented by 1, because the current value of b[i] is less than or equal to k.
