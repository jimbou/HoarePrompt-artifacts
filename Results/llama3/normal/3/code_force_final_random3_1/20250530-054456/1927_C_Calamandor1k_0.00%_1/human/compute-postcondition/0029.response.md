The code prints 'YES' if the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` is greater than or equal to `d` and the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is also greater than or equal to `d`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Output: **YES if count_a >= d and count_b >= d, otherwise NO**
