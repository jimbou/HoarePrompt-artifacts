Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 2, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 2, `i` is 2. If the current value of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then the current value of `count_a` is 3, otherwise `count_a` is 2. If the length of `b` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is 2, otherwise no changes are made to `count_b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count_a` is incremented by 1. If the length of `a` is greater than 3 and the third element of `a` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` becomes 3, otherwise it becomes 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
