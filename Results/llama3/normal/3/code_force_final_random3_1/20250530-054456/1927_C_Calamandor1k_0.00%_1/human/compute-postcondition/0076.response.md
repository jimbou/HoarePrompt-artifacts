Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 1, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 1, i is 1, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus two if a[i] is less than or equal to k and len_a is greater than i + 1, otherwise count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus one, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus one if b[i] is less than or equal to k and len_b is greater than i + 1, otherwise count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k, d is k // 2**

In this output state, the value of count_a has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the variables also remain the same, with the exception of count_a, which now has a different value based on the conditions specified.
