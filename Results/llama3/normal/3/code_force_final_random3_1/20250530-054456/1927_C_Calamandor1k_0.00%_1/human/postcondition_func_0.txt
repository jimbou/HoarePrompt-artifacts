This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether the number of elements in two lists (a and b) that are less than or equal to a given threshold (k // 2) is at least k // 2. The function processes t test cases, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For each test case, it reads three integers (n, m, and k) and two lists of integers (a and b). It then counts the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k and prints 'YES' if both counts are at least k // 2, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
