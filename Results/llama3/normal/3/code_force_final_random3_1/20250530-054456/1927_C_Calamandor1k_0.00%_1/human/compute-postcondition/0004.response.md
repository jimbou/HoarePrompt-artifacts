Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0. The current value of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`.**
