The code prints 'YES' if the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k // 2` is at least `k // 2` and the number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k // 2` is at least `k // 2`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Here, `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2.

Output: **YES if count_a is greater than or equal to k // 2 and count_b is greater than or equal to k // 2, otherwise NO**
