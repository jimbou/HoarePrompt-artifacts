To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `len_a`, and `len_b`. The loop will execute if `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is `k // 2`**
