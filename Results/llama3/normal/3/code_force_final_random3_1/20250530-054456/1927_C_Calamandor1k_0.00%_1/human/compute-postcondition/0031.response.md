To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `i` is equal to the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b`. If the current value of `len_a` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the current value of `count_a` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`. If the length of `b` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the current value of `count_b` is equal to the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. The print statement will output 'YES' if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`, otherwise it will output 'NO'.**
