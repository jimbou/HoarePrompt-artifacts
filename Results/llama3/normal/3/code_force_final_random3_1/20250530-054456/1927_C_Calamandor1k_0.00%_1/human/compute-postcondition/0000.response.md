Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, with the specified constraints on their values.
