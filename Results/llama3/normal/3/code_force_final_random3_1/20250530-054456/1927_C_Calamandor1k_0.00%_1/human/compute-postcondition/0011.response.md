Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `count_a` is 1, `count_b` is 1. If the current value of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then the current value of `count_a` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count_a`. The current value of `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`. The current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `count_b` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `count_a` and `count_b` are still valid, and the lengths of lists `a` and `b` are still at least 1. The value of `i` is still 0, and the conditions related to `len_a`, `a[i]`, `len_b`, and `b[i]` are still valid.
