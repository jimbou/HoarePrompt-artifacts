Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
    count_a, count_b = 0, 0
    d = k // 2
    for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
        if len_a > i + 1:
            if a[i] <= k:
                count_a += 1
        if len_b > i + 1:
            if b[i] <= k:
                count_b += 1
    print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `i` is equal to the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b`. If the current value of `len_a` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the current value of `count_a` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`. If the length of `b` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the current value of `count_b` is equal to the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. The print statement will output 'YES' if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`, otherwise it will output 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `i` is equal to the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b`, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `d` is `k // 2`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a and must be at least 1, len_b is the length of b and must be at least 1, i is equal to the maximum of len_a and len_b, count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k, d is k // 2, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k // 2 is at least k // 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
