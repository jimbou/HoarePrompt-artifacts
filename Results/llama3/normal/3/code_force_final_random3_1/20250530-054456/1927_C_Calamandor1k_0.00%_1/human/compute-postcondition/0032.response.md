Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a, len_b is the length of b, i is equal to the maximum of len_a and len_b, count_a is 0, count_b is 0, d is k // 2**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, and `i` are updated based on the input and calculations performed in the code. The value of `d` is calculated as `k // 2`. The values of `count_a` and `count_b` are initialized to 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2 due to the two `input()` calls.
