Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

6 5 6
2 3 8 5 6 5
1 3 4 10 5

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to choose exactly 3 elements from each array in the required way. The program only checks if the count of elements in each array that are less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to k/2, but it does not check if the elements can be chosen in such a way that every integer from 1 to k is included.

A correct solution would need to check if the elements can be chosen in such a way that every integer from 1 to k is included, not just if the count of elements in each array is sufficient.
