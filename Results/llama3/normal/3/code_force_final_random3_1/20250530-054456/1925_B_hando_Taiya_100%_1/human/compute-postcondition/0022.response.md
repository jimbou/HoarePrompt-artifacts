Output State: **t is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), x is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), ans is the maximum of the previous value of ans and x // i if n is less than or equal to x // i, otherwise ans is the maximum of the previous value of ans and i if n is less than or equal to i, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and n (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), i is isqrt(x) + 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. The value of `i` is `isqrt(x) + 1`, indicating that the loop has executed for all possible values of `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x)`. The state of the other variables, `t`, `x`, `n`, and `stdin`, remains unchanged.
