Output State: **`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), `i` is 1.**

The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is equal to `x`. Therefore, `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`.
