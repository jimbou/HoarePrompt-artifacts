Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `n` is larger than `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), `i` is 2***
