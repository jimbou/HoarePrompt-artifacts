Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and must be greater than or equal to 9, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and 3 if `n` is less than or equal to `x // 3`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `n` is larger than `x // i` and `x` is divisible by 2, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and 2 if `x` is divisible by 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), `i` is 3***
