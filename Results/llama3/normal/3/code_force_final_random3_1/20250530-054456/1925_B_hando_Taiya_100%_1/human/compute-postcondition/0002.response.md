Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` inputs: `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`***
