Output State: **`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`. Since `i` is 1, `ans` will be either 0 (if its previous value was 0) or 1 (if its previous value was greater than 0). The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain the same, and the stdin contains one less input pair.
