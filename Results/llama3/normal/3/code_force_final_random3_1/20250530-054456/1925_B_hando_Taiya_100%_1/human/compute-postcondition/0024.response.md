The code prints the value of `ans` which is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. Where `i` is `isqrt(x) + 1`, `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), and `t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
Output: ** t is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), x is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), ans is the maximum of the previous value of ans and x // i if n is less than or equal to x // i, otherwise ans is the maximum of the previous value of ans and i if n is less than or equal to i, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and n (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), i is isqrt(x) + 1, and ans is printed**
