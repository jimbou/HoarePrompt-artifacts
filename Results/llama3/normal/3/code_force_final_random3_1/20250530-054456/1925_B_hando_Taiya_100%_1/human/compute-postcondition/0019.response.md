Output State: **`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and must be greater than or equal to 9, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 3`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3. The input in `stdin` remains the same, containing `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`.
