The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and must be greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is 3 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 9.
State: **`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and must be greater than or equal to 9, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ x), `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 2` if `n` is less than or equal to 2 and `x` is divisible by 2, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `n` is larger than `x // i` and `x` is divisible by 2, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and 2 if `x` is divisible by 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), `i` is 3**
