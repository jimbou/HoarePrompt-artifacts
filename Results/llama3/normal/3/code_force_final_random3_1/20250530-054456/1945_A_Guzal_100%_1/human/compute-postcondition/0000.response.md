Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c, where a, b, and c are non-negative integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is a non-negative integer because it is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function, so the remaining test cases are still in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.
