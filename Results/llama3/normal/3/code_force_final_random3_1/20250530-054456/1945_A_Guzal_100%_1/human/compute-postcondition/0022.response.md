Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-negative integer equal to the first value from the input, `b` is a non-negative integer equal to the second value from the input, `c` is a non-negative integer equal to the third value from the input, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c)` is divisible by 3, otherwise `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, and the value of `k` is being printed**
