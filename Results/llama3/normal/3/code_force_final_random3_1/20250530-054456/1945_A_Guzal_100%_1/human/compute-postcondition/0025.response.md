The code block reads three non-negative integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. It also initializes a new variable `k` to 0.

Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, k is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
