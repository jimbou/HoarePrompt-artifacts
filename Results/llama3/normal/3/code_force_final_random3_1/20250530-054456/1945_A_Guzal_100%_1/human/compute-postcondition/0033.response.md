Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b and c is less than 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, k is equal to a plus one-third of the sum of b and c plus 1 and k is printed. If the sum of b and c is divisible by 3, k is equal to a plus one-third of the sum of b and c and k is printed. stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.***
