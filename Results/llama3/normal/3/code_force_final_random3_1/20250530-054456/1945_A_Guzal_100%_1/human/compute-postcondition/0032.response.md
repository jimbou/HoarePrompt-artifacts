Output: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer. If the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, `k` is equal to `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus 1. Otherwise, `k` is equal to `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`. stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and k is printed**
