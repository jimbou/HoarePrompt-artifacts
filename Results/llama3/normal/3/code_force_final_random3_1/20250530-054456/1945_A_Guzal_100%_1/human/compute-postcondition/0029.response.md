The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The value of `k` was equal to `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, so the new value of `k` is `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is equal to `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
