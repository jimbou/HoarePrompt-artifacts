Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3 plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either `b` is divisible by 3 or `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3. The current value of `b + c` is not divisible by 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The conditions on `b` and `c` are still valid, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
