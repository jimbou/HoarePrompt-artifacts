Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either `b` is divisible by 3 or `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3. If `b + c` is not divisible by 3, `k` is `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3 plus 1. Otherwise, `k` is `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3.***
