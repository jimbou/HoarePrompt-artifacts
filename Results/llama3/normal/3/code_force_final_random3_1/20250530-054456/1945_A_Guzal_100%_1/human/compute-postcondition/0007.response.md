Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Either `b` is divisible by 3 or `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been updated to be the sum of `a` and the integer division of `b + c` by 3. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The condition that either `b` is divisible by 3 or `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3 still holds. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
