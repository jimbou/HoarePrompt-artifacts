Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c, where a, b, and c are non-negative integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    k = 0
    if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
        print(-1)
    else:
        k += a + (b + c) // 3
        if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            k += 1
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, i is 0, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If b is not divisible by 3 and b % 3 + c is less than 3, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if b + c is not divisible by 3, k is a plus the integer division of b + c by 3 plus 1 and the value of k is printed. If b + c is divisible by 3, k is a plus the integer division of b + c by 3 and the value of k is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, i is 1, a is a non-negative integer equal to the first value from the input, b is a non-negative integer equal to the second value from the input, c is a non-negative integer equal to the third value from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is being printed. Otherwise, k is a + (b + c) // 3 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1, and the value of k is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b and c is less than 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, k is equal to a plus one-third of the sum of b and c plus 1 and k is printed. If the sum of b and c is divisible by 3, k is equal to a plus one-third of the sum of b and c and k is printed. stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
