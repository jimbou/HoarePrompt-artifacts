This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c. It then calculates a value k based on the values of a, b, and c. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b and c is less than 3, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of k, which is a plus the integer division of (b + c) by 3, plus 1 if (b + c) is not divisible by 3. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding values of k or -1.
