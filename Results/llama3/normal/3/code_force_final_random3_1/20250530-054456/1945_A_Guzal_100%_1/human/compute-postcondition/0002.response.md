Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is 0, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, k is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code block reads a line from stdin, which contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c, and assigns them to the variables a, b, and c, respectively. The variable k is initialized to 0. The values of n and i remain unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
