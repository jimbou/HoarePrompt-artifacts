Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-negative integer equal to the first value from the input, `b` is a non-negative integer equal to the second value from the input, `c` is a non-negative integer equal to the third value from the input, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the sum of `a` and the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
