Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, i is 1, a is a non-negative integer equal to the first value from the input, b is a non-negative integer equal to the second value from the input, c is a non-negative integer equal to the third value from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is being printed. Otherwise, k is a + (b + c) // 3 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1, and the value of k is being printed.***
