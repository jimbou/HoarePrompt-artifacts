Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, i is 0, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If b is not divisible by 3 and b % 3 + c is less than 3, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if b + c is not divisible by 3, k is a plus the integer division of b + c by 3 plus 1 and the value of k is printed. If b + c is divisible by 3, k is a plus the integer division of b + c by 3 and the value of k is printed.***
