Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is equal to `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to include the sum of `a` and one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
