The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is a non-negative integer equal to the first value from the input, b is a non-negative integer equal to the second value from the input, c is a non-negative integer equal to the third value from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
