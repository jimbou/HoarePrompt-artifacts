Output State: **n is 0, i is n, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, stdin contains no test cases. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, k is a + (b + c) // 3 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1, and the value of k is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the initial value of `n`, and `n` will be 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last values read from the input. If the last test case had `b` not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` less than 3, then -1 will be printed. Otherwise, the value of `k` will be calculated based on the last values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and printed. The input will be exhausted, containing no more test cases.
