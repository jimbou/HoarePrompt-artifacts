Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is 1, a is a non-negative integer equal to the first value from the input, b is a non-negative integer equal to the second value from the input, c is a non-negative integer equal to the third value from the input, k is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

The code block reads three non-negative integers from the input and assigns them to the variables a, b, and c. The variable k is initialized to 0. The values of n and i remain unchanged. The input is reduced by one test case.
