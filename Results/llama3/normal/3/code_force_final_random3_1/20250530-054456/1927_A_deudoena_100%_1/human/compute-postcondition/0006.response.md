The only object in the loop head is variable  j and string s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s.  If the string has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, s has at least 1 character, j is the first character in the string s. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 2 characters and the j is the second character in the string.
State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 2 characters, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 1 if the first character in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is 1, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the second character in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.**
