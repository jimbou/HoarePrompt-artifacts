Functionality: **This function calculates the length of the shortest sub-strip of a given strip of white ('W') and black ('B') cells that contains at least one black cell. If the strip contains at least one black cell, the function returns the length of the shortest sub-strip; otherwise, it returns 2. The function takes no arguments and reads input from standard input, expecting multiple test cases where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the length of the strip, and the second line contains the strip itself.**
