Output State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the last character in the string `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still contains at least one character, which is either 'W' or 'B', and the last character of `s` is still stored in `j`. The index of the first 'B' in `s`, if it exists, is still stored in `mi`, and the length of `s` is still stored in `c`. The list `l` is still empty, and the values of `m` and `ma` are still unchanged.
