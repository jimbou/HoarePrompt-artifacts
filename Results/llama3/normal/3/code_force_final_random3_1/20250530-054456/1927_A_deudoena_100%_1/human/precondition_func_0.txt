stdin contains multiple lines of input: the first line contains an integer (number of test cases), and each subsequent test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.
