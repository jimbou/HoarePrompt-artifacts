Output State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `c` is 1, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the first character in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each consisting of two lines: an integer and a string of 'W's and 'B's.
