Output State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 2 characters, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 1 if the first character in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the second character in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged, including `m`, `s`, `ma`, `mi`, `d`, `l`, and `j`. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each consisting of two lines: an integer representing the length of the strip and a string of 'W's and 'B's representing the strip itself.
