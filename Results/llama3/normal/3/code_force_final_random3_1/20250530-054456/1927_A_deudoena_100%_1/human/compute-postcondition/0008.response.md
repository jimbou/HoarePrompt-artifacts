Output State: **m is an integer, s is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 2 characters, ma is 0, mi is 2, c is 2, d is 0, l is an empty list, j is the second character in the string s, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.**

The code assigns the value of `c` to `mi`, making `mi` equal to 2. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
