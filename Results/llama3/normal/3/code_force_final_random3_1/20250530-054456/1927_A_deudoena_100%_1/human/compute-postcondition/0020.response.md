To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for j in s[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the string `s` in reverse order.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `m` is an integer
* `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character
* `c` is `len(s)`
* `d` is 1
* `l` is an empty list
* If the last character in the string `s` is 'B', then `ma` is `len(s) - 1` and `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0. Otherwise, `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when we move to the next character in the reversed string `s`.

* `j` will be the next character in the reversed string `s`. Since we are iterating in reverse order, `j` will be the second-to-last character in `s`.
* `s` remains the same, as we are not modifying the original string.
* `c` remains the same, as it is the length of the original string `s`.
* `d` remains the same, as it is not related to the loop iteration.
* `l` remains the same, as it is not related to the loop iteration.
* `ma` and `mi` may change if the last character in the string `s` is 'B'. If the second-to-last character is 'B', then `ma` will be updated to `len(s) - 2` and `mi` will be updated to the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` will be 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list. If the second-to-last character in the string `s` is 'B', then `ma` is `len(s) - 2` and `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0. Otherwise, `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged.**
