Output State: **The program returns the difference between the length of the string `s` minus the distance `d` and the index of the first 'B' in `s` plus 2, but only if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise it returns 2.**

In this output state, `ma` is either `len(s) - d` (if 'B' exists in `s`) or 0 (if 'B' does not exist in `s`), and `mi` is either the index of the first 'B' in `s` (if 'B' exists in `s`) or 0 (if 'B' does not exist in `s`). The program returns the result of subtracting `mi` from `ma` and then adding 2.
