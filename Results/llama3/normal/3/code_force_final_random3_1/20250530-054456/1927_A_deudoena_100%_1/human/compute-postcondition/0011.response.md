Output State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 3 characters, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 2 if the third character in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 1 if the first or second character in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `c` being 3. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, with each test case consisting of two lines: an integer representing the length of the strip and a string of 'W's and 'B's representing white and black cells, respectively.
