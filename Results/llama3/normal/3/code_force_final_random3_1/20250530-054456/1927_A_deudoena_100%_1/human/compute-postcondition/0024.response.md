To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in s[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the string `s` in reverse order.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `m` is an integer
* `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character
* `c` is `len(s)`
* `d` is 2
* `l` is an empty list
* If the second-to-last character in the string `s` is 'B', then `ma` is `len(s) - 2` and `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0. Otherwise, `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* Since we are iterating over the string `s` in reverse order, the next character to be processed is the second-to-last character of the original string `s`.
* The length of the string `s` remains the same, so `c` remains unchanged.
* The value of `d` is not affected by the loop, so it remains 2.
* The list `l` is not affected by the loop, so it remains empty.
* The values of `ma` and `mi` depend on the second-to-last character of the string `s`. If it is 'B', then `ma` and `mi` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list. If the second-to-last character in the string `s` is 'B', then `ma` is `len(s) - 2` and `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0. Otherwise, `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged.**

Note that the state of `j` is not explicitly mentioned, as it is a loop variable that takes on the value of the next character in the string `s` during each iteration.
