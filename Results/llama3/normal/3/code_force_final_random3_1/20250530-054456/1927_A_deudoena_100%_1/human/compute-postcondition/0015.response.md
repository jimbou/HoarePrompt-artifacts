To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `s`. The loop will iterate over the characters in `s` in reverse order. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. Since `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least `len(s)` characters, we can conclude that `s` must have at least one character.

The variable `j` will take on the value of each character in `s` in reverse order. Since we are iterating over the characters in `s` in reverse order, the first value of `j` will be the last character in the string `s`.

State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the last character in the string `s`**
