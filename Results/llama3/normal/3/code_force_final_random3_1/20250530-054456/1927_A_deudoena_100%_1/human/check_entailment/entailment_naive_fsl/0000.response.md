Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input string is "BB", the program returns 4, but the correct answer is 2. This is because the program is adding 2 to the result, which is not necessary.

The correct program should be:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d + 1
            break
    return ma - mi + 1
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white.
