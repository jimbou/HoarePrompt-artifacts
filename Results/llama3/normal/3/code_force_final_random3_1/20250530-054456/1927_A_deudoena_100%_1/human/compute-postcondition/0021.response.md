Output State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list. If the second-to-last character in the string `s` is 'B', then `ma` is `len(s) - 2` and `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0. Otherwise, `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `d` being 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still contains at least one character and consists of 'W's and 'B's. The length of `s` is still stored in `c`. The list `l` is still empty. The values of `ma` and `mi` depend on the second-to-last character in `s` and the existence of 'B' in `s`, respectively, and remain unchanged if the conditions are not met.
