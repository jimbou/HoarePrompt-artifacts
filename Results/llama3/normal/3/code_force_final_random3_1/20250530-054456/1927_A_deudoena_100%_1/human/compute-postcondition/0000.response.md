Output State: **m is an integer (number of test cases), s is a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells), ma is 0, mi is 0, c is 0, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.**

The code initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, and `c` and `d` to 0. It also creates an empty list `l`. The code then reads the number of test cases `m` from stdin and the first line of the first test case `s` from stdin. The remaining input in stdin consists of multiple lines, each containing a test case with two lines: an integer representing the length of the strip, and a string of 'W's and 'B's representing white and black cells respectively.
