Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 3 characters, `ma` is 0, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line. If the third character in the string `s` is 'B', then `mi` is 3, otherwise `mi` is 2 if the third character in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 1 if the first or second character in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 0.***
