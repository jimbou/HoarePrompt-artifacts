Output State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least `len(s)` characters, `ma` is `len(s) - d` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `ma` is 0, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is `len(s)`, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the first character in the string `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following properties:

- `m` remains an integer.
- `s` remains a string of 'W's and 'B's with at least `len(s)` characters.
- `ma` will be the index of the last 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise it will be 0.
- `mi` will be the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise it will be 0.
- `c` will be equal to `len(s)`.
- `d` will be equal to `len(s)`.
- `l` will remain an empty list.
- `j` will be the first character in the string `s`.
