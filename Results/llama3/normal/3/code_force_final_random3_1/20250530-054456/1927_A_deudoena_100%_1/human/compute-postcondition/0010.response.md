To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 characters. Therefore, `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `j` must be the third character in the string `s`.

The other variables (`m`, `ma`, `mi`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and stdin) are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 3 characters, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 2 if the third character in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 1 if the first or second character in the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.**
