You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input: the first line contains an integer (number of test cases), and each subsequent test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least `len(s)` characters, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the last character in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least `len(s)` characters, `ma` is `len(s) - d` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `ma` is 0, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is `len(s)`, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the first character in the string `s`.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the length of the string `s` minus the distance `d` and the index of the first 'B' in `s` plus 2, but only if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise it returns 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the length of the string `s` minus the distance `d` and the index of the first 'B' in `s` plus 2, but only if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise it returns 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
