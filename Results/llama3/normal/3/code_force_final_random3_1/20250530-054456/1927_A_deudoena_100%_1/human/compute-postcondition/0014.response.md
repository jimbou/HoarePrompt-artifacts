Output State: **`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least `len(s)` characters, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the last character in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input: each test case consists of two lines - the first line contains an integer (length of the strip), and the second line contains a string of 'W's and 'B's (representing white and black cells respectively) of the same length as the integer in the first line.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `m` remains unchanged, the string `s` must have at least as many characters as its length, `ma` is still 0, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0, `c` is equal to the length of `s`, `d` is still 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the last character in the string `s`. The input in stdin remains the same, with each test case consisting of two lines - the first line containing an integer representing the length of the strip, and the second line containing a string of 'W's and 'B's representing white and black cells respectively, with the same length as the integer in the first line.
