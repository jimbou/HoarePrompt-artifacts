Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer, `s` is a string of 'W's and 'B's that must have at least 1 character, `c` is `len(s)`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list. If the last character in the string `s` is 'B', then `ma` is `len(s) - 1` and `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in `s` if 'B' exists in `s`, otherwise `mi` is 0. Otherwise, `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged.***
