Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, as it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. 

If the elements are not all the same, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first integer in the array. This is because removing these consecutive occurrences would make the array not beautiful. 

The program uses a flag to check if all elements are the same, and a variable `ans` to store the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first integer. It iterates through the array to find the minimum count and updates `ans` accordingly. 

Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
