Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, ans is Infinity, val is the first integer in arr, cnt is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**
