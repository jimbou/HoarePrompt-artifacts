Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, val is the first integer in arr. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and cnt + 1, and cnt is either 2 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or 1 if the first element of arr is not equal to `val`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `ans` is the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and cnt, and cnt, and cnt is either 1 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or 0 if the first element of arr is not equal to `val`. `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. This means that `ans` will be the smallest value it can be, given the current values of `cnt` and the previous value of `ans`.
