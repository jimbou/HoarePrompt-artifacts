Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, ans is the minimum of Infinity and cnt, val is the first integer in arr, cnt is 0, and the first element of arr is not equal to val.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value (Infinity) and `cnt` (which is 0). Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
