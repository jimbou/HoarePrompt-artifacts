Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, because it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. 

If the elements are not all the same, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first integer in the array. This is because the array can be made not beautiful by removing these consecutive occurrences. 

The program uses a variable 'ans' to store the minimum count, and it updates 'ans' whenever it finds a smaller count. 

The program also handles the case where the first integer appears at the end of the array, by updating 'ans' one more time after the loop. 

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
