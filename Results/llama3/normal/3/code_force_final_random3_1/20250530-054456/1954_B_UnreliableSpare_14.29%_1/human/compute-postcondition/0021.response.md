Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, `ans` is the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and cnt, and cnt, val is the first integer in arr, and cnt is either 1 if the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or 0 if the first element of arr is not equal to val.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and cnt, and cnt. This means that `ans` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether the first element of `arr` is equal to `val` or not.
