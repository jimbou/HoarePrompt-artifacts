Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, val is the first integer in arr, and cnt is either the number of times `val` appears in arr if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or the number of times `val` appears in arr minus 1 if the last element of arr is not equal to val. If flag is True, -1 is printed. Otherwise, ans is the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and cnt, and the number of times `val` appears in arr if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and cnt, and the number of times `val` appears in arr minus 1 if the last element of arr is not equal to val, and ans is printed.**
