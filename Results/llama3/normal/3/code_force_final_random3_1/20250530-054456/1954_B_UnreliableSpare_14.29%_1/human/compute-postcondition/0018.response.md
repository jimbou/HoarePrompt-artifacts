Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, ans is the minimum of Infinity and cnt, val is the first integer in arr, and cnt is either 1 if the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or 0 if the first element of arr is not equal to val.***
