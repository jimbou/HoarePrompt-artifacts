Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, i is n, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, ans is Infinity, val is the first integer in arr, cnt is 0.**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `ans` and `val`, and assigns a value to `cnt`. The first line sets `ans` to infinity, represented by `Decimal('Infinity')`. The second line assigns the first element of the list `arr` to `val` and sets `cnt` to 0. The initial state's variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `stdin`, and `flag` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
