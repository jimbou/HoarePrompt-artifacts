The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 3 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, i is 3, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases, flag is False.**
