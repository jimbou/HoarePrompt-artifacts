Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If the elements are not all the same, the program then finds the minimum count of the first element in the array. This is because the first element is the one that needs to be replaced to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program then prints the minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
