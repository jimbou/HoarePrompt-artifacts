To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1, we can set `i` to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `flag` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1**
