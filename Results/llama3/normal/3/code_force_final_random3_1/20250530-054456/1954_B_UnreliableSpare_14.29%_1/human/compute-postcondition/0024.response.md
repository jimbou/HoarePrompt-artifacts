Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, val is the first integer in arr, cnt is either 3 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or 2 if the first element of arr is not equal to `val`, and `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and cnt + 1 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and cnt, and cnt if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is now 3, and `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and `cnt + 1`, which is `cnt + 1`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is now 2, and `ans` is the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and `cnt`, and `cnt`, which is `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
