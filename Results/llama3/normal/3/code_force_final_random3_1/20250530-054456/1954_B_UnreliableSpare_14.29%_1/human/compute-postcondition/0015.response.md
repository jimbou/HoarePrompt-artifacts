Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, ans is Infinity, val is the first integer in arr, cnt is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` was 0, so the new value of `cnt` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is still 0, `n` is still greater than 0, `arr` is still a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1, `flag` is still False, `ans` is still Infinity, `val` is still the first integer in `arr`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is still equal to `val`.
