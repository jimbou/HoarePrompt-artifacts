Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, i is 1, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If the current value of arr[i] is not equal to the current value of arr[i - 1], then flag is set to False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
