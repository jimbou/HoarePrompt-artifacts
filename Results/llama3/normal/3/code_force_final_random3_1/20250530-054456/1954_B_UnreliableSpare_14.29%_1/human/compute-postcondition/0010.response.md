Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, i is 3, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains multiple test cases, flag is False. If arr[i] is not equal to arr[i - 1], then the state of the program remains the same. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
