Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, flag is False, ans is the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and cnt, and the number of times `val` appears in arr if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or the minimum of the minimum of Infinity and cnt, and the number of times `val` appears in arr minus 1 if the last element of arr is not equal to val, val is the first integer in arr, and cnt is either the number of times `val` appears in arr if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or the number of times `val` appears in arr minus 1 if the last element of arr is not equal to val.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is either the number of times `val` appears in `arr` if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, or the number of times `val` appears in `arr` minus 1 if the last element of `arr` is not equal to `val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
