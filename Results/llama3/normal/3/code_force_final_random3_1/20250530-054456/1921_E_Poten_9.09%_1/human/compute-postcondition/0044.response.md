Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. Either (clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0) or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0). The current value of clues[3] is equal to the current value of clues[5].**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice', the value of i remains 0, the list of clues is unchanged, the standard input still contains multiple test cases minus two integers, and the conditions on the values of clues[0], clues[2], clues[3], clues[4], and clues[5] are still satisfied.
