Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. The current value of clues[3] is equal to clues[5].**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Bob'. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `clues` and `stdin` are still valid.
