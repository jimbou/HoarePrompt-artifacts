Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Bob', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending 'Bob' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two integers.
