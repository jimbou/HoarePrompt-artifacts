Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If the difference between the fifth and first clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth and third clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, then 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list.***
