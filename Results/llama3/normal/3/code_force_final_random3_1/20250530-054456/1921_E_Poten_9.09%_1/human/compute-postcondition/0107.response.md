Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`.***
