The code appends 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The initial state of `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. After appending 'Draw', the list will contain 'Draw' as the last element. The initial state of `test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of two integers. These values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw' as the last element, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**
