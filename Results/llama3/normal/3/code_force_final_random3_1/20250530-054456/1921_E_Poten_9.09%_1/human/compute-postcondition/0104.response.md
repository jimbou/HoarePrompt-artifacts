Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If the difference between the fifth and first clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by two, or the difference between the fifth and third clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by two, then 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list. `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.***
