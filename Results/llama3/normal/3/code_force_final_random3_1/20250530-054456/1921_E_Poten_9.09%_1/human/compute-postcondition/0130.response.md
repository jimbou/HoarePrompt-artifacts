Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[2]` or `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` has one more 'Draw' at the end. Otherwise, `answers` has 'Bob' at the end. `i` is 2 and `clues` is a list of two integers.***
