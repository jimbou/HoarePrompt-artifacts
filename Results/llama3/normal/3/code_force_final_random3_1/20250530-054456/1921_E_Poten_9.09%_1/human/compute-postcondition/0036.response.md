Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is greater than clues[5] and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1. Additionally, the difference between clues[1] and clues[3] is less than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, and the difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'Bob'. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
