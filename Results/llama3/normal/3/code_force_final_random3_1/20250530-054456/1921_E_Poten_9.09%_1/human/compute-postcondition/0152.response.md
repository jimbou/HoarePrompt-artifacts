Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`.***
