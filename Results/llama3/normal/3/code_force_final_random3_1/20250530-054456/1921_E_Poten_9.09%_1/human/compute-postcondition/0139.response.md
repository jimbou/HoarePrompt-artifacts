Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and an additional 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' is added to the end of the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to the `answers` list.***
