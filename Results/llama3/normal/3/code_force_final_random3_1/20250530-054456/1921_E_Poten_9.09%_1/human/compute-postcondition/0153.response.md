Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and an additional 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**

The code appends 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `answers` now contains an additional 'Draw' element. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
