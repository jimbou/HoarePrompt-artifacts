Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. If clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity, then if clues[3] is equal to clues[5], then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If clues[3] is not equal to clues[5], then if the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1, then if the difference between clues[3] and 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or the difference between clues[5] and clues[3] is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1, then if clues[3] minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2 or clues[5] minus clues[3] is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If clues[2] and clues[4] have different parity, then if clues[3] is equal to clues[5], then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If clues[3] is not equal to clues[5], then if the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1, then if (clues[1] - clues[5]) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or (clues[5] - clues[3]) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2), then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1, then if (clues[1] - clues[5] - 1) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or (clues[5] - clues[3] - 1) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2), then 'Draw' is added to the answers list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the answers list.***
