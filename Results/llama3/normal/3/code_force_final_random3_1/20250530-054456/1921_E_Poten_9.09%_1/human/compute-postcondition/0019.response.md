Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is less than clues[5] and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1. The current value of clues[3] minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2 or clues[5] minus clues[3] is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases remains the same, the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw', the counter `i` is still 0, and the list of clues remains unchanged. The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The properties of the clues list, such as the relationship between clues[2] and clues[4], clues[3] and clues[5], and the parity of clues[2] and clues[4], are still valid.
