Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is an integer, answers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1:
                if clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5
                    ] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Bob')
            elif clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5

The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[3]` and 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, then if `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or `clues[5]` minus `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if (`clues[1]` - `clues[5]`) is greater than the absolute value of ((`clues[2]` - `clues[4]`) // 2) or (`clues[5]` - `clues[3]`) is greater than the absolute value of ((`clues[2]` - `clues[4]`) // 2), then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, then if (`clues[1]` - `clues[5]` - 1) is greater than the absolute value of ((`clues[2]` - `clues[4]`) // 2) or (`clues[5]` - `clues[3]` - 1) is greater than the absolute value of ((`clues[2]` - `clues[4]`) // 2), then 'Draw' is added to the answers list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the answers list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers` if the difference between `clues[3]` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list if the difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth and seventh clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to the `answers` list. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are not both even or both odd, then if the third and fifth clues are equal, 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list. If the third and fifth clues are not equal, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list if the difference between the fifth and first clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by two, or the difference between the fifth and third clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by two. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is not greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list. `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3]` does not equal `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.

Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
