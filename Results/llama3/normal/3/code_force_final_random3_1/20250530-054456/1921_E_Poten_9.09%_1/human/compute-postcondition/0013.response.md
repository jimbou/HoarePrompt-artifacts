Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is less than clues[5]. The absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. The current value of clues[3] minus 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or the current value of clues[5] minus clues[3] is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2 and 'Draw' has been returned**.

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw', the variable i remains 0, and the list of clues is unchanged. The input buffer still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The conditions on the clues list are still satisfied, and the string 'Draw' has been added to the answers list and returned.
