Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw' has been appended to it, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending 'Draw' to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The `answers` list now contains at least one 'Draw' in addition to its previous values, which could be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` are still the same as in the initial state.
