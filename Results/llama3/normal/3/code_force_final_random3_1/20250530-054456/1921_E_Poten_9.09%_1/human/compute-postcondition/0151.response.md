Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', and it has one more 'Alice' at the end, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending 'Alice' to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `answers` now contains one more 'Alice' than before, in addition to its original elements which could be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` are still the same as in the initial state.
