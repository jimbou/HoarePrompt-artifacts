Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.***
