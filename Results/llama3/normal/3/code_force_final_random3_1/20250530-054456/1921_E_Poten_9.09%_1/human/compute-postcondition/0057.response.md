Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. Either (clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0) or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0). The current value of clues[3] is less than clues[5] and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1. Also, (clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 is less than or equal to abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) and clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 is less than or equal to abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice', the variable i remains 0, and the list of clues is unchanged. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The conditions on the clues list are still satisfied, including the parity conditions and the absolute difference conditions.
