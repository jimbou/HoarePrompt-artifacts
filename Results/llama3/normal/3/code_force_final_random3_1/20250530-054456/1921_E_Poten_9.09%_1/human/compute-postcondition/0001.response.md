According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is an integer, `answers` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one integer. For the loop to be executed, `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one integer, `i` is 0**
