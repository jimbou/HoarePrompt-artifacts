Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. Either (clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0) or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0). clues[3] is not equal to clues[5] and the current value of clues[3] is greater than clues[5]. The absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. The current value of clues[5] minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or the current value of clues[3] minus clues[5] is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw', the counter i remains at 0, and the list of clues is unchanged. The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The conditions on the clues list are still satisfied: the second clue is less than or equal to the fourth clue, the first clue is not 1, and either the second clue is even and the fourth clue is odd or vice versa. Additionally, the third clue is greater than the fifth clue, their absolute difference is greater than 1, and either the fifth clue minus 1 or the third clue minus the fifth clue is greater than half the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues.
