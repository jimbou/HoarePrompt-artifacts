The code accepts a space-separated list of integers and assigns it to `clues`. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin is now empty we won't include it in the output state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**
