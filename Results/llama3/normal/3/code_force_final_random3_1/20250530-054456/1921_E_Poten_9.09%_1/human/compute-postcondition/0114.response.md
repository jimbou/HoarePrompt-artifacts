Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If the difference between the fifth clue and the first clue minus one is greater than the absolute difference between the second clue and the fourth clue divided by two, or the difference between the third clue and the fifth clue minus one is greater than the absolute difference between the second clue and the fourth clue divided by two, then 'Draw' is appended to the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list.***
