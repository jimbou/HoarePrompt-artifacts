Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the `clues` list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two integers.
