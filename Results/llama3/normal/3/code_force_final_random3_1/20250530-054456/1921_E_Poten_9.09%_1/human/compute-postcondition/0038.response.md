Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is greater than clues[5]. If the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1, then if the difference between clues[1] and clues[3] is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or clues[3] minus clues[5] is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1, then if the difference between clues[1] and clues[3] is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or the difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
