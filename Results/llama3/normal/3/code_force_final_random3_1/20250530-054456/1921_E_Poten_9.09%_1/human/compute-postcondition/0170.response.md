The code prints the third answer in the list `answers`.
Since the exact `answers` list is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `j`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third answer in the list.
Output: **the third answer in the list answers (which is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
