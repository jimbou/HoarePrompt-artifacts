Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the positions of Alice and Bob on the grid. The program handles various scenarios, including cases where the players are on the same row or column, and where the distance between them is greater than the difference in their x or y coordinates.

The program uses a combination of conditional statements and mathematical calculations to determine the winner of each game. It correctly checks for the conditions that lead to a draw, a win for Alice, or a win for Bob.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the test cases from the standard input, processes each test case, and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints out the results.

Overall, the program is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
