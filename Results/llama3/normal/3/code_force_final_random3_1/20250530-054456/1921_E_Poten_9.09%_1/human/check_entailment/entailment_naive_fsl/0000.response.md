Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column and Alice is above Bob. In this case, Alice can move down and capture Bob, but the program does not check for this possibility.

For example, if the input is:

6 5 2 2 5 2

The program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can move down and capture Bob.

The program only checks if Alice and Bob are in the same column and if Alice is below Bob, but it does not check if Alice is above Bob. This is a missing case that the program does not handle correctly.
