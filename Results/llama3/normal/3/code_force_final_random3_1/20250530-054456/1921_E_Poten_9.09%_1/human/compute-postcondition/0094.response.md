Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.**

The code appends 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two integers.
