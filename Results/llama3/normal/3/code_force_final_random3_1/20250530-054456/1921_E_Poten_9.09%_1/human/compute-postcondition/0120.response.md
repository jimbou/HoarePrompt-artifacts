Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers` if the difference between `clues[3]` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list if the difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth and seventh clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to the `answers` list. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are not both even or both odd, then if the third and fifth clues are equal, 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list. If the third and fifth clues are not equal, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list if the difference between the fifth and first clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by two, or the difference between the fifth and third clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by two. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is not greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list. `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.***
