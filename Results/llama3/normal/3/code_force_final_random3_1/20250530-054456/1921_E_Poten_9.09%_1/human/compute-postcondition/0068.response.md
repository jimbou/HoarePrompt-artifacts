Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. Either (clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0) or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0). clues[3] is not equal to clues[5] and the current value of clues[3] is greater than clues[5]. The absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1***
