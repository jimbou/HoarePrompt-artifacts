Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is less than clues[5]. The absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. Additionally, the difference between clues[3] and 1 is less than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, and the difference between clues[5] and clues[3] is less than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains 'Bob', the value of i remains 0, and the list of clues is unchanged. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The properties of the clues list, such as the relationship between clues[2] and clues[4], the parity of clues[2] and clues[4], and the relationships between clues[3] and clues[5], remain the same.
