Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw' has been appended to it, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending 'Draw' to it. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `answers` now contains 'Draw' in addition to its previous values, which could be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The rest of the variables, `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`, retain their initial values.
