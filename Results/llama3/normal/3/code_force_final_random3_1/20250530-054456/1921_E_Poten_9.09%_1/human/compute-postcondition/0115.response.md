Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise 'Alice' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise 'Alice' is added to `answers`. `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.***
