Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[2]` or `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` has one more 'Draw' at the end. Otherwise, `answers` has 'Bob' at the end.***
