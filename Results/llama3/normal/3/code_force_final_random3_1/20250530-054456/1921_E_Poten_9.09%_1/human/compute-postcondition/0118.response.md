Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If the third and fifth clues are equal, 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list. If the third and fifth clues are not equal, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list if the difference between the fifth and first clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by two, or the difference between the fifth and third clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by two. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is not greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list.**
