Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. Either (clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0) or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0). The current value of clues[3] is less than clues[5] and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1. The current value of (clues[1] - clues[5] - 1) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or the current value of (clues[5] - clues[3] - 1) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2).***
