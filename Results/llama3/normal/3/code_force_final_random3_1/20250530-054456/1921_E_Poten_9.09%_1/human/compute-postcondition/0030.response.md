Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is greater than clues[5] and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. Neither the difference between clues[1] and clues[3] nor the difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4].**

The code appends the string 'Bob' to the list `answers`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the stdin also remains the same as it was not affected by the code.
