The code appends 'Alice' to the list `answers`. The value of `test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of two integers. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` are not affected by the code. The list `answers` now contains one more element 'Alice'. 

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**
