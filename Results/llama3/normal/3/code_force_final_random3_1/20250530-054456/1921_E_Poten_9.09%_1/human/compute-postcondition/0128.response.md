The code `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string 'Draw' to the end of the list `answers`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and has one more 'Draw' at the end, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**
