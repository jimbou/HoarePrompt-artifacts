Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is less than clues[5] and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1. The absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2 is greater than or equal to clues[3] minus 1 and the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2 is greater than or equal to clues[5] minus clues[3].**

In natural language, the output state is that the number of test cases remains the same, the list of answers now contains the string 'Bob', the value of `i` is still 0, and the list of clues remains unchanged. The conditions on the clues also remain the same. The only change is that the list of answers now contains the string 'Bob'.
