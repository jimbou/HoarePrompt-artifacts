The current value of `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or the current value of `clues[0]` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw'. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the values of `clues[2]`, `clues[4]`, and `clues[0]` is still valid.
