This function determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two players, Alice and Bob, on a grid. It takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of six integers: the height and width of the grid, and the x and y coordinates of Alice and Bob. The function then analyzes the positions and determines the winner of each game, either Alice, Bob, or a draw. The results are stored in a list and printed out at the end. The function handles various scenarios, including cases where the players are on the same row or column, and where the distance between them is greater than the difference in their x or y coordinates.
