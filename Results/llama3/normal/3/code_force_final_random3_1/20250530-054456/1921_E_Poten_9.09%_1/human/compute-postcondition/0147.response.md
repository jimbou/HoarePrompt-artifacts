Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers**

The code appends the string 'Alice' to the list `answers`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `answers` now contains an additional element 'Alice', while the values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` are still the same as in the initial state.
