Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, then if `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is not greater than 1, then if the difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth and seventh clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, then 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to the `answers` list. `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of two integers, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers.***
