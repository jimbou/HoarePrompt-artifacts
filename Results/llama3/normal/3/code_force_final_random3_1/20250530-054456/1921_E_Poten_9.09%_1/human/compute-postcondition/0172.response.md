Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' that must have at least as many answers as `test_cases`, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains no test cases, j is the last answer in the list, and the last answer in the list which is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' is being printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables remains the same as before, except for the loop variable `j` which has taken on the value of the last answer in the `answers` list. The last answer in the list is being printed. The number of answers in the `answers` list is at least as many as the value of `test_cases`.
