Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[2]` or `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are not both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3]` does not equal `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to `answers` if the difference between the fifth and first clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth and third clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.***
