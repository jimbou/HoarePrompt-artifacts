Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. Either (clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0) or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0). The current value of clues[3] is less than clues[5]. The absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. The current value of (clues[1] - clues[5]) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or the current value of (clues[5] - clues[3]) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2).**

The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The other variables remain unchanged. The preconditions that were valid before the code execution are still valid, and the only change is the addition of 'Draw' to the `answers` list.
