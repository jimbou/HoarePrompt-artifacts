Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is greater than clues[5] and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. The current value of clues[1] minus clues[3] is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or clues[3] minus clues[5] is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2**

In this output state, the code has appended the string 'Draw' to the `answers` list, which was initially empty. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the `clues` list and the relationship between its elements are still valid.
