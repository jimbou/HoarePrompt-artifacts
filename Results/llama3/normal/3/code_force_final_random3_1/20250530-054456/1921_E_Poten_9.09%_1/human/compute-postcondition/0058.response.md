Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. Either (clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0) or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0). The current value of clues[3] is less than clues[5] and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to 1. If (clues[1] - clues[5] - 1) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or (clues[5] - clues[3] - 1) is greater than the absolute value of ((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2), then 'Draw' is added to the answers list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the answers list.**
