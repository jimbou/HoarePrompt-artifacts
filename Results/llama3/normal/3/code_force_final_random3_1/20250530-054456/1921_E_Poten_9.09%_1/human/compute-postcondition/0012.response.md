Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. The current value of clues[2] and clues[4] have the same parity. clues[3] is less than clues[5]. The absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. The current value of clues[3] minus 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or the current value of clues[5] minus clues[3] is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2***
