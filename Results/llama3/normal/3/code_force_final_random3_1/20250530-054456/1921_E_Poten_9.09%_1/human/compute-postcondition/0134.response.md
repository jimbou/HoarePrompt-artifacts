Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and an additional 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Bob'.***
