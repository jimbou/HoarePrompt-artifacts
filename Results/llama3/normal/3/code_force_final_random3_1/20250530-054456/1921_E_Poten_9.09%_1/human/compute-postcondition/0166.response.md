The only object in the loop head is variable `j` and list `answers`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the answers.  If the list has at least 2 answers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, answers has at least 1 answer, j is the first answer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 answers and the j is the second answer in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' that must have at least 2 answers, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of two integers, stdin contains no test cases, j is the second answer in the list, and the second answer in the list which is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' is being printed**
