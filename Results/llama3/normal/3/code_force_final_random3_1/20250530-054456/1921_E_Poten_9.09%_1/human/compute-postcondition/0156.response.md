Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 2 is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`.***
