Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of two integers. If `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, then 'Alice' is the last element in `answers`. If `clues[3]` does not equal `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to `answers` if the difference between the fifth and first clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth and third clues is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth clues divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` minus 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.***
