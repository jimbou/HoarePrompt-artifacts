Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers, clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4] and clues[0] is not equal to 1. Either (clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0) or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0). clues[3] is not equal to clues[5] and the current value of clues[3] is greater than clues[5]. The absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. The difference between clues[5] and 1 is less than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, and the difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is less than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice', the value of i remains 0, and the list of clues is unchanged. The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The conditions on the clues list are still satisfied: clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4], clues[0] is not equal to 1, and either clues[2] and clues[4] have different parity or both are even. Additionally, clues[3] is greater than clues[5], their absolute difference is greater than 1, and the differences between clues[5] and 1 and between clues[3] and clues[5] are both less than or equal to half the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4].
