Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of positive integers `arr` remains unchanged. The boolean variable `A` is now False, which is the opposite of its initial value. The sorted list of unique positive integers `set_` from `arr` still has at least 3 elements and starts with 1. The value of `i` remains 2. The value of `not_c` depends on the difference between the second and first elements of `set_`. If this difference is greater than 1, `not_c` is False; otherwise, it remains True.
