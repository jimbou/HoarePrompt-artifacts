Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr**

The code first assigns the value False to the variable A, leaving the list arr unchanged. The second line creates a set from the list arr, which removes any duplicate elements, and converts this set back into a list. The third line sorts this list in ascending order. The final state includes the original list arr, the boolean variable A with the value False, and the new list set_ containing unique elements from arr in sorted order.
