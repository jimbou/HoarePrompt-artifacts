Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the function `func_1(arr)`. The function checks if the smallest pile size is 1 and if the pile sizes are consecutive. However, it does not correctly determine the winner based on these conditions.

A counterexample is when the input is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will return 'Bob', but the correct answer is 'Alice'. This is because Alice can remove 2 stones from each pile, leaving `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, and then Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

The correct approach is to calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes, which is the bitwise XOR of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is 0, then Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The program does not implement this correct approach.
