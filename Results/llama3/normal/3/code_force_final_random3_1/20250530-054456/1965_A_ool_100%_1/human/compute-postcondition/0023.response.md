Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on a list of positive integers. The function checks if the list contains consecutive integers starting from 1. If the list does not start with 1, the function returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the list contains any gaps in the consecutive integers. If there are no gaps and the length of the list is even, the function returns 'Bob'. In all other cases, the function returns 'Alice'.**
