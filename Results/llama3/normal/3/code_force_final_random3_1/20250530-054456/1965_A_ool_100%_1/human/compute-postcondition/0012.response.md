Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.***
