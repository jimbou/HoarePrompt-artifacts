Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 4 elements and the first element being 1, `i` is 3. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False.**

In this output state, the only change that occurred is that the value of `A` was negated, so it is now `True`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
