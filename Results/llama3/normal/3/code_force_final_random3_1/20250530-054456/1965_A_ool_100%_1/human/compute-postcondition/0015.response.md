The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`. The second line is a `break` statement, which is used to exit a loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

The initial state provides information about the variables `arr`, `A`, `set_`, and `i`. The variable `arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is `False`, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 4 elements and the first element being 1, and `i` is 3.

Since the code snippet does not modify any of the variables `arr`, `A`, `set_`, or `i`, their values remain unchanged. The only new information is the introduction of the variable `not_c` with the value `False`.

Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr with at least 4 elements and the first element being 1, i is 3, not_c is False**
