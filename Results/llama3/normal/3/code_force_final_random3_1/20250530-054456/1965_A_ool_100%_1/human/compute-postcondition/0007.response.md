Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, the first element of set_ is 1, not_c is False, i is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`, which was previously `True`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or the execution of the code block it is part of. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state.

Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `not_c`, which is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list `arr` is still a list of positive integers, `A` is still `False`, `set_` remains a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 2 elements and the first element being 1, and `i` is still 1.
