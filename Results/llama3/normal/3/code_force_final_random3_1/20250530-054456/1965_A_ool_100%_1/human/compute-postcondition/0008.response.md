Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True and `i` is still 1.***
