Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, the first element of set_ is 1, not_c is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
        not_c = False
        break
    A = not A


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True and `i` is still 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 4 elements and the first element being 1, `i` is 3. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
