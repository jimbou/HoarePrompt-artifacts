To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `set_`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `set_`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `set_` has at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, `set_` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `arr`, `A`, `not_c` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is 3**
