Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False if the length of set_ is even and True otherwise, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr with the first element being 1, the current value of not_c is True, indicating that there is no pair of adjacent elements in set_ with a difference greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of A has been changed to its opposite, i.e., if the length of set_ is even, A is now False, and if the length of set_ is odd, A is now True. The other variables, arr, set_, and not_c, remain unchanged.
