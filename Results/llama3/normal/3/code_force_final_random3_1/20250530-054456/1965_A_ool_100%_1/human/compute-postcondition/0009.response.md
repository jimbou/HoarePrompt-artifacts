Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True and `i` is still 1.**

In this output state, the value of `A` has been changed to True, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The list `arr` is still a list of positive integers, and `set_` is still a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 2 elements, where the first element is 1. The value of `not_c` and `i` also remain the same, depending on the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_`.
