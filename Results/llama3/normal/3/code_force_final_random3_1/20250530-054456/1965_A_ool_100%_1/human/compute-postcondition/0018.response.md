Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is True if the length of set_ is even and False otherwise, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr with the first element being 1, not_c is False if there is a pair of adjacent elements in set_ with a difference greater than 1 and True otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The list `arr` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers.
*   The value of `A` depends on the length of `set_`. If the length of `set_` is even, `A` is True; otherwise, it is False. This is because `A` is toggled in each iteration of the loop.
*   The list `set_` remains unchanged as a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, with the first element being 1.
*   The value of `not_c` is False if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1. Otherwise, it remains True.
