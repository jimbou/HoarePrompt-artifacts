Postcondition: ***arr is a list of positive integers, A is True if the length of set_ is even and False otherwise, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr with the first element being 1. If there is no pair of adjacent elements in set_ with a difference greater than 1, then A is False if the length of set_ is even and True otherwise. Otherwise, the state of A remains unchanged.***
