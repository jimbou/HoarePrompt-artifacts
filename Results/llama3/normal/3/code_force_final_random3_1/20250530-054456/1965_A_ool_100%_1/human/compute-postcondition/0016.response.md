Postcondition: ***arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr with at least 4 elements and the first element being 1, i is 3. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of set_ is greater than 1, not_c is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
