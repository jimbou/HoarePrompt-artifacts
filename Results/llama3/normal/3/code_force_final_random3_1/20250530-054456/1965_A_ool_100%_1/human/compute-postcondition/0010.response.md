To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the `set_` list.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `set_`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `set_` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, since the loop will execute again, `set_` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, `not_c` is True, `i` is 2**
