Based on the given precondition, the code `print(0)` will simply print the integer value 0.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The precondition states that `n` is an integer, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
* The list `a` contains `n` integers, but its contents are not used in the print statement.
* The list `cntl` has `n+1` integers, with specific values at certain indices, but it is not used in the print statement.
* The value of `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, but it is not used in the print statement.
* The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0, but it is not used in the print statement.

Since the print statement only contains the literal integer value 0, without any variables or expressions, the output will be exactly that: the integer 0.

Output: **0**
