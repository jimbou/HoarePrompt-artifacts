Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the ith integer is 3 and the rest are 0 except the second integer which is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third integer in the list**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cntl` at index `i` (which is the third integer in the list `a`) is incremented by 1, making it 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` now has the third integer as 3, and the rest are 0 except the second integer which is 1. The other variables `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i` retain their original values.
