Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either -2 or -1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it is now either -2 or -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
