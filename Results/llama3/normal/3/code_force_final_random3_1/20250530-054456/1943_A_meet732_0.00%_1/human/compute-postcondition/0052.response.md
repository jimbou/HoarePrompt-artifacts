Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `c` is determined by taking the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. Since `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, the minimum value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
