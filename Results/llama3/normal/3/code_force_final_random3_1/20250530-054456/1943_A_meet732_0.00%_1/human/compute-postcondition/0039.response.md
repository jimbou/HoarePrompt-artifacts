The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is 0, because the loop has executed one time. So for the loop to be executed one more time `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last integer in the original list a.**
