Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last integer in the list a.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `a`. The third line creates a list of `n+1` zeros and assigns it to `cntl`. The value of `i` is not affected by the code and remains the last integer in the list `a`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
