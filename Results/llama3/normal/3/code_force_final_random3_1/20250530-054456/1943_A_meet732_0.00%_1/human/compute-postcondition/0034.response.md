Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, `c`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
