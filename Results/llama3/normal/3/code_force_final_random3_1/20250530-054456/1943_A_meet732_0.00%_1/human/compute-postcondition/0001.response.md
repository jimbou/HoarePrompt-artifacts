Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` becomes a positive integer. This also means that stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: an integer.

The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. Since `input().split()` is used, the input is expected to be a space-separated list of integers. This also means that stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

The third line creates a list `cntl` of `n+1` zeros. The value of `_` is 0, but it is not used in the calculation, so it remains 0.

Overall, the code executes without any errors, and the final state includes the values of `n`, `a`, and `cntl`, as well as the updated state of stdin.
