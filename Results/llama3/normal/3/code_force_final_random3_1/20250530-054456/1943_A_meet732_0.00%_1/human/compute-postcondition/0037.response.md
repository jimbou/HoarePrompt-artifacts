Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and `j` is `n`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations means that the loop has iterated over all values of `j` from 1 to `n`. The value of `j` is now equal to `n`, and the loop has either broken out of the most internal loop or if statement if `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, or no changes have been made if `cntl[j]` is not less than 2 or `c` is not 0 and `j` does not equal `n`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
