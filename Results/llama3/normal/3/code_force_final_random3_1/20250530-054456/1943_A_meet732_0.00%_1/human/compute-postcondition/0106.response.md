Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either -1 or 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 2. If `c` is not true or `j` equals `n`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
