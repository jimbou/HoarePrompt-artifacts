Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`**

In this output state, the value of `cntl` at index `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The rest of the values in `cntl` remain 0. The other variables, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
