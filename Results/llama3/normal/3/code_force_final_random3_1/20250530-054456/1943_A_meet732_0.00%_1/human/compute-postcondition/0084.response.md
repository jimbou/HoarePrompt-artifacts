To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 integers, and `i` must be the third integer in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where the `i-th` element is 2 and the rest are 0 except the last element which is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the list `a` plus 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`**
