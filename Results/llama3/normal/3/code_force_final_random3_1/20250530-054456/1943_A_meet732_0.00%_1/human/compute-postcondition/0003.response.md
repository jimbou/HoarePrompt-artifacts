The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `cntl` is a list of n+1 zeros. So, the value of `cntl[i]` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the ith integer is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the first integer in the list**
