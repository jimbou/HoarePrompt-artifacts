Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either -1 or 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `stdin`, `_`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
