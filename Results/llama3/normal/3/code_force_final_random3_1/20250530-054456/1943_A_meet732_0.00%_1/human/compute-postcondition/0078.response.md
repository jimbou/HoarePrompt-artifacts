The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the value of `int(input())`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is the last integer in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `int(input())` must be greater than the last integer in the list `a`. Also, stdin must contain at least 2 more inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
State: **_ is the last integer in the list a plus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is n and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, int(input()) is greater than the last integer in the list a**
