Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `cntl` will contain the count of each integer from 0 to `n` (inclusive) based on their occurrences in the original list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
