Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is either -1, 0 or 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The value of `j` which is 2 has been printed.
