Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is either 0, 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is either 0 or 1 and if `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, then `c` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is either -1, 0 or 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is either -1, 0 or 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is either -2, -1 or 0, and if `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
