Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is n and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last integer in the list a**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the count list `cntl` now reflects the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. The value at index `i` in `cntl` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and the rest of the values in `cntl` are 0, except for the value at index 2 which is one less than the number of times 2 appears in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
