Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either -1 or 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it can be either -1 or 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still empty, `n` is still greater than 0, `cntl` still contains the count of occurrences of each element in the original list `a`, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is still the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is still the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is still not equal to 0, and `j` is still 2.
