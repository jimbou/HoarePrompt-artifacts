Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it can now be either 0 or 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` still has `n+1` elements, where each element at index `i` represents the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`. The list `a` is still empty, and `n` is still an integer greater than 0. The values of `_` and `i` are still the same, representing the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1 and the last integer in the original list `a`, respectively. The value of `j` is still 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is still less than 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, minus 2 inputs.
