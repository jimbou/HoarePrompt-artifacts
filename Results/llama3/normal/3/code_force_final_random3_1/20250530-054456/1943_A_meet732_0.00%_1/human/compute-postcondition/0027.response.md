Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
