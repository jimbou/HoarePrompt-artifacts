Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and deleting them, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the remaining elements.

The program uses a frequency count array `cntl` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the input array `a`. It then iterates through the frequency count array to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array, which is the MEX.

The program handles the case where the input array does not contain the element 0 separately, as this is a special case that requires a different approach.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs. The use of the frequency count array `cntl` is an efficient way to solve the problem, as it allows the program to avoid iterating through the input array multiple times.

Correctness: **True**
