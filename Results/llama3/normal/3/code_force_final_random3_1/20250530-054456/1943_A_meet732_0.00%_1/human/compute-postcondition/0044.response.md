Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is 2 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`**

The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
