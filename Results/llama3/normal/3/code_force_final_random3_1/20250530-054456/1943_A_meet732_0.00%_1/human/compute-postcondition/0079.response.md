Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is the last integer in the list a plus 1**

The code snippet executes three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. The third line creates a new list `cntl` of `n+1` zeros. 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. The value of `a` is updated to the list of integers from stdin. The value of `cntl` is updated to a list of `n+1` zeros. The value of `_` remains the last integer in the list `a` plus 1. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
