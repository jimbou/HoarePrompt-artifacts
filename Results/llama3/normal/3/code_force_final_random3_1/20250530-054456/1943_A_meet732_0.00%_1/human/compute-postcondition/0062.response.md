The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is either 0, 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 2**
