Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then the number 0 is printed. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, then `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is `n`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `c` is false or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
