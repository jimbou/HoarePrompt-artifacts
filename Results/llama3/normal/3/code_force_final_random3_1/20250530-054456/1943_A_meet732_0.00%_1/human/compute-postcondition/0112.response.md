Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either -2 or -1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `stdin`, `_`, `i`, and `cntl[0]` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `j` is still 3, and it is being printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
