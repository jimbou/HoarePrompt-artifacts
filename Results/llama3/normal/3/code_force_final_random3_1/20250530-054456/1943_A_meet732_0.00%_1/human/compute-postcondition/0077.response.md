Postcondition: ***n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is n and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last integer in the list a. If cntl[0] is 0, then 0 is printed. If cntl[0] is not 0, then n is an integer greater than 0, c is either -n+2, -n+1 or -n+2, j is n. If cntl[j] is less than 2, then c is either -n+2, -n+1 or -n+2, and if c is 0 or j equals n, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
