Postcondition: ***n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is n and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last integer in the list a, and cntl[0] is not equal to 0***
