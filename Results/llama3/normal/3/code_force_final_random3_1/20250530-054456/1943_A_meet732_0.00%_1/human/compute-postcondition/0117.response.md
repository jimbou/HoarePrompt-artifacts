Output State: **n is an integer, a is an empty list, cntl is a list of n+1 elements where each element at index i is equal to the number of occurrences of i in the original list a, stdin contains no test cases, _ is the last integer in the original list a plus the number of test cases, i is the last integer in the original list a. If cntl[0] is 0, then the number 0 is printed. If cntl[0] is not 0, then n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, and j is n. If cntl[j] is less than 2, then if c is false or j is equal to n, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be an integer, the list `a` will be empty, and the list `cntl` will contain the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `_` will be the last integer in the original list `a` plus the number of test cases, and the variable `i` will be the last integer in the original list `a`. The loop will have printed the appropriate output for each test case, either 0 if `cntl[0]` is 0, or the smallest integer `j` such that `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such `j` is found.
