Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement we were in. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The output state includes all the information from the initial state that is still valid after the code has been executed, with the addition of breaking out of the innermost loop or if statement.
