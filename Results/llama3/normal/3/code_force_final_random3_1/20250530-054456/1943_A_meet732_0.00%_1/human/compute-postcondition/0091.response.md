Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `c` is either 1 or 2, depending on the value of `cntl[0]`. If `cntl[0]` is 1, then `c` is 1; otherwise, `c` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
