Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Additionally, either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, and the value of `j` which is 1 is being printed**
