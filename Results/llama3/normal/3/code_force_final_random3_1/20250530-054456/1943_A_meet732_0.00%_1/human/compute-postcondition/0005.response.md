Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the ith integer is 2 and the rest are 0 except the second integer which is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the second integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The rest of the values in the `cntl` list remain the same, with the second integer being 1 and the rest being 0. The values of the other variables, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i`, are unchanged.
