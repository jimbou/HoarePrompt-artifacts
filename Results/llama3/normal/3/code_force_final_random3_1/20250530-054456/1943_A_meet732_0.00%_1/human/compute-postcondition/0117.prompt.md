Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last integer in the original list a. If cntl[0] equals 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if cntl[j] is less than 2, then if c is 0 or j equals n, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is n and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last integer in the list a. If cntl[0] is 0, then 0 is printed. If cntl[0] is not 0, then n is an integer greater than 0, c is either -n+2, -n+1 or -n+2, j is n. If cntl[j] is less than 2, then c is either -n+2, -n+1 or -n+2, and if c is 0 or j equals n, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then the number 0 is printed. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, then `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is `n`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `c` is false or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
