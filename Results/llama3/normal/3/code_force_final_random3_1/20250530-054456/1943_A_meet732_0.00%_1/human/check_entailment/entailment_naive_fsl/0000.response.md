Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX of Alice's array. It first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and stores them in the `cntl` list. If 0 is not present in the array, the MEX is 0. Otherwise, it starts from 2 (since 0 and 1 are already present) and decrements the count for each number that appears less than twice. The game ends when the count reaches 0 or the end of the array is reached, and the current number is printed as the MEX.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when 0 is not present, when 0 is present but not twice, and when 0 is present twice or more. It also correctly handles the case when the array contains only one element.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
