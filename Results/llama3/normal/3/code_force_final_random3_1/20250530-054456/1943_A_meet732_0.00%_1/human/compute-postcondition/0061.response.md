Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is either 0, 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is either 0 or 1 and if `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, then `c` is 2. ***
