To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. Since `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, we can adjust the state of `i` to be the first integer in the list `a` for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`**
