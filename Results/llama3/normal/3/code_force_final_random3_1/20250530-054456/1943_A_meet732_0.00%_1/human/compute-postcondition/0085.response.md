Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where the `i-th` element is 3 and the rest are 0 except the last element which is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the list `a` plus 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` now has the `i-th` element as 3, and the rest of the elements remain the same, with the last element being 1. The other variables, including `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `_`, and `i`, retain their original values.
