Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is either -2, -1 or 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, resulting in a new value that is either -2, -1, or 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
