Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where the `i-th` element is 2 and the rest are 0 except the last element which is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the list `a` plus 1, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The rest of the elements in `cntl` remain the same, with the last element being 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `stdin`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
