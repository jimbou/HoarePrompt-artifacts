Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is `n` and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is `n-1`, `c` is either -`n`+2, -`n`+1 or -`n`+2, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is `n`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is either -`n`+2, -`n`+1 or -`n`+2, and if `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will have iterated over all values of `j` from 1 to `n`, and the value of `c` will have been decremented by 1 for each iteration where `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the value of `c` will be either -`n`+2, -`n`+1 or -`n`+2, and if `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
