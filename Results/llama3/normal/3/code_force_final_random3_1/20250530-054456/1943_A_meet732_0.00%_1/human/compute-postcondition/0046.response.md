Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is 3 and the rest are 0 except for the value at index 2 which is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`**

In this output state, the value of `cntl` at index `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. The rest of the values in `cntl` remain the same, with the value at index 2 being 2 and the rest being 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
