Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last integer in the original list a. If cntl[0] equals 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, if cntl[j] is less than 2, then if c is 0 or j equals n, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
