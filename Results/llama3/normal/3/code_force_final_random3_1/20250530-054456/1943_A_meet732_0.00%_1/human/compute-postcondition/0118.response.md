Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then finds the smallest integer that appears at least twice in the list, or the smallest integer that appears only once if no such integer exists. If the list contains no zeros, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
