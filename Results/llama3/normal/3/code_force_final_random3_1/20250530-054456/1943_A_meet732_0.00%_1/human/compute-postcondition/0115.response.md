Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either a negative integer or 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is `n`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `c` is false or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `j` is equal to `n`. The value of `c` is either a negative integer or 0, indicating that the loop has iterated at least once. The other variables remain unchanged, with `a` being an empty list, `cntl` being a list of `n+1` elements representing the occurrences of each index in the original list `a`, and `cntl[0]` being non-zero. The input from `stdin` is still multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the last integer in the original list `a` plus 1 is still stored in `_`. The last integer in the original list `a` is still stored in `i`.
