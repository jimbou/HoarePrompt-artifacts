Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains a positive integer, the list `a` is still empty, the list `cntl` still contains `n+1` integers representing the frequency of each index in the original list `a`, and the first element of `cntl` is not equal to 0. The variable `i` is still the last integer in the original list `a`. A new variable `c` is introduced, which is assigned the minimum value between 2 and the first element of `cntl`. Since `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` can be either 1 or 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
