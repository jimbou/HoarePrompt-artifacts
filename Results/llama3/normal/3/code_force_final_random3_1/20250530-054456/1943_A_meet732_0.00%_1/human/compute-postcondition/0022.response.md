Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
