To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, and `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.


For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 integers, and `i` must be the third integer in the list `a`.


State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is 2 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`**
