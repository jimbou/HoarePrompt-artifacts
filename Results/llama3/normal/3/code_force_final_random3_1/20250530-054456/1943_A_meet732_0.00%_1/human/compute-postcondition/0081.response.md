The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `cntl` now has `n+1` elements, where the `i-th` element is 1 and the rest are 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `_` is still the last integer in the list `a` plus 1. The value of `n` is still an integer. The list `a` is still a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where the `i-th` element is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is the last integer in the list `a` plus 1, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`.**
