To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each integer represents the frequency of its index in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is 1**
