To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 4 (since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1` with a step of 2). `k` should be initialized to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 4, `k` is 1, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `no_path` is True, and there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>'**
