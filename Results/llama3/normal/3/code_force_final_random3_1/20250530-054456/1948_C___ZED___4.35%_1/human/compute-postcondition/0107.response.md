Output State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 2, `k` is n-2, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b[k]` is not '>', no_path is False.**

The code sets the value of `no_path` to False. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, and the current test case still has an integer n followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. The current value of `k` is still n-2, and the current value of `b[k]` is still not '>'.
