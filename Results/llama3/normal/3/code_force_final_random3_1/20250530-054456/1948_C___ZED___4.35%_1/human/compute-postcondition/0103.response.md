Output: **i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is n-2 if n is at least 2, no_path is True if the second last character of b is '>', otherwise no_path is False. If the second last character of b is '>', 'NO' is printed. If the second last character of b is '<', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 4, if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. and 'YES' is printed**
