#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: i is t-1, stdin is empty, input() must be greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is n-2 if n is at least 2, no_path is True if the second last character of b is '>', otherwise no_path is False. If the second last character of b is '>', 'NO' is printed. If the second last character of b is '<', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 4, if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 1, then 'YES' is printed if there exists at least one k such that b[k] is not '>', and the value of k which is n-1 is being printed. If a[k] is '>', then 'YES' is printed and no action is taken. If a[k] is not '>', then no_path is False and 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. It accepts an integer t, followed by t test cases, each containing an integer n and two strings a and b of length n. The function checks the strings a and b for specific patterns and prints 'YES' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function also prints the value of k if certain conditions are met. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the stdin empty and the variables i, n, a, b, k, and no_path in a specific state.
