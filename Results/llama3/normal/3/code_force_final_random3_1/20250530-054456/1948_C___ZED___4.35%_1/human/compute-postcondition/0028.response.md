Output State: **`no_path` is False, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, `input()` must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and the second last character of b is '>', and n is not equal to 1, `n` is at least 4, `k` is 1, and the value of k which is 1 is being printed. The current value of `a[k]` is not '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `no_path` has been changed to False. The values of the other variables remain the same. The program still has t-1 test cases to process, and the conditions on the input values are still valid. The value of `i` is still 0, and the value of `k` is still 1. The current value of `a[k]` is still not '>'.
