Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is n-2 if n is at least 2, no_path is always True.**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` is always True, regardless of the second last character of string `b`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
