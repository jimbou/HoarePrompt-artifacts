The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k. If k is less than n - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is 3, n is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, k must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so k is 5 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 5.
State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 6, `k` is 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>', and the value of k which is 5 is being printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False, otherwise `no_path` remains True.**
