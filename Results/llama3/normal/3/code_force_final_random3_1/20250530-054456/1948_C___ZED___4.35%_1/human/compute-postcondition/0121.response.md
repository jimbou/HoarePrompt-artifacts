Postcondition: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 4, `k` is 1, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `no_path` is True, and there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>', and the value of k which is 1 is being printed. The current value of `a[k]` is not '>'**
