The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and n. If k is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is 2, n is even and n is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again k must be increased by 2 so k is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is 4, if b[k] is not '>', then no_path is False. Otherwise, no_path remains True.**
