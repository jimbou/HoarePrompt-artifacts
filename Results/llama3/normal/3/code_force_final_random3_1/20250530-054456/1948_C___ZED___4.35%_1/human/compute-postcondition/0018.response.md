The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 2 so `k` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`no_path` is False if the third character of `b` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains True. `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, `input()` must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and the second last character of b is '>', and n is not equal to 1, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 4**
