Output State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 4, `k` is 1, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `no_path` is False, and there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>', and the value of k which is 1 is being printed. The current value of `a[k]` is not '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `no_path` has been changed to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2, there are still t-3 test cases in stdin, `n` is still at least 4, `k` is still 1, `a` and `b` are still strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and there still exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>', and the value of k which is 1 is being printed. The current value of `a[k]` is still not '>'.
