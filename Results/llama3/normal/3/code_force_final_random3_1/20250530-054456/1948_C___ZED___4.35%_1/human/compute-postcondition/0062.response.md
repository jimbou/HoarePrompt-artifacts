The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `n` is even and greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 2.
State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is 2, if b[k] is not '>', then no_path is False. Otherwise, no_path remains True.**
