The only variables in the loop head are variables  k and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 2 so `k` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 4, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', if `b[k]` is not '>', then no_path is False. Otherwise, no_path remains True.**
