Output State: **i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is n-2 if n is at least 2, no_path is True if the second last character of b is '>', otherwise no_path is False.**

The code reads an integer `n` from stdin, followed by two strings `a` and `b`, each of length `n`. The value of `n` is stored in the variable `n`, and the strings `a` and `b` are stored in the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. If `n` is at least 2, the variable `k` is set to `n-2`. The variable `no_path` is set to `True` if the second last character of `b` is '>', otherwise it is set to `False`.
