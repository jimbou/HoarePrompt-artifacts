Output State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 6, `k` is 5, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `no_path` is False, and the value of k which is 5 is being printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False, otherwise `no_path` remains False, and the value of k which is 5 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 2, there are still t-3 test cases in the standard input, the length of strings `a` and `b` is at least 6, the value of `k` is still 5, the strings `a` and `b` still consist of '<' and/or '>', the variable `no_path` is now False, and the value of `k` which is 5 is being printed. Additionally, if the character at index `k` in string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False, otherwise `no_path` remains False.
