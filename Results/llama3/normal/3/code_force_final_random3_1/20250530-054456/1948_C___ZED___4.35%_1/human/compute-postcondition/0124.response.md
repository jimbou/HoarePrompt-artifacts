The only objects in the loop head are variables  k and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and n. If k is less than n-1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is 1, n is at least 4. For the loop to execute again k must be increased by 2 so k is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 3, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>', and the value of k which is 3 is being printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False, otherwise `no_path` remains True.**
