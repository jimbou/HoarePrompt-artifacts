Output State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 4, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `no_path` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been updated to False, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, and the strings `a` and `b` still have the same properties as before.
