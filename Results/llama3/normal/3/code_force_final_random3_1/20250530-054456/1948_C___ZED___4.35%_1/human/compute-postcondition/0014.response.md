Postcondition: ***`no_path` is True if the first character of `b` is '>', otherwise `no_path` is False. `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, `input()` must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and the second last character of b is '>', and n is not equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is 0.***
