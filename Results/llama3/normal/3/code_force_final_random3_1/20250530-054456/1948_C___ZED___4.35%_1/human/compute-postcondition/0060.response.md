Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is 0, no_path is False. The current value of b[k] is not '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 1, and the input stream still contains t-3 test cases. Each test case still consists of an integer n and two strings of length n, where n is even and within the range of 2 to 2 * 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases still doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, and input() is still greater than 0. The variables n, a, and b retain their previous values and properties. The variable k remains 0, and the current value of b[k] is still not '>'. The only change is that the variable no_path is now set to False.
