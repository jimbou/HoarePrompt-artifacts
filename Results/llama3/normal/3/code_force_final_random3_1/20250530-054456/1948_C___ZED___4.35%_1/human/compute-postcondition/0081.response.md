Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than or equal to 4, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is 3. If a[k] is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.***
