The only objects in the loop head are variables  k and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, no_path is True, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and the second last character of b is '>', and n is not equal to 1, n is at least 2, n is at least 4 and k is 1.
State: **`no_path` is True, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, `input()` must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and the second last character of b is '>', and n is not equal to 1, `n` is at least 4, `k` is 1**
