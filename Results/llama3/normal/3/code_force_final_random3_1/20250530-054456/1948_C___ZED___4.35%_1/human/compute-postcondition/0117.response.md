Output State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 2, `k` is 0, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `no_path` is True, and there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>'**.

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for `no_path`, which is now set to True. The existence of at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>' is still valid, but it is now in conflict with the value of `no_path`.
