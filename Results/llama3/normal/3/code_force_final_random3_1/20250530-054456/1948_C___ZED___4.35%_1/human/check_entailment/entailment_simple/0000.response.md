Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the second last character of the second row (b) is '<'. If it is, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'NO'.

2. If the second last character of the second row is '>', it then checks if n is 1. If n is 1, the robot can reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'YES'.

3. If n is greater than 1, it then checks if there exists at least one k such that b[k] is not '>'. If such a k exists, the robot can reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'YES'.

4. If no such k exists, it then checks if there exists at least one k such that a[k] is not '>'. If such a k exists, the robot can reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'YES'.

5. If no such k exists, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
