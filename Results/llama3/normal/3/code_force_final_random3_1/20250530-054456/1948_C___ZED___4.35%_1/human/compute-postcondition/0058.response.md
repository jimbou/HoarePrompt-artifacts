To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since `k` ranges from 0 to `n` with a step of 2). 

State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is 0, no_path is always True.**
