Output State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 3, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>', and the value of k which is 3 is being printed. `no_path` is False**

The code sets the value of `no_path` to False, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the updated value of `no_path`.
