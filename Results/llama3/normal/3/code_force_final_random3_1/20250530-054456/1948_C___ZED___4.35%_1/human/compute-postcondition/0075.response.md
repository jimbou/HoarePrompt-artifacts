Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than or equal to 4, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is 1, `no_path` is False, and the value of a[k] is not '>'**

The code sets the value of `no_path` to False. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, stdin still contains t-3 test cases, input() must still be greater than 0, n is still an integer and is greater than or equal to 4, a is still a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is still a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is still 1, and the value of a[k] is still not '>'.
