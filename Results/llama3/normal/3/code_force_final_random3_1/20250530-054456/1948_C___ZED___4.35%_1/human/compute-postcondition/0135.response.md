Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 2, `k` is n-1, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', and there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>', and the value of k which is n-1 is being printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False, otherwise `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is True, then no action is taken.***
