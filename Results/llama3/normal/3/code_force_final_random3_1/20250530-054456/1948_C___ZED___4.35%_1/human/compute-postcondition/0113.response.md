Output State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 4, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `no_path` is False**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been changed to False, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, and the lengths and contents of strings `a` and `b` are unchanged.
