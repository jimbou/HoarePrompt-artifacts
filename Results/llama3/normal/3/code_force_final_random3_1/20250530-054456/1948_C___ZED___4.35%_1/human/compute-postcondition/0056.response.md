The code prints the string 'YES'.
Output: **i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is n-2 if n is at least 2, no_path is True if the second last character of b is '>', otherwise no_path is False, and 'YES' is printed**
