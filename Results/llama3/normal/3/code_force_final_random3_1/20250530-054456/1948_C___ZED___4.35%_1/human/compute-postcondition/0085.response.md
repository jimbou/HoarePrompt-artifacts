Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer and is greater than or equal to 4, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is 5, `no_path` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is 1, there are t-3 test cases remaining in the standard input, the input must be greater than 0, the length of the strings `a` and `b` is at least 4 and consists of '<' and/or '>', the value of `k` is 5, and the variable `no_path` is now set to False.
