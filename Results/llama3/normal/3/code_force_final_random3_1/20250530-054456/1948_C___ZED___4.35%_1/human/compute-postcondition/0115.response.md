Output State: **`i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is at least 2, `k` is 0, `a` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `no_path` is False if there exists at least one `k` such that `b[k]` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` is True.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 2, and there are still t-3 test cases left in the standard input. The value of `n` is at least 2, and `k` has been reset to 0. The strings `a` and `b` still consist of '<' and/or '>' characters, but the value of `no_path` has been determined. If there was at least one iteration where `b[k]` was not '>', then `no_path` is False, indicating that there is a path. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True, indicating that there is no path.
