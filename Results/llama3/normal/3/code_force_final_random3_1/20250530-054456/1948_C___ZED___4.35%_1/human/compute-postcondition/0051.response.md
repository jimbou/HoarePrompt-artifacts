The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and *stdin contains t-1 test cases. So for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1 and *stdin contains t-2 test cases.
State: **`i` is 1, *stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, `input()` must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. If the second last character of b is not '>', "NO" is printed. If the second last character of b is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is at least 2, `k` is n-2. If `no_path` is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
