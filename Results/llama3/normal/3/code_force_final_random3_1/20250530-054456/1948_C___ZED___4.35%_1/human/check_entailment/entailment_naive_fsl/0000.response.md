Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES'. The robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the arrow in the second last cell of the second row is '>' and if the arrows in the even indexed cells of the second row are '>'. However, it does not consider the case where the robot can move down from the first row to the second row and then move right to the target cell.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible paths that the robot can take to reach the target cell.
