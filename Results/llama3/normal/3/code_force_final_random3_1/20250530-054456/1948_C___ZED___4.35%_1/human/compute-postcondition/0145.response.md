Output State: **i is t-1, stdin is empty, input() must be greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is n-2 if n is at least 2, no_path is True if the second last character of b is '>', otherwise no_path is False. If the second last character of b is '>', 'NO' is printed. If the second last character of b is '<', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 4, if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 1, then 'YES' is printed if there exists at least one k such that b[k] is not '>', and the value of k which is n-1 is being printed. If a[k] is '>', then 'YES' is printed and no action is taken. If a[k] is not '>', then no_path is False and 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `i` has reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `no_path` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The output state also describes the conditions under which 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, based on the values of `n`, `b`, and `no_path`.
