Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is even. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5, input() must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', k is 2, no_path is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 1. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases. Each test case still contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. n is still even. The sum of n over all test cases still doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5. input() must still be greater than 0. n is still an integer. a is still a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. b is still a string of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>'. k is still 2. However, the value of `no_path` has been updated to False.
