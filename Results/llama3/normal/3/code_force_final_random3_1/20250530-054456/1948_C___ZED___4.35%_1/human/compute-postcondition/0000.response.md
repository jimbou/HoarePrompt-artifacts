The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'. `n` is even. The sum of `n` over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5. So for the loop to be executed `input()` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
