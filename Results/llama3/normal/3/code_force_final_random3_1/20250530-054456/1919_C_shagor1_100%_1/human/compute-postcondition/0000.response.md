Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The integer is a positive integer and does not exceed 2*10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5. No changes have been made to the input or variables.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `pass` statement does not perform any operations or modify any variables. The input remains unchanged, and no new variables are introduced.
