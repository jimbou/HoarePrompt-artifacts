#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The integer is a positive integer and does not exceed 2*10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
    pass

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a list of n integers. It processes these test cases and produces output based on the provided inputs. The function does not modify the input variables and only uses them to generate output. After execution, the function's output is available, but the original input variables remain unchanged.
