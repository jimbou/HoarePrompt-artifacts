Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a list of n integers. It processes these test cases and produces output based on the provided inputs. The function does not modify the input variables and only uses them to generate output. After execution, the function's output is available, but the original input variables remain unchanged.**
