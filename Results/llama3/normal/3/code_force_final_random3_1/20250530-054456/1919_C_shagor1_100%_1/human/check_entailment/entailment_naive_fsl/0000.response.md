Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to split the input array into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The program uses two variables `la` and `lb` to keep track of the last elements of the two subsequences, and updates them accordingly based on the current element `i` in the input array.

The program correctly handles the cases where `i` is less than or equal to `la`, less than or equal to `lb`, or greater than both `la` and `lb`. In the first case, it updates `la` to `i`. In the second case, it updates `lb` to `i`. In the third case, it updates `la` to `lb` and `lb` to `i`, and increments the penalty `ans` by 1.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the input array has only one element, or where all elements in the input array are the same.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
