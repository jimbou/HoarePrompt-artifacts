Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and `n` additional lists with two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 0's in `a` and `y` is the number of 1's in `a`, `ans` is -1, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `S` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The variable `ans` is newly introduced and assigned the value -1. The stdin remains empty, as no input operation is performed.
