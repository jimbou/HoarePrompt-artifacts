Output State: **stdin contains no more test cases, the function func_1() has been executed a number of times equal to the number of test cases in the initial state.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, there are no more test cases left in the standard input (stdin), and the function func_1() has been executed a number of times equal to the number of test cases present in the initial state.
