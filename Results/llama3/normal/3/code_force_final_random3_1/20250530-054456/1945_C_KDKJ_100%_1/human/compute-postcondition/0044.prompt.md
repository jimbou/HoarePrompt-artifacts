Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and `n` additional lists with two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 0's in `a` and `y` is the number of 1's in `a`, `ans` is -1, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = i
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - i
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and n additional lists with two elements, x and y, where x is the number of 0's in a and y is the number of 1's in a, stdin is empty, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is S[-1][1] - S[i][1], rsum is n. If left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, either left * 2 is greater than or equal to lsum or right * 2 is greater than or equal to rsum, and the value of ans is updated to the value of i if the current value of i is closer to n/2 than the current value of ans.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and `n` additional lists with two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 0's in `a` and `y` is the number of 1's in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `left` is the number of 0's in `a`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the number of 1's in `a` minus the number of 1's up to index `i`, `rsum` is `n` minus `i`, `i` is 1. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped and `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the current value of `i` is closer to `n/2` than the current value of `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and `n` additional lists with two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 0's in `a` and `y` is the number of 1's in `a`, `left` is the number of 0's in `a` up to index `i`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the number of 1's in `a` minus the number of 1's up to index `i`, `rsum` is `n` minus `i`, `i` is 2, if `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n` divided by 2 and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n` divided by 2 and `ans`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
