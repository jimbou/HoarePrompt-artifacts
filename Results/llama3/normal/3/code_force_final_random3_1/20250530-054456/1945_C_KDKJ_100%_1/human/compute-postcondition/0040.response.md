Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and `n` additional lists with two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 0's in `a` and `y` is the number of 1's in `a`, `left` is the number of 0's in `a` up to index `i`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the number of 1's in `a` minus the number of 1's up to index `i`, `rsum` is `n` minus `i`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the same as before, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
