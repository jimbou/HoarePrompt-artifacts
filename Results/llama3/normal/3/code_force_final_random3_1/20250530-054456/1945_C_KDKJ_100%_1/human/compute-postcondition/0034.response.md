Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and `n` additional lists with two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 0's in `a` and `y` is the number of 1's in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `left` is the number of 0's in `a`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the number of 1's in `a` minus the number of 1's up to index `i`, `rsum` is `n` minus `i`, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to the value of `i` if the current value of `i` is closer to `n/2` than the current value of `ans`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
