Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and has at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and another list with two elements, `x` and `y`, where if `s` is 0, then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if `s` is 1, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, and another list with two elements, `x` and `y`, `s` is either 0 or 1, `x` is either 1 or 2, `y` is either 0 or 2, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `S` has been updated by appending another list containing the values of `x` and `y`, which depend on the value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
