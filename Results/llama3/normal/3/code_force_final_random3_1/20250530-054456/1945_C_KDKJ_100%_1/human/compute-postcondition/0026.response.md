Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and `n` additional lists with two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 0's in `a` and `y` is the number of 1's in `a`, `ans` is -1, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, `left` is 0, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n`, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.
