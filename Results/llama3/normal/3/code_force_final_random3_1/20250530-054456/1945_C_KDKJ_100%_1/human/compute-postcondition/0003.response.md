Output State: **`stdin` contains at least one more test case, the integer in the next test case is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5, the string in the next test case is a string of 0 and 1 with a length equal to the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed again.**

The function `func_1()` has been executed again, but the output state does not provide any information about the changes made by the function, as the function's behavior is not specified. Therefore, the output state only indicates that the function has been executed again, and the other conditions remain the same.
