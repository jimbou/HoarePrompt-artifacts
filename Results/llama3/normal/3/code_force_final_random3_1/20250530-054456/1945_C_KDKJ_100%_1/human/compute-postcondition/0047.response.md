Functionality: **This function reads two inputs from stdin: an integer n (n >= 3) and a string a of length n consisting only of 0 and 1. It then calculates the number of 0's and 1's in the string and finds the index i that is closest to n/2, considering the balance between the number of 0's and 1's on the left and right sides of the string. The function prints the value of i that satisfies this condition.**
