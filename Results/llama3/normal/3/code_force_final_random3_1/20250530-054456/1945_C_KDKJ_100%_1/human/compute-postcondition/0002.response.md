To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

1. **Variable `_`**: This is a throwaway variable, used to iterate over the range but not actually used within the loop body. Its value changes with each iteration but does not affect the loop's continuation directly.

2. **`int(input())`**: This is the key part that determines how many times the loop will run. It reads an integer from the standard input (`stdin`) and uses this integer as the upper limit for the range.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `stdin` contains at least one test case.
- The integer in the first test case is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5.
- The string in the first test case is a string of 0 and 1 with a length equal to the integer.
- The function `func_1()` has been executed.

For the loop to execute again, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its state doesn't need to be explicitly defined for the loop to continue.
- `stdin` must still contain at least one more test case for the loop to execute again. This means there needs to be another integer followed by another string.
- The integer in the next test case also needs to be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5, following the same constraints as before.
- The string in the next test case should be a string of 0 and 1, with a length equal to the new integer read from `stdin`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`stdin` contains at least one more test case, the integer in the next test case is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5, the string in the next test case is a string of 0 and 1 with a length equal to the integer, and the function `func_1()` is ready to be executed again.**
