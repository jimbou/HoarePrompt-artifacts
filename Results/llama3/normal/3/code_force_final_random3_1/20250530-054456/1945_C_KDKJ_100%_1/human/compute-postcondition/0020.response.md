Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and has at least 3 characters, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, another list with two elements, `x` and `y` are the last two elements of `S`, and `stdin` is empty. If `s` is '0', then `x` is either 2 or 3 and `y` is either 0 or 2. If `s` is not '0', then `x` is either 1 or 2 and `y` is either 1 or 3. `S` now contains an additional list with `x` and `y` as its elements.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and `a` remains the same. The list `S` now has an additional list as its last element, which contains the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` depend on the first character of the string `a`. If the first character is '0', then `x` is either 2 or 3 and `y` is either 0 or 2. If the first character is not '0', then `x` is either 1 or 2 and `y` is either 1 or 3. The `stdin` remains empty.
