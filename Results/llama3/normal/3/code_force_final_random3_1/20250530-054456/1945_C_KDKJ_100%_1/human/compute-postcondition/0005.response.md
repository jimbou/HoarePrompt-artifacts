Output State: **`stdin` contains at least one more test case, the integer in the next test case is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5, the string in the next test case is a string of 0 and 1 with a length equal to the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed again**

The code `func_1()` is executed again, but since we don't have the definition of this function, we can't determine its exact impact on the program. However, we can infer that the function has been executed again, and the state of the program remains the same as before, with the same conditions on the input in `stdin`.
