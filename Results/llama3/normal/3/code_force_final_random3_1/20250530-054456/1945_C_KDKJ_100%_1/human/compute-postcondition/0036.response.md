Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and `n` additional lists with two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 0's in `a` and `y` is the number of 1's in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `left` is the number of 0's in `a`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is the number of 1's in `a` minus the number of 1's up to index 1, `rsum` is `n` minus 1, `i` is 1. If the current value of `i` is closer to `n/2` than the current value of `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.***
