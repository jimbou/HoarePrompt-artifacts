You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer n (n >= 3) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and n additional lists with two elements, x and y, where x is the number of 0's in a and y is the number of 1's in a, and stdin is empty.
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = i
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - i
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and n additional lists with two elements, x and y, where x is the number of 0's in a and y is the number of 1's in a, stdin is empty, left is the number of 0's in a up to index n, lsum is n, right is the number of 1's in a minus the number of 1's up to index n, rsum is 0, i is n, ans is the value of i that is closest to n/2.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: the integer closest to n/2

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
