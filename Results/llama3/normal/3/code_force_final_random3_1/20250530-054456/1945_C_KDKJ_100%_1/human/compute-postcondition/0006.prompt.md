Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a string of 0 and 1. The integer is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5. The length of the string is equal to the integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains at least one test case, the integer in the first test case is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5, the string in the first test case is a string of 0 and 1 with a length equal to the integer, and the function func_1() has been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` contains at least one more test case, the integer in the next test case is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5, the string in the next test case is a string of 0 and 1 with a length equal to the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stdin` contains at least one more test case, the integer in the next test case is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5, the string in the next test case is a string of 0 and 1 with a length equal to the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed again




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
