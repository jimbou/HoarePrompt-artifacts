Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and has at least 3 characters, `S` is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and another list with two elements, `x` is either 1 or 2, `y` is either 1 or 3, `s` is either 0 or 1, `x` and `y` are the last two elements of `S`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
