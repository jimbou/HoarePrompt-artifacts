Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and n additional lists with two elements, x and y, where x is the number of 0's in a and y is the number of 1's in a, stdin is empty, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is S[-1][1] - S[i][1], rsum is n. If left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, either left * 2 is greater than or equal to lsum or right * 2 is greater than or equal to rsum, and the value of ans is updated to the value of i if the current value of i is closer to n/2 than the current value of ans.***
