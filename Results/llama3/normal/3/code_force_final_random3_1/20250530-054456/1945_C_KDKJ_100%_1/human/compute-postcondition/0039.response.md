Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, and n additional lists with two elements, x and y, where x is the number of 0's in a and y is the number of 1's in a, left is the number of 0's in a up to index i, lsum is i, right is the number of 1's in a minus the number of 1's up to index i, rsum is n minus i, i is 2, ans is the same as before**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `S`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state. The values of `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` are updated based on the new values of `i` and the contents of `S`. Specifically, `left` is now the number of 0's in `a` up to index `i`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the number of 1's in `a` minus the number of 1's up to index `i`, and `rsum` is `n` minus `i`.
