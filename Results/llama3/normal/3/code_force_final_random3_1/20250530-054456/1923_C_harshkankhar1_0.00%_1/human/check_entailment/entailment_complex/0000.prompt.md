Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple space-separated pairs of integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The first integer in the second line is a positive integer and the second integer is a non-negative integer. The list of integers are positive integers. The pairs of integers are positive integers such that the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of b is the (i-1)th element of b plus 1 if the ith element of a is greater than 1, otherwise it is the (i-1)th element of b plus 2.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... (where the list continues with the sum of the first i elements of the original list a, for i from 2 to n+1)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is 0, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of a is the sum of the first i elements of the original list a, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of b is the (i-1)th element of b plus 1 if the ith element of the original list a is greater than 1, otherwise it is the (i-1)th element of b plus 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, a positive integer q, a list of n+1 positive integers a, and q pairs of integers (x, y). It calculates the cumulative sum of the list a and prints it. Then, for each pair (x, y), it checks if the sum of the elements in the range [x, y] of the original list a is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the range [x, y] of the list b, which is calculated based on the values in the original list a. If the condition is met and x is not equal to y, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
