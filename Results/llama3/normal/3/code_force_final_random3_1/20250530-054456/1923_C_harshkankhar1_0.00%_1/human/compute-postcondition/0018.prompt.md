You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple space-separated pairs of integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The first integer in the second line is a positive integer and the second integer is a non-negative integer. The list of integers are positive integers. The pairs of integers are positive integers such that the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of b is the (i-1)th element of b plus 1 if the ith element of a is greater than 1, otherwise it is the (i-1)th element of b plus 2.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... (where the list continues with the sum of the first i elements of the original list a, for i from 2 to n+1)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is 0, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of a is the sum of the first i elements of the original list a, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of b is the (i-1)th element of b plus 1 if the ith element of the original list a is greater than 1, otherwise it is the (i-1)th element of b plus 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
