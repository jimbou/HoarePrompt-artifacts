Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, a positive integer q, a list of n+1 positive integers a, and q pairs of integers (x, y). It calculates the cumulative sum of the list a and prints it. Then, for each pair (x, y), it checks if the sum of the elements in the range [x, y] of the original list a is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the range [x, y] of the list b, which is calculated based on the values in the original list a. If the condition is met and x is not equal to y, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
