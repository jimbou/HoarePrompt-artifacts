stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple space-separated pairs of integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The first integer in the second line is a positive integer and the second integer is a non-negative integer. The list of integers are positive integers. The pairs of integers are positive integers such that the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
