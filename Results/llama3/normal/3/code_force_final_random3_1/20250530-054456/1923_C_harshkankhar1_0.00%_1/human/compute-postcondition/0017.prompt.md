Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0, and for all `i` from 2 to `n+1`, the `i`th element of `a` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the original list `a`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0, and for all `i` from 2 to `n+1`, the `i`th element of `b` is the (`i-1`)th element of `b` plus 1 if the `i`th element of the original list `a` is greater than 1, otherwise it is the (`i-1`)th element of `b` plus 2, and the list `a` is printed
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of a is the sum of the first i elements of the original list a, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of b is the (i-1)th element of b plus 1 if the ith element of the original list a is greater than 1, otherwise it is the (i-1)th element of b plus 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of a is the sum of the first i elements of the original list a, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of b is the (i-1)th element of b plus 1 if the ith element of the original list a is greater than 1, otherwise it is the (i-1)th element of b plus 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, and 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of a is the sum of the first i elements of the original list a, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, and for all i from 2 to n+1, the ith element of b is the (i-1)th element of b plus 1 if the ith element of the original list a is greater than 1, otherwise it is the (i-1)th element of b plus 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
