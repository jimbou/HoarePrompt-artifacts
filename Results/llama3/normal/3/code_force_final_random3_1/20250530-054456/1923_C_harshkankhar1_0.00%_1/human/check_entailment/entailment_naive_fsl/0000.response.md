Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of the corresponding prefix of the array b. In this case, the program should print 'NO', but it prints 'YES' instead.

For example, consider the input:

1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 5

The program will print 'YES', but the correct output is 'NO' because the subarray [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is not good.

The issue is in the line `print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')`. The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is not sufficient to determine whether the subarray is good. The program should also check whether the sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of the corresponding prefix of the array b.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check whether the sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of the corresponding prefix of the array b, and print 'NO' if it is.
