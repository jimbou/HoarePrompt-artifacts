Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0, b is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and multiple space-separated pairs of integers.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs to `n` and `q`, respectively. Since `n` is a positive integer and `q` is a positive integer, their values are updated accordingly. The second line assigns a list of `n+1` positive integers to `a`, where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the space-separated integers from the second input. The third line initializes a list `b` of `n+1` zeros. No other variables are affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and multiple space-separated pairs of integers.
