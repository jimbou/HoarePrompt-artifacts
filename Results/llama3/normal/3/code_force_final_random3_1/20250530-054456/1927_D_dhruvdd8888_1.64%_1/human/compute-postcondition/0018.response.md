Output: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is N, e is 0, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. The current value of ppp is 23, and the list of N+1 integers, nums, is being printed, where the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, and the last integer is -1.**
