Postcondition: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, l is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains one test case with two pairs of integers. The current value of s is greater than l. If s is equal to 1, then -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1, s is printed, where s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and s - 1 is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr minus 1.**
