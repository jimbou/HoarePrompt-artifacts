stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. The integer n is greater or equal than 2. The integers in the list are between 1 and 10^6. The integer q is greater or equal than 1. The pairs of integers are such that the first integer is less than the second integer and both are between 1 and n.
