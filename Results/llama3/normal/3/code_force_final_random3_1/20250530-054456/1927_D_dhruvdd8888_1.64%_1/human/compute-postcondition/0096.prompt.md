Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is N, e is 0, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. If ppp equals 23, the list of N+1 integers, nums, is printed, where the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, and the last integer is -1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, l is an integer, r is an integer, and stdin contains one test case with two pairs of integers. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed, otherwise s - 1, s is printed. If s is less than or equal to l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N, the value of s and e+1 are printed, otherwise -1, -1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, l is the first integer of the first test case, r is the second integer of the first test case, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, and stdin contains one test case with two pairs of integers. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1, s is printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N, then s, e + 1 is printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, l is the first integer of the second test case, r is the second integer of the second test case, and stdin contains one test case with one pair of integers. If s > l, then if s is 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N, the values of s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
