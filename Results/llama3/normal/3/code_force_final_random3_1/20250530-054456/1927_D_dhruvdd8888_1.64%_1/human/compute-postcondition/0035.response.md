Based on the precondition, the code prints the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`. 

The value of `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Since `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1, it must be at least 2.

Therefore, the value of `s - 1` will be at least 1.

Output: **at least 1, at least 2**
