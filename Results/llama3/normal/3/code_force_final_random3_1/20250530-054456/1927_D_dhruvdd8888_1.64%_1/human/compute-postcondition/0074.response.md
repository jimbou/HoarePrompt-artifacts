The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If the value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value returned by `int(input())` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, the value returned by `int(input())` must be at least 2.
State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, l is the first integer of the second test case, r is the second integer of the second test case, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, and stdin contains one test case with two pairs of integers. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1, s is printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N, then s, e + 1 is printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.**
