Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer N, a list of N integers, an integer q, and q pairs of integers. The function first processes the list of integers to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end indices of a subsequence of equal integers. Then, for each pair of integers (l, r), the function finds the corresponding subsequence and prints the start and end indices if the subsequence is within the range [l, r], or -1, -1 if not. If the current value of ppp is 23, the function also prints the list of N+1 integers.**
