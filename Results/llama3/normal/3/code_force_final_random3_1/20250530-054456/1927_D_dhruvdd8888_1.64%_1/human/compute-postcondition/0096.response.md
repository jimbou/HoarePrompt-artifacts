Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, l is the first integer of the last test case, r is the second integer of the last test case, and stdin is empty. If s > l, then if s is 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N, the values of s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The variable 's' now holds the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and 'e' holds the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr. The variable 'l' and 'r' hold the values of the first and second integers of the last test case, respectively. The stdin is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The output state also describes the conditions under which certain values are printed, based on the values of 's', 'l', 'e', and 'r'.
