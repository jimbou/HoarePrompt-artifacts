Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is the current value of nums[2], i is 2. If nums[2] is not equal to the previous value of num, then arr is a list containing a tuple (3, 2, the previous value of num), where s is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to the current value of `nums[2]`. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 2. The condition for `arr` is still dependent on the comparison between `nums[i]` (which is now `nums[2]`) and the previous value of `num`. If they are not equal, then `arr` is a list containing a tuple with the values (3, 2, the previous value of `num`). If they are equal, then no changes are made to `arr`. The values of `N` and `nums` remain unchanged.
