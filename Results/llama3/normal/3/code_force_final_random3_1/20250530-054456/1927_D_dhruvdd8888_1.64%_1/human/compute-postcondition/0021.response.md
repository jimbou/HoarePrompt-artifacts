Output State: **`N` is an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` is -1, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of `s`, previous value of `i`, previous value of `num`), `i` is `N`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains one test case with two pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` are integers, which are obtained from the input. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin now contains two pairs of integers.
