Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the list of N integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.**

Explanation:

*   The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to N. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer n, N will be equal to n. The precondition states that n is greater or equal to 2, so N will also be greater or equal to 2.
*   The second line reads a list of N integers from stdin and assigns it to nums. The precondition states that the integers in the list are between 1 and 10^6, so nums will be a list of N integers between 1 and 10^6.
*   The third line initializes s to 0. This variable is not used anywhere in the code snippet, so its value remains 0.
*   The fourth line initializes e to 0. Like s, this variable is not used anywhere in the code snippet, so its value remains 0.
*   The fifth line assigns the first integer in nums to num. Since nums is a list of N integers between 1 and 10^6, num will be an integer between 1 and 10^6.
*   The sixth line initializes arr to an empty list. This variable is not used anywhere in the code snippet, so its value remains an empty list.
*   The seventh line appends -1 to nums. This modifies the list nums by adding -1 to the end, so nums will now be a list of N+1 integers, where the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, and the last integer is -1.
*   After these lines are executed, stdin will contain one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.
