Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the list of N integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is the current value of nums[i], if the current value of nums[i] is equal to the first integer in the list of N integers, then s is 0, e is 0, arr is an empty list, i is 0, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. If the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the first integer in the list of N integers, then s is i, e is 0, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, the first integer in the list of N integers), i is 0, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` is the current value of `nums[1]`, `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` is not equal to `num`, then `arr` is a list containing a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)`, `s` is 1, `e` is unchanged, and stdin is unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is the current value of nums[2], i is 2. If nums[2] is not equal to the previous value of num, then arr is a list containing a tuple (3, 2, the previous value of num), where s is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
