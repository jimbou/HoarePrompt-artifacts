stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. The integer n is greater than 1, the list of n integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6, the integer q is greater than 0, and each pair of integers contains two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
