To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables.

The loop head is `for i in range(N + 1):`, which means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `N` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The state of `nums`, `num`, `arr`, `s`, `e`, and stdin remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`N` is an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` is the current value of `nums[1]`, `i` is 2**
