Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is the current value of nums[1], i is 2. If nums[i] is not equal to num, then arr is a list containing a tuple (1 + s, i, num), where s is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
