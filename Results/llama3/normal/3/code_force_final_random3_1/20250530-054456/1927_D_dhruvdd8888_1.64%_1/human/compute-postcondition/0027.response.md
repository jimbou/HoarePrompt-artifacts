Output State: **`N` is an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` is -1, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of `s`, previous value of `i`, previous value of `num`), `i` is `N`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and stdin contains one test case with two pairs of integers. The current value of `tc` is greater than 5. If `ppp` is 23, then the value of `l` and the value of `r` are printed. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes made to the variables. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration, without executing any additional code.
