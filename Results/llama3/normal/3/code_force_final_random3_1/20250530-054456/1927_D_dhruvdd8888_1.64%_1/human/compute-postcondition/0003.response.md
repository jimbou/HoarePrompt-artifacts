Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, s is i, e is 0, num is the first integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, num), i is 0, and the current value of nums[i] is not equal to num, stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the current value of `i`, which is 0. The list `arr` now contains a tuple with the values `(1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, num)`. The previous value of `s` is not specified, but it is known that `s` was 0 before the code executed. Therefore, the tuple in `arr` is `(1, 0, num)`. The value of `num` is still the first integer in the list of N integers. The value of `i` is still 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
