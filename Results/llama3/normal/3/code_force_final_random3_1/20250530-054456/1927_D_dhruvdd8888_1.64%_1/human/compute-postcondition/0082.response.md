Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the values of two variables: -1 and -1.

The first -1 is the value of the variable 'num', which is explicitly stated to be -1 in the precondition.

The second -1 is also the value of the variable 'num', which is again explicitly stated to be -1 in the precondition.

Therefore, the output will be two -1 values, separated by a space.

Output: **-1 -1**
