Output: **`N` is an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` is -1, `s` is the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of `s`, previous value of `i`, previous value of `num`), `i` is `N`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `_` is 1, `l` is the first integer of the first test case, `r` is the second integer of the first test case, and `stdin` contains one test case with two pairs of integers, and this is printed: the first integer of the first test case which is `l` and the second integer of the first test case which is `r`**
