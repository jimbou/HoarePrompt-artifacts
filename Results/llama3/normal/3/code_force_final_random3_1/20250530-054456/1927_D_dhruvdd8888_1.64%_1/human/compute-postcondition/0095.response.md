Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, l is the first integer of the second test case, r is the second integer of the second test case, and stdin contains one test case with one pair of integers. If s > l, then if s is 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N, the values of s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.***
