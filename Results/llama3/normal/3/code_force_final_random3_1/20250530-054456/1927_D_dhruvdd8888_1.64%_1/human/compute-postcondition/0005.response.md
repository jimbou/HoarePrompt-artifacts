Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is the current value of nums[i], if the current value of nums[i] is equal to the first integer in the list of N integers, then s is 0, e is 0, arr is an empty list, i is 0, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. If the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the first integer in the list of N integers, then s is i, e is 0, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, the first integer in the list of N integers), i is 0, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` is updated to the current value of `nums[i]`. If the current value of `nums[i]` is equal to the first integer in the list of N integers, then `s` and `e` remain 0, and `arr` remains an empty list. If the current value of `nums[i]` is not equal to the first integer in the list of N integers, then `s` is updated to `i`, and `arr` contains a tuple with the previous value of `s`, the previous value of `i`, and the first integer in the list of N integers. The values of `N`, `nums`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
