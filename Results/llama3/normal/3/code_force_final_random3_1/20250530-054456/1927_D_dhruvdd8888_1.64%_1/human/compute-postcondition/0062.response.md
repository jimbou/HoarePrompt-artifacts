The code prints the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`. 

`s` is the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Since `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `min(eli, LA)` will be the index of the last element in `arr` if `eli` is greater than or equal to `LA`, or `eli` if `eli` is less than `LA`. 

Since `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `(1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num)`, the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is `1 + previous value of s`. 

Therefore, `s` is `1 + previous value of s`. 

`s - 1` is `previous value of s`.

Output: **previous value of s, 1 + previous value of s**
