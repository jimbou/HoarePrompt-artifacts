Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is N, e is 0, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `N` remains unchanged, which is an integer greater or equal to 2.
*   The list `nums` remains unchanged, containing `N+1` integers, where the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, and the last integer is -1.
*   The value of `num` is updated to -1, which is the last integer in the list `nums`.
*   The value of `s` is updated to `N`, which is the last index of the list `nums`.
*   The value of `e` remains unchanged, which is 0.
*   The list `arr` is updated to contain tuples, where each tuple contains the updated values of `s`, `i`, and `num` from the previous iterations.
*   The value of `i` is updated to `N`, which is the last index of the list `nums`.
*   The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing one test case with three inputs: an integer `q`, and then `q` pairs of integers.
