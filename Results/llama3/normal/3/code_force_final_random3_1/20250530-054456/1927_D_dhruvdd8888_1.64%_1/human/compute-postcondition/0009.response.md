Output State: **`N` is an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` is the current value of `nums[1]`, `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` is not equal to `num`, then `arr` is a list containing a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)`, `s` is 1, `e` is unchanged, and stdin is unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` is updated to be the current value of `nums[1]`, which is the second element in the list `nums`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `arr`, `s`, and `e` are still dependent on whether `nums[1]` is equal to `num`.
