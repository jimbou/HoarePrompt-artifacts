Based on the precondition, let's analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `s` is the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of tuples, each containing `(1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num)`, the first element of each tuple is `1 + previous value of s`. Therefore, `s` is the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`, which is `1 + previous value of s`.
* `e` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Since each tuple contains `(1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num)`, the second element of each tuple is `previous value of i`. Therefore, `e` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`, which is `previous value of i`.
* `e + 1` is the result of adding 1 to the value of `e`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(s, e + 1)`

The print statement will print the values of `s` and `e + 1`.

Since `s` is the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`, which is `1 + previous value of s`, and `e` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`, which is `previous value of i`, the print statement will print the values of `1 + previous value of s` and `previous value of i + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(1 + previous value of s), (previous value of i + 1)**

Note that the exact values of `s` and `e` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `arr`, `eli`, and `LA`. However, based on the precondition, we can describe the output in terms of the relationships between the variables.
