Postcondition: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, if nums[i] is equal to num, then s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the list of N integers, arr is an empty list, i is 0, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. If nums[i] is not equal to num, then s is i, e is 0, num is the first integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, num), i is 0, and the current value of nums[i] is not equal to num, stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.**
