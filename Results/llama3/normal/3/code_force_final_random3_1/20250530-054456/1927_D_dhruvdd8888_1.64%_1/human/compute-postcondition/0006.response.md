To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state variables. The loop head is `for i in range(N + 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `N` is an integer greater or equal to 2.
- `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, with the first `N` integers between 1 and 10^6, and the last integer is -1.
- `num` is the current value of `nums[i]`.
- Depending on whether `num` equals the first integer in the list of `N` integers, `s`, `e`, `arr`, `i`, and `stdin` have different values.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we only consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`. 

Since `i` needs to be less than `N + 1` for the loop to execute again, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 (because it's either 0 or it was reset to 0 in the previous iteration based on the conditions given), for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`N` is an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` is the current value of `nums[i]`, `i` is 1, and the values of `s`, `e`, `arr`, and `stdin` depend on whether `num` equals the first integer in the list of `N` integers.**

Note: The exact values of `s`, `e`, `arr`, and `stdin` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `num` at `i=1`, but `i` is incremented to 1 to allow the loop to execute again.
