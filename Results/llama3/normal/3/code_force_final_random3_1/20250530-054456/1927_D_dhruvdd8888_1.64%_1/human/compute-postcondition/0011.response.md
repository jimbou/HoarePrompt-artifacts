Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is the current value of nums[1], i is 2, arr is a list containing a tuple (1 + s, i, num), s is 2**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains three values: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. Since `s` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a variable that is defined elsewhere in the code. The value of `1 + s` is calculated by adding 1 to the current value of `s`. The value of `i` is 2, and the value of `num` is the current value of `nums[1]`. The second line assigns the value of `i` to `s`, so `s` becomes 2.

After the code executes, the state of the variables is as follows: `N` remains an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` remains a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` remains the current value of `nums[1]`, `i` remains 2, `arr` is a list containing a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)`, and `s` is 2.
