Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is the current value of nums[i], i is 1. If nums[i] is not equal to num, then arr is a list containing a tuple (1 + s, i, num), s is 1, e is unchanged, and stdin is unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
