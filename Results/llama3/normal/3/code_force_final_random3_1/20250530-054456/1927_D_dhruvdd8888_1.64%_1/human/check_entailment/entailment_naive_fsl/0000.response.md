Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it uses a clever approach to solve the problem. It first creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end indices of a subarray with the same elements, along with the element itself. This is done by iterating through the input array and updating the start index whenever a new element is encountered.

Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the tuple that corresponds to the subarray that contains the query range. If the start index of the tuple is greater than the query range, it means that the query range is contained within a single subarray with the same elements, so it prints -1 -1. If the end index of the tuple is less than the query range, it means that the query range spans multiple subarrays with different elements, so it prints the start index of the tuple and the end index of the next tuple.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query range is contained within a single subarray with the same elements, or when the query range spans multiple subarrays with different elements. It also handles the case where the input array has a length of 1, in which case it prints -1 -1 for all queries.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n log n) for the binary search and O(n) for the iteration through the input array.
