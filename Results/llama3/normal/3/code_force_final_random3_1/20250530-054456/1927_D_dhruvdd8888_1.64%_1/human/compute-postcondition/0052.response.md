The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_` and the range of the loop is `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of the loop. If the range of the loop is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the range of the loop is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the range of the loop must be at least 2 and the loop variable `_` is 1.
State: **`N` is an integer greater or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, the first `N` integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, `num` is -1, `s` is the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of `s`, previous value of `i`, previous value of `num`), `i` is `N`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and `stdin` contains two test cases with two pairs of integers, `_` is 1**
