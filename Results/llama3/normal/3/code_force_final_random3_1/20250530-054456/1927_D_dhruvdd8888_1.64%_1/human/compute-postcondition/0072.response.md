Postcondition: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, l is the first integer of the first test case, r is the second integer of the first test case, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, and stdin contains one test case with two pairs of integers. If e is greater or equal to r, then -1 and -1 are printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N, then s and e + 1 are printed, where s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.**
