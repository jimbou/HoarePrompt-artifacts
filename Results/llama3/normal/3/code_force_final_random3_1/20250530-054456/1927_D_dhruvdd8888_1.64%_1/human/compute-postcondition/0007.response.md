Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is the current value of nums[i], i is 1, arr is a list containing a tuple (1 + s, i, num), s is 1, e is unchanged, and stdin is unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The first line appends a tuple containing `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Since `s` depends on whether `num` equals the first integer in the list of `N` integers, the value of `s` is either 0 or 1. Assuming `s` is 0 (as `num` is the current value of `nums[i]` and `i` is 1), the tuple becomes `(1, 1, num)`.
*   The second line assigns the value of `i` to `s`. Since `i` is 1, `s` becomes 1.

The values of `N`, `nums`, `num`, `e`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
