Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly processes multiple test cases from standard input, creates a list of tuples representing subsequences of equal integers, and then for each pair of integers (l, r), it finds the corresponding subsequence and prints the start and end indices if the subsequence is within the range [l, r], or -1, -1 if not. The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the start index of the subsequence is 1 or when the end index of the subsequence is equal to N. The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for the given input.
