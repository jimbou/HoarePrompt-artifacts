The code prints the value of `s` which is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and the value of `e + 1` where `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

Since the exact values of `s` and `e` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `s` and `e + 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values.

Output: **s (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr), e + 1 (where e is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
