You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. The integer n is greater or equal than 2. The integers in the list are between 1 and 10^6. The integer q is greater or equal than 1. The pairs of integers are such that the first integer is less than the second integer and both are between 1 and n.
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0

    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)

        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))

    #State: N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is N, e is 0, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.
    LA = len(arr) - 1

If ppp equals 23, the list of N+1 integers, nums, is printed, where the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, and the last integer is -1.

If s > l, then if s is 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N, the values of s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is N, e is 0, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, and stdin contains one test case with three inputs: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. The current value of ppp is 23, and the list of N+1 integers, nums, is being printed, where the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, and the last integer is -1.

Case_2: N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, l is the first integer of the last test case, r is the second integer of the last test case, and stdin is empty. If s > l, then if s is 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N, the values of s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
