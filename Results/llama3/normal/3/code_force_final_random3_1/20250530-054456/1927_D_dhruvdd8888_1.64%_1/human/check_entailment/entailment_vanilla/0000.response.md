Reasoning:  
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j for each query.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (tc) and then iterating over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array (N) and the array elements (nums).
3.  It initializes variables s (start) and e (end) to 0 and num to the first element of the array.
4.  It creates a list (arr) to store the start and end indices of segments with the same value in the array.
5.  It iterates over the array, and whenever it encounters a different value, it appends the start and end indices of the current segment to the list (arr).
6.  It reads the number of queries (q) and then iterates over each query.
7.  For each query, it uses binary search (bisect_left) to find the index (eli) in the list (arr) where the left boundary of the query (l) should be inserted to maintain sorted order.
8.  It retrieves the start and end indices (s, e) of the segment from the list (arr) at index eli.
9.  If the start index (s) is greater than the left boundary (l), it checks if the start index is 1. If it is, it prints -1 -1, indicating that no pair of different elements exists in the query range. Otherwise, it prints the previous index (s - 1) and the start index (s).
10. If the end index (e) is greater than or equal to the right boundary (r), it prints -1 -1, indicating that no pair of different elements exists in the query range.
11. If the end index (e) is less than the length of the array (N), it prints the start index (s) and the next index (e + 1).
12. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints -1 -1.
