Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two different elements in a given range of an array. The program first processes the input array to find the ranges of identical elements and stores these ranges in the `arr` list. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the range that contains the left boundary of the query. If the left boundary is within this range, it checks if the right boundary is also within the same range. If it is, it prints -1, -1, indicating that no two different elements exist in the query range. If the right boundary is not within the same range, it prints the first element of the current range and the first element of the next range, which are guaranteed to be different.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the left boundary is at the start of the array or when the right boundary is at the end of the array. It also handles the case where the query range spans multiple ranges of identical elements.

The use of binary search to find the range that contains the left boundary of the query is efficient, with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of ranges of identical elements. This makes the program efficient for large inputs.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient in solving the problem.
