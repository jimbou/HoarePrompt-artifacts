Output State: **N is an integer greater or equal to 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, the first N integers are between 1 and 10^6, the last integer is -1, num is -1, s is the value of the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, arr is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (1 + previous value of s, previous value of i, previous value of num), i is N, LA is the length of arr minus 1, l is the first integer of the first test case, r is the second integer of the first test case, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, and stdin contains one test case with two pairs of integers.**

The code executes the following operations:

1.  It calculates the insertion point `eli` for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr` using the `bisect_left` function. This operation does not modify any variables but assigns the calculated insertion point to `eli`.
2.  It assigns the values of the first, second, and third elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` to `s`, `e`, and `_` respectively. This operation updates the values of `s` and `e` based on the values in `arr`.

The final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with the values of `s` and `e` updated based on the values in `arr`. The value of `eli` is also included in the final state, representing the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.
