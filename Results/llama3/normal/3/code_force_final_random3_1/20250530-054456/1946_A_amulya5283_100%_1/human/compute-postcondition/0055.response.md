Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.***
