Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If n is 1, 1 is being printed. If n is greater than 1, the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in a from index mdx to n-1 is being printed.**
