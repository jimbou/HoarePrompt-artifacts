Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, t's original value is at least 3, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If n is 1, 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is at least 1 and less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and the value of res is being printed, where res is 0, and mdx is equal to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mdx, n):
    if a[mdx] == a[i]:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, and `res` is 1 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
