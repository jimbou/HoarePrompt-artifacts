Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, mdx is equal to n, i is equal to n, res is equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in a from index mdx to n-1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is still a sorted list of `n` integers, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The loop variable `mdx` has reached the end of the list `a` (i.e., `mdx` is equal to `n`), and the loop counter `i` has also reached the end of the list `a` (i.e., `i` is equal to `n`). The variable `res` now holds the total count of occurrences of the value `a[mdx]` in the list `a` from index `mdx` to the end of the list (`n-1`).
