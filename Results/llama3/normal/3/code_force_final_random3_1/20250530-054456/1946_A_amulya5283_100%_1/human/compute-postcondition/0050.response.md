To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(mdx, n):`

The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx`, and `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `mdx + 1`.

The state of `mdx` and `n` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`, and `res` is 1 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains 0.**
