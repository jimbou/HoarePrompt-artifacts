Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, `res` is 1, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `res` being equal to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a[mdx]` and `a[i]` is still maintained, as `i` is equal to `mdx`. The input state and the properties of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `mdx` are preserved.
