Output State: **t is 0, stdin contains no test cases. If n is 1, 1 is printed for each test case with n equal to 1. If n is not 1, the number of times a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for i in range(mdx, n) is printed for each test case with n not equal to 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases have been read and processed. For each test case, if `n` is 1, the number 1 will be printed. If `n` is not 1, the number of times `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]` for `i` in the range `[mdx, n)` will be printed.
