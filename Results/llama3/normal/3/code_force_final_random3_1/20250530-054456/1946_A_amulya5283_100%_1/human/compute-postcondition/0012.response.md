The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mdx and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `mdx` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mdx`, `mdx` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `mdx+1` and for the loop to execute again `mdx` must be less than `n` and `n` must be greater than `mdx+1`. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer greater than `mdx+1`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is `mdx+1`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
