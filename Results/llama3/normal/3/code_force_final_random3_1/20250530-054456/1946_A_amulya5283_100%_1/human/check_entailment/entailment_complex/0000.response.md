Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3.  It sorts the array `a` in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
4.  If `n` is 1, it correctly prints 1, because increasing the only element in the array will always increase the median.
5.  If `n` is not 1, it calculates the median index `mdx` correctly using the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula works because in Python, the `//` operator performs integer division (i.e., it rounds down to the nearest whole number), and the `+ n % 2 - 1` part adjusts the index to be the first element of the second half of the array when `n` is even.
6.  It then counts the number of times the median element appears in the second half of the sorted array by iterating from `mdx` to the end of the array and checking if each element is equal to the median element. This is correct because increasing the median element will increase the median if and only if there are other elements in the second half of the array that are equal to the median element.
7.  Finally, it prints the count, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Correctness: **True**
