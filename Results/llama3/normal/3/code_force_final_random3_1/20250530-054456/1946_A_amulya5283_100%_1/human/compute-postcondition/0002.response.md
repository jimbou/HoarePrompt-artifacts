Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, but it remains greater than 0. The value of `n` is now a positive integer, which was read from the first line of the current test case in stdin. The list `a` contains `n` integers, which were read from the second line of the current test case in stdin, and these integers are now sorted in ascending order. Stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the code.
