Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `res` is 1, `mdx` is less than `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is still a sorted list of `n` integers, `mdx` is still less than `n`, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is still equal to `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is still equal to the current value of `a[i]`.
