Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `res` is 1, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `res` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original properties and relationships.
