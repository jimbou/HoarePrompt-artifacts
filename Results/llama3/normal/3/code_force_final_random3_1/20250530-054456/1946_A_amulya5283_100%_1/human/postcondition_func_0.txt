This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then sorts the integers and, for each test case, prints the number of times the middle element (or the element just after the middle if n is even) appears in the second half of the sorted list. If n is 1, it simply prints 1. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
