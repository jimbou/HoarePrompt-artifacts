Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2`, `res` is either 3 or 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still one less than its original value and its original value is at least 3. The value of `n` is still a positive integer. The list `a` is still sorted and contains `n` integers. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still multiple but minus three. The value of `mdx` is still at least 1 and less than `n`. The value of `i` is still equal to `mdx + 2`. The value of `res` is either 3 or 2, depending on whether `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.
