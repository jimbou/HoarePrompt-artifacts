The code prints the value of `res`.
`res` is either equal to the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a` or less than the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a`, depending on whether `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[mdx, n)`.
Output: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the value of `res` is being printed, where `res` is either equal to the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a` or less than the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a`**
