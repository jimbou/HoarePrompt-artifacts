The `print(res)` statement will print the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1`.

Since `mdx` is equal to `n`, and `i` is also equal to `n`, it means that we are considering the last element of the list `a` (at index `n-1`).

The value of `res` is the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` (which is the last element of the list `a`) in the sublist of `a` from index `mdx` (which is `n`) to `n-1`. Since `mdx` is equal to `n`, this sublist only contains the last element of `a`.

Therefore, the value of `res` is 1, because the last element of `a` occurs only once in the sublist.

Output: **1**
