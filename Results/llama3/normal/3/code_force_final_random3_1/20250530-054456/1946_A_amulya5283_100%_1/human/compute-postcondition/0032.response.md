Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer and is greater than `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`, `res` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0 and is still two less than its original value. The value of `n` remains a positive integer and is still greater than `mdx + 1`. The list `a` remains sorted and contains `n` integers. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains multiple minus two. The value of `mdx` remains at least 1 and less than `n`. The value of `i` remains equal to `mdx + 1`. The value of `res` has been increased by 1.
