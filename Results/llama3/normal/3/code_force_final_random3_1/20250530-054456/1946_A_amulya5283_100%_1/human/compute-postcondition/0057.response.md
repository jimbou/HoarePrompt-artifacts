The code prints the value of `res`, which is the number of times `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]` for `i` in the range from `mdx` to `n-1` (since `i` is equal to `n-1`).

Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `a[mdx]` is an integer in the sorted list.

The value of `res` depends on the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the sublist of `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]` for all `i` in this range, then `res` will be equal to the length of this sublist, which is `n - mdx`. If `a[mdx]` is not equal to `a[i]` for some `i` in this range, then `res` will be less than `n - mdx`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `mdx`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the specified range of the sorted list `a`.

Output: **the number of times a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for i in range(mdx, n) (where a[mdx] is an integer in the sorted list a, and the range is from mdx to n-1)**
