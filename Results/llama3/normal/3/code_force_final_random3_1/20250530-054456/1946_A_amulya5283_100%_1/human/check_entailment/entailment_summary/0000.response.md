Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. 

Here's why:

- The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
- It sorts the array in ascending order.
- If the length of the array is 1, it prints 1 because only one operation is required to increase the median (which is the only element in the array).
- If the length of the array is more than 1, it calculates the index of the median (mdx) and then counts the number of times the median appears in the second half of the sorted array (including the median itself). This is because we need to increase all these elements to increase the median. The program prints this count.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
