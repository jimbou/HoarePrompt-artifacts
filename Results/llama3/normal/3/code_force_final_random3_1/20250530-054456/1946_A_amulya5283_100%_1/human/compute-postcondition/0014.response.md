Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer greater than `mdx+1`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is `mdx+1`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
