To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `mdx` is less than `n`. Since `mdx` is the integer division of `n` by 2 plus the remainder of `n` divided by 2 minus 1, we can infer that `mdx` is at least 1 and at most `n-1`.

To guarantee the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `mdx` to be at least 1 and less than `n`. We also need to adjust the state of `i` to be equal to `mdx` at the start of the loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `res` is 0, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`**
