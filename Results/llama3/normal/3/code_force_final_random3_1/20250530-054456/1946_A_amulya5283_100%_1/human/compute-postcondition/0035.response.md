Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer and is greater than `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2, `res` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `t` and its original value, `n` and `mdx`, and the properties of `a` and `stdin` are still valid.
