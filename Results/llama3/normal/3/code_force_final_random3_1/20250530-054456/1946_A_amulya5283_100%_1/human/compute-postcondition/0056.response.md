Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, t's original value is at least 3, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, mdx is at least 1 and less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and the value of res is being printed, where res is the number of times a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for i in range(mdx, n).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished iterating over the range from mdx to n, and the value of res is the total count of times a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for all i in that range. The other variables remain unchanged, with t still being one less than its original value, n still being a positive integer, a still being a sorted list of n integers, and stdin still containing multiple test cases minus three test cases.
