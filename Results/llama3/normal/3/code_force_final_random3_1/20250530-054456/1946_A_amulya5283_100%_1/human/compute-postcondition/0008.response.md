The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mdx, and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `mdx` and `n`. If mdx is less than n, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of n integers, res is 0, mdx is a non-negative integer less than n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to mdx is less than n and i is now mdx.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of n integers, res is 0, mdx is less than n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, i is mdx**
