Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, t's original value is at least 3, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If n is 1, 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is at least 1 and less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and the value of res is being printed, where res is 0, and mdx is equal to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1.**
