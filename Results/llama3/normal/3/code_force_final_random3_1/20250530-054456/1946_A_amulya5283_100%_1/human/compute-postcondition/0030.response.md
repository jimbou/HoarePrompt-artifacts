Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`.**
