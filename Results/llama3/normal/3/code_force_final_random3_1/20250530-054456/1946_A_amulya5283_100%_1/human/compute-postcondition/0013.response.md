Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer greater than `mdx+1`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is `mdx+1`, `res` is 1 if the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, otherwise `res` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is now 1 regardless of whether the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]` or not.
