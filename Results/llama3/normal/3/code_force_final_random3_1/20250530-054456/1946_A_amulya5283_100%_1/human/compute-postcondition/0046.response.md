To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `mdx` and `n`. If `mdx` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, we know that `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, and `i` is equal to `n - 1`. However, for the loop to execute, `i` should be equal to `mdx`, not `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be equal to `mdx`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, and `res` is 0**
