Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, t's original value is at least 3, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If n is 1, 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is at least 1 and less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and the value of res is being printed, where res is either equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) of a or less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) of a**

The first line decrements `t` by 1, making it one less than its original value. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, making it a positive integer. The third line assigns a sorted list of `n` integers to `a`, making it a sorted list of `n` integers. The fourth line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. 

The value of `t` is still greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, and `t`'s original value is still at least 3. The value of `n` is a positive integer. The list `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers. The value of `stdin` is now multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `n` is 1, 1 is printed. Otherwise, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the value of `res` is being printed, where `res` is either equal to the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a` or less than the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a`.
