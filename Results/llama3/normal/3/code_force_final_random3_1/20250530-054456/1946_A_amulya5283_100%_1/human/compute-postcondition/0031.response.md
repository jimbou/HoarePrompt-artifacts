The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mdx and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx`, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `mdx + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer and is greater than `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1**
