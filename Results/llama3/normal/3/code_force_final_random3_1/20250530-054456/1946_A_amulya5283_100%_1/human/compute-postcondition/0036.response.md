Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer and is greater than `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is increased by 1.***
