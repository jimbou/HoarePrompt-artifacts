Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n`.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        res = 0
        mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
        for i in range(mdx, n):
            if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                res += 1
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If n is 1, 1 is being printed. If n is greater than 1, the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in a from index mdx to n-1 is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If n is 1, 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is at least 1 and less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and the value of res is being printed, where res is either equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) of a or less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) of a
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, t's original value is at least 3, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If n is 1, 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is at least 1 and less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and the value of res is being printed, where res is either equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) of a or less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) of a. If n is 1, 1 is printed. If n is not 1, the number of times a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for i in range(mdx, n) is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
