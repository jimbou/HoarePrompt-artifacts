According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**
