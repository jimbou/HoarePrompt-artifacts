Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[mdx, n)`, then `res` is equal to the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a`. Otherwise, `res` is less than the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` remains two less than its original value, `n` is still a positive integer, `a` is still a sorted list of `n` integers, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The loop variable `i` has reached the end of the loop, which is `n - 1`. The value of `res` depends on the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` of `a`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[mdx, n)`, then `res` is equal to the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in that range. Otherwise, `res` is less than the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in that range.
