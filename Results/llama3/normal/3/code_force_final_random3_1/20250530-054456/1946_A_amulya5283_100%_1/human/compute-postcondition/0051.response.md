Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `t`'s original value is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `mdx` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`, and `res` is 2 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `res` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be 2 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
