Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer greater than `mdx+2`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is `mdx+2`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is now 2. Otherwise, `res` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
