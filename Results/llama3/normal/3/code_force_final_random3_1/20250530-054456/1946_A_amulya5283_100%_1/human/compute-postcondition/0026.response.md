Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, res is 0, mdx is the integer division of n by 2 plus the remainder of n divided by 2 minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is still a sorted list of `n` integers, as the code does not alter it. The number of test cases in stdin is still multiple, minus two test cases, as the code does not affect the input. The variable `res` is initialized to 0, and the variable `mdx` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2, plus the remainder of `n` divided by 2, minus 1.
