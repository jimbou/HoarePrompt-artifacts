Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If n is 1, 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is at least 1 and less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and the value of res is being printed, where res is either equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) of a or less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) of a***
