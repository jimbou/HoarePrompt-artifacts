Output State: **i is 1, l is a positive integer, s is a list of l integers where each element is equal to the number of times the corresponding index appeared in array, array is a list of l integers, ans is a string containing l characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s, j is the last element in array, and the string ans is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` remains 1, `l` remains a positive integer, the list `s` now contains the count of each index in the `array` list, the `array` list remains the same, the string `ans` contains `l` characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s`, and `j` is the last element in `array`. The string `ans` is printed.
