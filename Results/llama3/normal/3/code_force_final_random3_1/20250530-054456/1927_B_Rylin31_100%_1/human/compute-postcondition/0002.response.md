To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the list `array`. The loop will execute if `array` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `array` to have at least one element.

State: **`i` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is the first element in `array`**
