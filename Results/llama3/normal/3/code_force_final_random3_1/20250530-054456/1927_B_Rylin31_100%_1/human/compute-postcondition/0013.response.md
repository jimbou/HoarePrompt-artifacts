To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `array`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `array`. If the `array` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `j` is the last element in `array`, we need to adjust the state of `array` to have at least 1 element, and `j` should be the first element in `array` for the loop to start.

State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of `l` integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is the first element in `array`**
