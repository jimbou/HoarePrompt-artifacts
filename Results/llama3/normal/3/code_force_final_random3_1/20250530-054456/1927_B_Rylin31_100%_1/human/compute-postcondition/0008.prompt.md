Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 0, l is a positive integer, s is a list of l zeros, array is a list of integers, ans is an empty string, stdin contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, l is a positive integer, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 1 and all other elements are 0, array is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a string containing the character 'a', stdin contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, j is the first element in array

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 0, l is a positive integer, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 2 and all other elements are 0, array is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a string containing the character 'a' followed by the character 'b', j is the second element in array, stdin contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 0, l is a positive integer, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 3 and all other elements are 0, array is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, ans is a string containing the character 'a', the character 'b', and the character 'c', j is the third element in array, stdin contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
