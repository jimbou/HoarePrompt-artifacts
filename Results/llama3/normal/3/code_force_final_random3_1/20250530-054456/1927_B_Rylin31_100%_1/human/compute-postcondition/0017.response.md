To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in array:`. The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `array`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `array`. If the `array` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `array` has at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in `array`.

For the loop to execute again, `array` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` must be the third element in `array`.

The other variables `i`, `l`, `s`, and `ans` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where the jth element is 2 and all other elements are 0, `array` is a list of `l` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is a string containing two characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s` and 97 plus the new value of the jth element in `s`, `j` is the third element in `array`**
