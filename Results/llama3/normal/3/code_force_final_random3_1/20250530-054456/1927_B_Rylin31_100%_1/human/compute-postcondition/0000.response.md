The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `input()`. If input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains a series of test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains a series of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `i` is 0**
