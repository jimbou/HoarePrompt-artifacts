Output State: **i is 1, l is a positive integer, s is a list of l zeros, array is a list of l integers, ans is an empty string, stdin contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, j is the last element in array, and the string ans is printed**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `l` is updated to a positive integer, which is the input provided by the user. The list `s` is initialized with `l` zeros, replacing its previous value. The list `array` is updated with a new list of `l` integers, which are the inputs provided by the user. The string `ans` is reset to an empty string, and the last element in `array` is assigned to `j`. The string `ans` is printed, but its value remains an empty string. The stdin now contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
