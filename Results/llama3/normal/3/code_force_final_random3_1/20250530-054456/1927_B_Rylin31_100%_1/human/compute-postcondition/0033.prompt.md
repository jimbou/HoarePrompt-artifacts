Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, l is a positive integer, s is a list of l integers where each element is equal to the number of times its index appears in array, array is an empty list, ans is a string containing the characters 'a' through 'z' repeated a number of times equal to the number of times each index appears in array, stdin contains a series of test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, j is the last element in array, and the string ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, l is a positive integer, s is a list of l integers where each element is equal to the number of times the corresponding index appeared in array, array is a list of l integers, ans is a string containing l characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s, j is the last element in array, and the string ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 2, l is a positive integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is equal to the number of times the jth element of array appears in array and the rest are 0, array is a list of l integers from the input, ans is a string containing the characters 'a' through 'z' repeated for each element in array, j is the last element of array, and the string ans containing the characters 'a' through 'z' repeated for each element in array is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
