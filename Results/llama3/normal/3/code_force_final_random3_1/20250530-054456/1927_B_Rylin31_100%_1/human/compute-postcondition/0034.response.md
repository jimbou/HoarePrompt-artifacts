Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then generates a string by iterating over the list of integers, where each integer corresponds to a character in the alphabet (with 'a' corresponding to 0, 'b' to 1, and so on). The function repeats this process for each test case, printing the resulting string for each case. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the results directly to standard output.**
