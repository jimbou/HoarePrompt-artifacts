To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `array`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `array`. If the `array` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `j` is not defined before the loop, it will be assigned the first element of `array` at the start of the loop.

State: **`i` is 2, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of `l` integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string, `j` is the first element of `array`, stdin contains no input**
