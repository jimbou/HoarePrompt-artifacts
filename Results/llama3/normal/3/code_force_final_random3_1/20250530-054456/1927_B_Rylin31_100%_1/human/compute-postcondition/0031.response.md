The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`, which contains the characters 'a' through 'z' repeated for each element in the `array`.

Since `array` is a list of `l` integers from the input, and `ans` is a string containing the characters 'a' through 'z' repeated for each element in `array`, the length of `ans` will be equal to the sum of the elements in `array`.

For example, if `array` is `[3, 2, 1]`, then `ans` will be a string of length `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`, containing the characters 'a' through 'z' repeated for each element in `array`.

Output: **a string of length equal to the sum of the elements in array, containing the characters 'a' through 'z' repeated for each element in array**
