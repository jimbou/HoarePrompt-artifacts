The code `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to 10^6. This means that the interpreter can now handle recursive calls up to a depth of 10^6.

Output State: **The maximum recursion limit is set to 10^6, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n and m, followed by m lines, each containing three integers u, v, and w. n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). u, v, and w are integers such that 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6.**
