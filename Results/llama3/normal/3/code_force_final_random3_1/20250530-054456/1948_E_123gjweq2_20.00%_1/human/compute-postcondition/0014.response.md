Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right is at least left and right - left is even, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of integers with length at least right + 1, arr[left + i] is equal to left + mid + i for all i from 0 to right - left, cliquess[left + i] is equal to clique for all i from 0 to right - left, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is 0, i is not_mid, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, `cliquess`, `small_element`, `big_element`, and `mid` remain unchanged. The value of `not_mid` is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `i` is equal to `not_mid`, which is 0. The values of `arr[left + mid + i]` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` are updated to `big_element - i` and `clique`, respectively, for all `i` from 0 to `not_mid`.
