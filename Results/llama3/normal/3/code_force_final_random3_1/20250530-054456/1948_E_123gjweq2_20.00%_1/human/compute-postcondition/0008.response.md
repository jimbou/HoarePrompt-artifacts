To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the expression `not_mid`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `not_mid` is defined as `right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`, we can simplify it to `(right - left + 1) % 2`. This means that `not_mid` will be 1 if `(right - left + 1)` is odd.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `not_mid` to be at least 1. We can do this by making `(right - left + 1)` odd. One way to achieve this is to make `right - left` even.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we need to initialize it to 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `right` is at least `left` and `right - left` is even, `clique` is a positive integer, `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of integers with length at least `right + 1`, `arr[left + i]` is equal to `left + mid + i` for all `i` from 0 to `right - left`, `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique` for all `i` from 0 to `right - left`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `not_mid` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
