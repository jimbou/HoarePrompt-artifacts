Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right is at least left and right - left is even, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of integers with length at least right + 1, arr[left + i] is equal to left + mid + i for all i from 0 to right - left, cliquess[left + i] is equal to clique for all i from 0 to right - left, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is at least 1, i is 1, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique.**

The provided code snippet does not modify any variables or their values. The two lines of code are simply reassigning the same values to `arr[left + mid + i]` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` that they already had, based on the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
