Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem requires assigning distinct integers to each vertex in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. The program achieves this by dividing the vertices into segments of size k and assigning the integers in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

The function `make_array` is used to assign the integers to the vertices in each segment. It assigns the integers in a way that the difference between the integers assigned to two vertices is at most k, which ensures that the vertices are connected and form a clique.

The program then prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques. The output matches the expected output format.

Correctness: **True**
