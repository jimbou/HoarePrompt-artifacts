Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program assigns distinct integers to each vertex, and the assignment is done in a way that minimizes the number of cliques. The program also correctly partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

The program uses a greedy approach to assign integers to vertices. It first calculates the number of cliques needed, which is the ceiling of n/k. Then, it assigns integers to vertices in a way that minimizes the number of cliques. The assignment is done in a way that the difference between the assigned integers is minimized, which ensures that the number of cliques is minimized.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when n is less than or equal to k. In this case, the program assigns integers to vertices in a way that all vertices are in the same clique.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program handles all possible inputs and edge cases correctly, and the output is always correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
