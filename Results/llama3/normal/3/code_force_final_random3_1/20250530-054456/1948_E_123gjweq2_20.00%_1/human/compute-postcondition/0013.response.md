Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right is at least left and right - left is even, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of integers with length at least right + 1, arr[left + i] is equal to left + mid + i for all i from 0 to right - left, cliquess[left + i] is equal to clique for all i from 0 to right - left, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is at least 2, i is 2, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique.**

The provided code snippet does not modify any variables or their values. The first line assigns the value of `big_element - i` to `arr[left + mid + i]`, but since `arr[left + mid + i]` is already `big_element - i` as per the initial state, this line does not change the value of `arr[left + mid + i]`. Similarly, the second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`, but since `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is already `clique` as per the initial state, this line also does not change the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
