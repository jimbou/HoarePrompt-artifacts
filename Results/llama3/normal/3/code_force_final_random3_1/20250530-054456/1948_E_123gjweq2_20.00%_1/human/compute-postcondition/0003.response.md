To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and `mid`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly given, but we know that `mid` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, and `mid` must remain greater than the new value of `i`. Since `i` is not explicitly given, we can't determine its exact value, but we know it must be less than `mid`.

State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right is at least left + 1, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of integers with length at least right + 1, arr[left + i] is equal to left + 1 + i for all i from 0 to right - left, cliquess[left + i] is equal to clique for all i from 0 to right - left, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than i + 1, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is greater than 0**
