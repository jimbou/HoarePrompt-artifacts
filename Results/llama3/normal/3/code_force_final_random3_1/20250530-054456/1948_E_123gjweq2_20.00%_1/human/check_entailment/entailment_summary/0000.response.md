Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques required, which is the ceiling of `n` divided by `k`. It then creates a list `arr` to store the assigned integers and a list `cliquess` to store the clique assignments for each vertex.

Function `make_array` is used to populate the `arr` and `cliquess` lists. It takes a range defined by `left` and `right` indices and a clique number as input. It assigns values to `arr` in a specific pattern, starting from `left + 1` and incrementing up to `right + 1`, while assigning a constant value `clique` to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`.

The program prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each vertex.

Based on the execution summaries, the program correctly implements the required logic. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of cliques and creates the necessary lists. The `make_array` function correctly populates the lists with the required values.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
