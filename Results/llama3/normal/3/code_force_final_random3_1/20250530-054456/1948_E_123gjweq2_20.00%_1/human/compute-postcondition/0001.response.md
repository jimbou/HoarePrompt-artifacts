According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mid`. If `mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, which may or may not be greater than 0. To ensure the loop can execute, `mid` must be greater than 0.

Since `mid` is defined as `(right - left + 1) // 2`, we can deduce that `right - left + 1` must be at least 2 for `mid` to be greater than 0. This means `right` must be at least `left + 1`.

The other variables in the state, such as `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, `cliquess`, `small_element`, `big_element`, and `not_mid`, do not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `right` is at least `left + 1`, `clique` is a positive integer, `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of integers with length at least `right + 1`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is greater than 0, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`**
