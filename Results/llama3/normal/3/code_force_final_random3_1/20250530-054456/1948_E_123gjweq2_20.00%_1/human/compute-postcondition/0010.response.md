To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid):`, so we can only adjust the state of `i` and `not_mid`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `not_mid` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `not_mid` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `right` is at least `left` and `right - left` is even, `clique` is a positive integer, `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of integers with length at least `right + 1`, `arr[left + i]` is equal to `left + mid + i` for all `i` from 0 to `right - left`, `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique` for all `i` from 0 to `right - left`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `not_mid` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`**
