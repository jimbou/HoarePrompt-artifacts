Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right is at least left, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of integers with length at least right + 1, arr[left + i] is equal to left + mid + i for all i from 0 to right - left, cliquess[left + i] is equal to clique for all i from 0 to right - left, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than or equal to 0, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the values of `arr` and `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are updated to be `left + mid + i` and `clique` respectively, where `i` ranges from 0 to `right - left`. The values of `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged. The loop has finished executing, so `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, and `not_mid` is still `right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`.
