The function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the ceiling of n divided by k and creates a list of n values, where each segment of k values is filled with the same number, starting from 1 and incrementing for each segment. The function then prints this list, followed by the ceiling of n divided by k, and finally a list of n zeros. The function does not return any value.
