The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, `mid` is greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is greater than 1 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than `i + 1` so `mid` is greater than 2.
State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right is at least left + 1, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of integers with length at least right + 1, arr[left + i] is equal to left + 2 + i for all i from 0 to right - left, cliquess[left + i] is equal to clique for all i from 0 to right - left, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2, i is greater than 1**
