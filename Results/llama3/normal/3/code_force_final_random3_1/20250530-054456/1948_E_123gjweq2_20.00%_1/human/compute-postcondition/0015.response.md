Functionality: **This function modifies two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, within a specified range defined by `left` and `right` indices. It assigns values to `arr` in a specific pattern, starting from `left + 1` and incrementing up to `right + 1`, while assigning a constant value `clique` to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. The function effectively populates a segment of the lists with a sequence of numbers and a constant value, respectively.**
