Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to each vertex in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required based on the input parameters `n` and `k`. It then initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique assignments for each vertex, respectively.

The `make_array` function is used to assign integers to the vertices in a way that minimizes the number of cliques. It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. The `left` and `right` parameters represent the range of vertices to be assigned, and the `clique` parameter represents the clique assignment for these vertices.

The `make_array` function first calculates the midpoint of the range and assigns the smaller half of the range to the lower half of the vertices and the larger half of the range to the upper half of the vertices. This is done to minimize the number of cliques by ensuring that vertices with similar values are assigned to the same clique.

The `func_1` function then calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the appropriate range and clique assignment. Finally, it prints the assigned integers and clique assignments for each vertex.

Based on the provided problem description and the code, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the number of cliques required and assigns integers to the vertices in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

Correctness: **True**
