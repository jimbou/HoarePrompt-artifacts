To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid):`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `right` is at least `left` and `right - left` is even.
* `clique` is a positive integer.
* `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of integers with length at least `right + 1`.
* `arr[left + i]` is equal to `left + mid + i` for all `i` from 0 to `right - left`.
* `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique` for all `i` from 0 to `right - left`.
* `small_element` is `left + 1`.
* `big_element` is `right + 1`.
* `mid` is greater than or equal to 0.
* `not_mid` is at least 1.
* `i` is 1.
* `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i`.
* `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop head `for i in range(not_mid):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is currently 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `right` is at least `left` and `right - left` is even, `clique` is a positive integer, `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of integers with length at least `right + 1`, `arr[left + i]` is equal to `left + mid + i` for all `i` from 0 to `right - left`, `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique` for all `i` from 0 to `right - left`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is greater than or equal to 0, `not_mid` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`**
