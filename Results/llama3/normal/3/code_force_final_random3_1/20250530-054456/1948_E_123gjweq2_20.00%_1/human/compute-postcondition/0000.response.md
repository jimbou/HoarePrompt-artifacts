Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left <= right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of integers with length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2.**

The code block assigns values to four new variables: small_element, big_element, mid, and not_mid. The values of these variables are calculated based on the initial values of left and right. The first line assigns the value of left + 1 to small_element. The second line assigns the value of right + 1 to big_element. The third line calculates the value of mid as the integer division of (big_element - small_element) by 2, which is equivalent to (right - left + 1) // 2. The fourth line calculates the value of not_mid as right - left + 1 minus mid, which is equivalent to right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2. The values of left, right, clique, arr, and cliquess remain unchanged.
