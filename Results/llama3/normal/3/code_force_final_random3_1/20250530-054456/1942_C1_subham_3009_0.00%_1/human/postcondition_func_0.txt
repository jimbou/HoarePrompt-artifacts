The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) followed by x distinct integers. It then prints the value of x - 2 for each test case. The function does not modify the input values or perform any calculations beyond printing the result. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and the results (x - 2) have been printed to the console.
