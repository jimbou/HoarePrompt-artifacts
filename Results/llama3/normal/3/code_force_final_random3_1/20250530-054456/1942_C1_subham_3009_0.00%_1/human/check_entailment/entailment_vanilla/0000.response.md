Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained from a regular polygon with n sides, given that x vertices have already been chosen and y additional vertices can be chosen.

The provided program simply prints x - 2 for each test case, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained when y = 0. This is because when y = 0, no additional vertices can be chosen, and the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be obtained is x - 2.

Since the problem statement guarantees that y = 0, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
