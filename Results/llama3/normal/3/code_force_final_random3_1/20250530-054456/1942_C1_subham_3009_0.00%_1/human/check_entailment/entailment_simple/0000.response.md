Reasoning:

The problem statement requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices in a regular polygon with n sides. The given Python program reads the input, processes it, and prints the maximum number of triangular pieces.

The key insight here is that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2. This is because each triangle is formed by connecting three vertices, and each vertex can be part of multiple triangles. By subtracting 2 from the number of chosen vertices, we effectively remove the two vertices that are not part of any triangle.

The program correctly implements this insight by printing the value of x - 2, where x is the number of chosen vertices.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
