Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, y is an integer, arr is a list of x integers, stdin is empty, and the value of x - 2 which is an integer between -1 and 2 * 10^5 - 2 inclusive is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` will retain their last values from the input, and `arr` will be the last list of integers read from the input. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases have been consumed. Finally, the last value of `x - 2` will be printed, which can be any integer between -1 and 2 * 10^5 - 2 inclusive.
