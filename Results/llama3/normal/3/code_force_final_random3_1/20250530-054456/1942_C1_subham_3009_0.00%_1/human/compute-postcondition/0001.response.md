Output State: **The program is running as the main module, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The program is still running as the main module. The variable `t` has been assigned an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) from the input. The stdin still contains the same number of test cases as the value of `t`. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` within the specified ranges, and the second line containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
