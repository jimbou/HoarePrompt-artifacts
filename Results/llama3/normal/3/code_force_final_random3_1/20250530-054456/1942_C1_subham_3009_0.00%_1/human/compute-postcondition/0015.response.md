Postcondition: ***stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. After the program executes, if the program is run as the main module, the value of x - 2 which is an integer between -1 and 2 * 10^5 - 2 inclusive is being printed.***
