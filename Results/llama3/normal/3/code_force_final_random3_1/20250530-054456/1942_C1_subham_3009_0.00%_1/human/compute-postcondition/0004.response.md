Based on the precondition, we know that `x` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The `print` statement is simply printing the value of `x - 2`.

Since `x` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, subtracting 2 from it will result in an integer between -1 and 2 * 10^5 - 2 inclusive.

Therefore, the output will be an integer between -1 and 199998 inclusive.

Output: **an integer between -1 and 199998 inclusive (which is the value of x - 2)**
