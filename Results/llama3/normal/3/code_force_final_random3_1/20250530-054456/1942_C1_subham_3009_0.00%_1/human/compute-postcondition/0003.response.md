Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code first decrements the value of `t` by 1, making it an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive. Then, it reads the first line of the test case from stdin, which contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`. The value of `n` becomes an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` becomes an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and `y` becomes 0. The second line of the test case is read from stdin and split into a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, which is assigned to `arr`. After executing the code, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.
