Reasoning:

The problem statement asks to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing at most y additional vertices, given that Bessie has already chosen x vertices. However, in the easy version of the problem, y is always 0, which means no additional vertices can be chosen.

The given program simply prints the value of x - 2 for each test case. This is actually the correct solution for this specific problem. Since no additional vertices can be chosen (y = 0), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed is simply the number of vertices Bessie has already chosen (x) minus 2. This is because each triangle requires 3 vertices, and with x vertices, we can form at most (x - 2) triangles.

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
