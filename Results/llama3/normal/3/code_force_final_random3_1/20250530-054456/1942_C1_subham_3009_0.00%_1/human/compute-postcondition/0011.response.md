Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, y is an integer, arr is a list of x integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and the value of x - 2 is being printed, where x - 2 is an integer between -1 and 2 * 10^5 - 2 inclusive**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` have been updated to the integer values read from the input, so they are now integers between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and an integer, respectively. The list `arr` now contains `x` integers read from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been decremented by 1, so it now contains `t - 1` test cases. Finally, the value of `x - 2` is being printed, which is an integer between -1 and 2 * 10^5 - 2 inclusive.
