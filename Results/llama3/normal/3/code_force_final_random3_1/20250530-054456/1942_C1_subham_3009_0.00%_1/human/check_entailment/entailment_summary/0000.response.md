Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices of a regular polygon with n sides. The given program simply prints the value of x - 2 for each test case, where x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

The key insight to this problem is that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed is equal to the number of vertices Bessie has chosen minus 2. This is because each vertex can be connected to every other vertex to form a triangle, but two vertices are needed to form the base of the triangle, leaving x - 2 vertices to form the remaining triangles.

The program correctly implements this insight by printing the value of x - 2 for each test case. The execution summary confirms that the program reads the input correctly and prints the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
