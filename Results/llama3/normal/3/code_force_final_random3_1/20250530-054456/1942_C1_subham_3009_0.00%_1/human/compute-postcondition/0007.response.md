Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, y is an integer, arr is a list of x integers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and the value of x - 2 is being printed**

Here's a description of the final state:

The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 10^4 inclusive. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` have been updated to the values read from the input, so they are now integers between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and any integer, respectively. The list `arr` now contains `x` integers read from the input. The number of test cases in stdin has been decremented by 1, so it now contains `t - 1` test cases. The value of `x - 2` is being printed.
