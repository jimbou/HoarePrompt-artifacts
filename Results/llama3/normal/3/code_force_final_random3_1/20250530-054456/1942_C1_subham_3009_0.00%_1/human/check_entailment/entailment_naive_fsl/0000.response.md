Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The key insight is that the maximum number of triangular pieces is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2. This is because each pair of chosen vertices can form a diagonal, and each diagonal can be used to create a triangle with a third vertex. Since y is 0, no additional vertices can be chosen, so the maximum number of triangular pieces is simply x - 2.

The program correctly reads the input, parses the chosen vertices, and prints the maximum number of triangular pieces. The logic is simple and straightforward, and it correctly handles all possible cases.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
