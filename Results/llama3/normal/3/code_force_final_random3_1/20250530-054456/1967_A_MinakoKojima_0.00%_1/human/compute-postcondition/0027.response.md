Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus `n * m`, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `n - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be `k` minus `n * m`, where `n` and `m` are integers. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the value of `i` is still `n - 1`.
