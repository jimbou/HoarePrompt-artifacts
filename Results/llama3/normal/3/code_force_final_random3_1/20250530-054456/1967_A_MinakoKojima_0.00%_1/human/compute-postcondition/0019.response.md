Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is (m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])) * (a[i] - (m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i-1])))*(a[i] - a[i - 1])*(a[i] - a[i - 1]), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 3, `a[i-1]` is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i-1]), `k` is k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i-1])**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` now includes an additional factor of `(a[i] - a[i - 1])`.
