Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) — the number of cards of type i you have at the beginning.**
