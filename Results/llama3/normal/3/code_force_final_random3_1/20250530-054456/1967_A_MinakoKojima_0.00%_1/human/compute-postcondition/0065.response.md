Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer minus the product of `n` and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` updated to `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `n`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` remains an integer minus the product of `n` and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` remains a list of integers with `a[i]` updated to `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` remains the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` becomes the product of the differences between consecutive elements of list `a`, `_` remains 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `i` becomes equal to `n`.
