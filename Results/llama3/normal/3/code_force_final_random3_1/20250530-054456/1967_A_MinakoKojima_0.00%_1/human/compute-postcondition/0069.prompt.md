Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) — the number of cards of type i you have at the beginning.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is a negative integer, a is a list of integers where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), ans is (m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])) * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]), _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n - 1, a[i] is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), k is k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is the result of the program, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n - 1, and the result of the program is printed, which is either the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to n times m, or the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the updated list a otherwise

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is the minimum value in list a, ans is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is not defined. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer minus the product of n and the minimum value in list a minus the sum of the minimum values between k and m + k // n - a[i] for all i in range(n), a is a list of integers with a[i] updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the minimum value in list a, ans is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of list a, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and i is n, and ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
