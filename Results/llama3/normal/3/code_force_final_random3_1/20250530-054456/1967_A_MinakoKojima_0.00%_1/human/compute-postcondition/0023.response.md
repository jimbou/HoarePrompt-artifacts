Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is a negative integer, a is a list of integers where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), ans is (m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])) * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]), _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n - 1, a[i] is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), k is k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), and ans is printed**
