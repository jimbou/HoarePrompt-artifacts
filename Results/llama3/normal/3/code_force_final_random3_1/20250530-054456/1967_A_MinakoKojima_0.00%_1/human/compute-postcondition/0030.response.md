To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer minus n * m, `a` is a list of integers where a[0] is updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0]), `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1**
