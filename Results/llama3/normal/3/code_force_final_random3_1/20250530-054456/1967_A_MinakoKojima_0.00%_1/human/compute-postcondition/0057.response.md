Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer minus the product of `n` and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` updated to `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the first element of list `a`, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to the first element of list `a`. The values of other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
