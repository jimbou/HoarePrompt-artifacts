Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer minus the product of `n` and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` updated to `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the product of the first element of list `a`, the difference between the second element and the first element of list `a`, the difference between the third element and the second element of list `a`, and the difference between the fourth element and the third element of list `a`, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 3**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the fourth element and the third element of list `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
