Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum score that can be obtained by rearranging the cards. The program first calculates the minimum number of cards of any type, and then checks if the number of coins is greater than or equal to the product of the number of distinct types of cards and the minimum number of cards. If it is, the program sets the result to the factorial of the number of distinct types of cards. Otherwise, the program updates the number of cards of each type based on the available coins and calculates the result as the product of the differences between consecutive updated card counts. The program then prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
