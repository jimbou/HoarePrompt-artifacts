The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is (m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])) * (a[i] - (m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i-1]))), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `a[i-1]` is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i-1]), `k` is k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i-1])**
