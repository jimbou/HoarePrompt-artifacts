Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is the minimum value in list a, ans is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is not defined. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer minus the product of n and the minimum value in list a minus the sum of the minimum values between k and m + k // n - a[i] for all i in range(n), a is a list of integers with a[i] updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the minimum value in list a, ans is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of list a, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and i is n, and ans is printed**
