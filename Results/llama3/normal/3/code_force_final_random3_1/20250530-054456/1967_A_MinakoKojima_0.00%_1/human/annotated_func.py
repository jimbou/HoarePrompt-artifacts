#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) — the number of cards of type i you have at the beginning.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        m = min(a)
        
        ans = 0
        
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is the minimum value in list a, ans is the result of the program, _ is the number of test cases, stdin contains no input, i is not defined. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer minus the product of n and the minimum value in list a minus the sum of the minimum values between k and m + k // n - a[i] for all i in range(n), a is a list of integers with a[i] updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the minimum value in list a, ans is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of list a, and ans is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. The second line contains n integers representing the initial number of cards of each type. The function calculates the result based on the number of coins and the minimum number of cards of any type. If the number of coins is greater than or equal to the product of n and the minimum number of cards, the result is the factorial of n. Otherwise, the function updates the number of cards of each type based on the available coins and calculates the result as the product of the differences between consecutive updated card counts. The function prints the result for each test case.
