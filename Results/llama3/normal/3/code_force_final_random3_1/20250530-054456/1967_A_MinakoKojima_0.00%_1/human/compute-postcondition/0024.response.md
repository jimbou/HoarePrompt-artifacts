The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. For the loop to execute again _ is 1 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input, i is n - 1**
