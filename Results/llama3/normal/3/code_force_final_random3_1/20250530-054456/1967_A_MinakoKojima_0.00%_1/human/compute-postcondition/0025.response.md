Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n - 1**

The code block consists of four lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `k`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. The third line assigns the minimum value of the list `a` to `m`. The fourth line assigns 0 to `ans`. 

The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m` are updated based on the input values. The value of `ans` is reset to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at `n - 1`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
