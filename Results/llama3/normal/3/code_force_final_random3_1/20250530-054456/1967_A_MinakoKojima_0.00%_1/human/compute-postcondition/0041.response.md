Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `k` is an integer minus n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), `ans` is a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * (a[3] - a[2]), `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the fourth and third elements of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
