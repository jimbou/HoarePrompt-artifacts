Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is a negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0]), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is n - 1, `a[i]` is updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `k` is updated to k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to the first element of the list `a`, which is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`. The values of other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
