Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is the result of the program, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n - 1. If k is greater than or equal to n times m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, k is updated to k minus n times the minimum of k and m plus k divided by n minus a[i], a is updated to a list of integers where each element a[i] is updated to m plus the minimum of k and m plus k divided by n minus a[i] for all i in range n, and ans is the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the updated list a.**
