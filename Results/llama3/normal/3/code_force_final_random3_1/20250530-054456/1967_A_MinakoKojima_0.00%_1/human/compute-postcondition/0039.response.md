Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer minus n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), `ans` is a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]), `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the value of `i` is still 2.
