Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer minus the product of n and the minimum value in list a minus the sum of the minimum values between k and m + k // n - a[i] for all i in range(n), a is a list of integers with a[i] updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the minimum value in list a, ans is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, the value of `k` is reduced by the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`, the list `a` is updated with each element `a[i]` set to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, the minimum value `m` in list `a` remains unchanged, the value of `ans` remains 0, the value of `_` remains 2, the stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`.
