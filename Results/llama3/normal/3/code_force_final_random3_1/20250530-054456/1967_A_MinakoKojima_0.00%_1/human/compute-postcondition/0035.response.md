Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer minus n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), `ans` is a[i] where i is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is n - 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to the first element of the list `a`, which is `a[0]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `i` is still `n - 1`.
