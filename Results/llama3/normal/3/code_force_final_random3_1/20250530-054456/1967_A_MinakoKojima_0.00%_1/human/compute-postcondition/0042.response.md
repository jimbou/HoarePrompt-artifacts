Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `k` is an integer minus n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), `ans` is a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]), `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is n - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`, and the value of `i` is `n-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
