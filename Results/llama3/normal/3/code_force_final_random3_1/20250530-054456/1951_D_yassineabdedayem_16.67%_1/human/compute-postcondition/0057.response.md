Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, number is the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, k remains unchanged, otherwise k is decreased by Min.***
