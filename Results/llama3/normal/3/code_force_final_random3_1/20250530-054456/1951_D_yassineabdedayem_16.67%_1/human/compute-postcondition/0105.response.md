Postcondition: ***_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is less than 60, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is Min and tab is a list containing two string representations of Min. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, tab is a list containing two string representations of the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and Min is less than Max.***
