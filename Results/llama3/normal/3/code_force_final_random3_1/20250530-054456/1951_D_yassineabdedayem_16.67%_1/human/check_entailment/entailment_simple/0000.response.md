Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the greedy strategy to determine if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program iterates through the possible number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall, starting from the maximum possible number (Max) and then the minimum possible number (Min). It updates the number of coins Alice has left (n) and the number of jewels she has bought (k) accordingly.

The program also checks if the number of stalls (rep) exceeds 60 or if Alice has no more coins left (n == 0). If either condition is met, the program stops and prints "NO".

If the program successfully sets up the stalls and Alice buys exactly k jewels, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices for each stall.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
