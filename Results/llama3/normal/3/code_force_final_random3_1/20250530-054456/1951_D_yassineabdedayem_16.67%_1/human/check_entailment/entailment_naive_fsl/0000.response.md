Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is less than `k` and `n` is not a multiple of `k`. In this case, the program will print "NO" even though it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the program will print "NO" because `n` is not a multiple of `k`. However, it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible solution is to set up 3 stalls with prices 2, 2, and 3, respectively. In this case, Alice will buy 3 jewels at the first stall, 0 jewels at the second stall, and 0 jewels at the third stall, for a total of 3 jewels.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all possible cases, and the correctness is **False**.
