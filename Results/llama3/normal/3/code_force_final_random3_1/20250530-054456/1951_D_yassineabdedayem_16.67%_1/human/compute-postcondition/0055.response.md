Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its original value, number is the minimum of n // k and k, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of the minimum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to be the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, which is the same as the original value of `Min`. The value of `k` has been updated to be `k - Max`, which means it is less than or equal to its original value. The value of `tab` has also been updated to contain the string representation of the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, which is the same as the original value of `number`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `rep`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by four.
