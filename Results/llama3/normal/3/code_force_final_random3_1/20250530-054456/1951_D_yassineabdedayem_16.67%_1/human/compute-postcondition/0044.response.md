The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, after this line, stdin will contain multiple test cases minus three. The second line assigns 0 to `rep`, overwriting its previous value. The third line assigns 0 to `number`, overwriting its previous value. The fourth line assigns an empty list to `tab`, overwriting its previous value.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**
