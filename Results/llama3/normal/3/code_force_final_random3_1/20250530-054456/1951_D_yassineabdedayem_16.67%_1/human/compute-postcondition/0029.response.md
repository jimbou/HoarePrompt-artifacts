According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tab`. If the list `tab` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the length of the list `tab` is 1, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `tab` to have at least 1 element and `i` is now the first element in the list `tab`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string representation of a number, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `k` is 0, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is equal to 1 is being printed, `i` is the first element in the list `tab`**
