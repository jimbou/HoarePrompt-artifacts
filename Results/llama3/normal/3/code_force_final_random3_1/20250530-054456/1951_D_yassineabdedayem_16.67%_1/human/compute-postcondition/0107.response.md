Output State: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, k is greater than 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing string representations of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of n becomes 0, the value of k remains greater than 0, the value of number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, the value of rep is less than 61, and the list tab contains string representations of number. The values of _t, _, Min, Max, and stdin remain unchanged.
