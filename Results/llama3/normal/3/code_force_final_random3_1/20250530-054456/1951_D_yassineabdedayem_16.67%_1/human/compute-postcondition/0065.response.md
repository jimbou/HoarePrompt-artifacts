Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, k is greater than or equal to 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of Min and the string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of n is 0, the value of k is greater than or equal to 0, the value of number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, the value of rep is less than or equal to 60, and the value of tab is a list containing the string representation of Min and the string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k. The values of t, _, and stdin remain unchanged.
