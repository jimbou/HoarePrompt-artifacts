Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, number is the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, number is the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, k remains unchanged, otherwise k is decreased by Min.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, tab is a list containing the string representation of Min and the string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 3, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus five.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
