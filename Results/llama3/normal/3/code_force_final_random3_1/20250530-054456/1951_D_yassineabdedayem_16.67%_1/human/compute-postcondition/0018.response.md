Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and less than its original value by `Min * Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `k` is the difference between its original value and the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is `k - Min`.**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated according to the given code. `Min` is now the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
