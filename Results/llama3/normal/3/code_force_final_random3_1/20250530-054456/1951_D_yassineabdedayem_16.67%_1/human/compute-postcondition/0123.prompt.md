Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, k is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing string representations of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is 0 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, k is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing at least 1 string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is greater than 0 is being printed, and the first element in the tab list is being printed, and the first element in the tab list is printed, i, where i is the first element in the tab list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, k is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing at least 2 string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is greater than 0 is being printed, and the first element in the tab list is being printed, and the first element in the tab list is printed, i, where i is the second element in the tab list, and the second element in the tab list which is i is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, k is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing at least 3 string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is greater than 0 is being printed, and the first element in the tab list is being printed, and the first element in the tab list is printed, i, where i is the third element in the tab list, and the third element in the tab list which is i is being printed, and the third element in the tab list which is i is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
