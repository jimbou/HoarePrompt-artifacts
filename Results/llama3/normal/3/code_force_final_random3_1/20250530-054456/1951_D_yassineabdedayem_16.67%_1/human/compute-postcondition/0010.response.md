Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, and Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k. If Max is equal to k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is 0, number is Min, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. Otherwise, k is k - Min, number is Max, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The value of `n` is updated by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. The value of `k` is updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The value of `rep` is incremented by 1. The list `tab` now contains the string representation of `number`. The values of `Min` and `Max` remain the same as they are not modified by the code.
