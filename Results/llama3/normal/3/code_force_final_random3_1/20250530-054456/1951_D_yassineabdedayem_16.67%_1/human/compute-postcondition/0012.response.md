Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

The code does not change the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, or `tab`. It only reassigns the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the given expressions. The values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated, but their relationship with `n` and `k` remains the same. The condition that either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` is still valid.
