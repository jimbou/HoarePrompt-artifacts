Output State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and k is set to its original value minus the minimum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of _t, _, n, k, number, rep, and tab remain the same as in the initial state. The values of Min and Max are updated to be the minimum of n // k and k, and the maximum of int(n / k) and k, respectively. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four, and k is still set to its original value minus the minimum of n // k and k.
