Output State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to be the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, which is the value of `Max`. The value of `k` has been updated to be its original value minus the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, which is the value of `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged.
