Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, and Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k. If Max is equal to k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k, and k is the difference between its original value and the maximum of int(n / k) and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is k - Min.***
