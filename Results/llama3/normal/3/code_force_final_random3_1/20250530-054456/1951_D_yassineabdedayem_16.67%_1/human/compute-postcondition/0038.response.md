Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, printing each element in the list `tab` followed by a space, and the length of `tab` is being printed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and each element in the list `tab` has been printed followed by a space. The length of the list `tab` is also being printed. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
