To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `tab`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since the length of the `tab` list is 0, we need to adjust its state to have at least 1 element.

Additionally, the variable `i` will take on the value of the first element in the `tab` list during the first iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, k is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing at least 1 string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is greater than 0 is being printed, i is the first element in the tab list**
