The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of Min and the string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If k is 0, 'YES' is printed, the length of tab which is 0 is printed, and a newline character is printed. If k is greater than 0, 'NO' is printed.**
