Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is k - Min.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as 0. The value of `n` remains greater than 0. The value of `rep` remains 1. The value of `tab` remains a list containing the string representation of number. The value of `Min` remains the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. The value of `Max` remains the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The value of `number` is now the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The value of `k` is now `k - Min`.
