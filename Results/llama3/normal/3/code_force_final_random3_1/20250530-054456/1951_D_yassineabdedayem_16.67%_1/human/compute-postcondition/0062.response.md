Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and decreased by Min, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to be the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, which is the new value of `Max`. The value of `k` has been decreased by `Min`, which is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
