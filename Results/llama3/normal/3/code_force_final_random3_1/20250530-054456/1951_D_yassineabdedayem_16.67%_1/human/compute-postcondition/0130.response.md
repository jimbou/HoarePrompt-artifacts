Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and k. It then attempts to find a sequence of numbers that can be used to make k jewels using n coins, with the goal of making k jewels. If successful, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. If it fails to find a sequence, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.**
