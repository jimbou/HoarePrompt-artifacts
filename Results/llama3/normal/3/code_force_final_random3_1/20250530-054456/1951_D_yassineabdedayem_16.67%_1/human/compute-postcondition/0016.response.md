Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than 0 and less than its original value by Min * Max, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, and Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k. If Max is equal to k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k, and k is the difference between its original value and the maximum of int(n / k) and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is k - Min.**

The code first appends the string representation of `number` to the `tab` list. Then, it subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`, reducing its value. Finally, it increments `rep` by 1. The values of `t`, `_`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged, while `number` and `k` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
