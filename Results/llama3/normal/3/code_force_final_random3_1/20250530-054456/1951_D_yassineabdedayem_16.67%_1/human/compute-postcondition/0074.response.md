The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list tab, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list tab.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, tab has at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list tab. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element in the list.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, k is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list tab, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of tab which is at least 2 is being printed, and the second element of the list tab which is i is being printed**
