Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, number is the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, k remains unchanged, otherwise k is decreased by Min.**

The code block has the following effects on the program:

1. The first line appends the string representation of `number` to the `tab` list. This adds a new element to the list, which now contains two elements: the original string representation of `number` and the new string representation of `number`.

2. The second line subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. This reduces the value of `n` by the product of `Min` and `Max`.

3. The third line increments `rep` by 1. This increases the value of `rep` from 1 to 2.

The final state of the program includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, along with the updated values of the variables that are modified by the code. The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged, while the values of `n`, `rep`, and `tab` are updated as described above.
