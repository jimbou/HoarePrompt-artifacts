Output State: **`_t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is not equal to 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `number` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the values of `_t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `number`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged. The new variables `Min` and `Max` are introduced, which are calculated based on the values of `n` and `k`. `Min` is the minimum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k`, while `Max` is the maximum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four.
