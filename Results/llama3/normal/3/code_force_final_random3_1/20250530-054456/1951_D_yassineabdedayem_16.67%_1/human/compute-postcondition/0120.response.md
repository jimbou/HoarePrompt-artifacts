The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  tab, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tab list.  If the list has at least 3 string representation of number the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, tab list has at least 2 string representation of number, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 string representation of number and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, k is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing at least 3 string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is greater than 0 is being printed, and the first element in the tab list is being printed, and the first element in the tab list is printed, i, where i is the third element in the tab list, and the third element in the tab list which is i is being printed**
