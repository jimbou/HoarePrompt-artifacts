Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is 0, k is 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of k is 0, and 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is equal to 1 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string representation of a number, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `k` is 0, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is equal to 1 is being printed, `i` is the first element in the list `tab`, and the first element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of numbers, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `k` is 0, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is equal to 2 is being printed, `i` is the second element in the list `tab`, and the second element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space, and the second element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 3 string representations of numbers, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `k` is 0, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is equal to 3 is being printed, `i` is the third element in the list `tab`, and the third element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space, and the third element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space, and the third element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
