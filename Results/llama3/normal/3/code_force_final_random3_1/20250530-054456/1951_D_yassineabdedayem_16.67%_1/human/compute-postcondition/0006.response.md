Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and is equal to 0, rep is 0, number is equal to Min, tab is an empty list, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 0, and the value of `number` has been set to `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `Min` is still the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and the value of `Max` is still the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The product of `n` and `Min` is still less than or equal to `k`.
