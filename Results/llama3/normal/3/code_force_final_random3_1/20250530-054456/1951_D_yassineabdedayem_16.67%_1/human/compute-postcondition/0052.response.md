Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, number is the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains the same. The value of `n` is decreased by the product of `Min` and `Max`, but it is still greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `k` remains unchanged. The value of `number` is set based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The value of `rep` is incremented by 1. The list `tab` now contains the string representation of `number`. The values of `Min` and `Max` remain the same. The number of test cases in stdin is decreased by 1.
