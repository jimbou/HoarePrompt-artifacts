Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, k is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of Min and the string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of tab which is 2 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, k is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list tab, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of tab which is at least 1 is being printed, and the first element of the list tab which is i is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, k is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list tab, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of tab which is at least 2 is being printed, and the second element of the list tab which is i is being printed, and the second element of the list tab which is i is being printed again

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, k is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list tab, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of tab which is at least 3 is being printed, and the third element of the list tab which is i is being printed, and the third element of the list tab which is i is being printed again, and the third element of the list tab which is i is being printed again




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
