Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is 0, k is 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains a positive integer greater than 0, _ remains 0, n becomes 0, k becomes 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
