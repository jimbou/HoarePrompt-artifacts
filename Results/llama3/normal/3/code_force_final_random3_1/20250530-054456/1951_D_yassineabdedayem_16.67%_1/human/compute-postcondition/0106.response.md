Output State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is less than 61, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and tab is a list containing three string representations of the maximum of int(n / k) and k.**

In this output state, the values of `_t`, `_`, `k` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `Min * Max` from it, and `rep` is incremented by 1. The values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `n`. The value of `number` is updated to be the maximum of `int((n - Min * Max) / k)` and `k`. The list `tab` now contains three string representations of the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
