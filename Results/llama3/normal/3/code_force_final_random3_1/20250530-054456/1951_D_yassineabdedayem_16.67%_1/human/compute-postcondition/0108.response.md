Output State: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, k is greater than 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing string representations of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of n becomes 0, and the value of k remains greater than 0. The value of number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k. The value of rep is less than 61, indicating that the loop executed less than 61 times. The list tab contains string representations of the value of number. The values of Min and Max are the minimum and maximum of n // k and k, respectively. The values of _t, _, and stdin remain unchanged.
