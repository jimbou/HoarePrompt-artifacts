The code prints the length of the list `tab`, which contains the string representation of the number.
Since `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and the current value of `k` is 0, `number` will be 0.
The string representation of 0 is '0', so the list `tab` contains only one element, which is '0'.
Therefore, the length of `tab` is 1.
Output: **1**
