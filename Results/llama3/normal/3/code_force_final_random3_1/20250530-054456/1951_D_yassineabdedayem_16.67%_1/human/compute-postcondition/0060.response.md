Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` remains unchanged, otherwise `k` is decreased by `Min`.**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the current values of `n` and `k`. The value of `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and the value of `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `k` may change depending on the values of `Max` and `Min`.
