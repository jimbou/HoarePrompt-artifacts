Output State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, number is Min, rep is less than 60, tab is a list containing two string representations of Min, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, Min equals number and Max equals number, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to `Min`, which is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. The value of `k` has been updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
