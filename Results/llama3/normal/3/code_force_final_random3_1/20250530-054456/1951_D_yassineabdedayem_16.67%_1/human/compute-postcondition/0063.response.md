Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then k remains unchanged, number is Min, and tab is a list containing the string representation of Min. Otherwise, k is decreased by Min, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and tab is a list containing the string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k. In both cases, rep is 2, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.***
