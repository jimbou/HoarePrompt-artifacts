Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If k is 0, the loop has executed all iterations, printing each element in the list `tab` followed by a space, and the length of `tab` is being printed. If k is not equal to 0, 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of Min and the string representation of the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If k is 0, 'YES' is printed, the length of tab which is 0 is printed, and a newline character is printed. If k is greater than 0, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing string representations of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If k is 0, 'YES' is printed, the length of the tab list which is greater than 0 is being printed, and all elements in the tab list are being printed, and all elements in the tab list which are i are being printed. If k is not equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
