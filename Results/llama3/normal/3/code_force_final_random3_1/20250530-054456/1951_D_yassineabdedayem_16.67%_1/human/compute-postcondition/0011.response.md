According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `k`, `rep`, and the condition `n >= k`. For the loop to execute again, all these conditions must be true.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:

* `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
* `k` is greater than 0
* `rep` is 1
* `n >= k` is true

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states as follows:

* `n` must be greater than 0 (since `n != 0` is a condition)
* `k` must be greater than 0 (no change needed)
* `rep` must be less than 60 (no change needed, since `rep` is already 1)
* `n >= k` must be true (no change needed, since it's already true)

Additionally, we need to consider the conditional statements inside the loop body. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` becomes 0, which would make the loop condition false. Therefore, we need to ensure that this condition is not met. We can do this by making sure that `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**
