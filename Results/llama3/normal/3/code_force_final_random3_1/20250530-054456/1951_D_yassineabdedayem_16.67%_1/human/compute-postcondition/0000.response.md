The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer in the input is read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
