Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than or equal to k and less than its original value by Min * Max, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is k - Min.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to `k` and less than its original value by `Min * Max`. The value of `number` is now the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and the value of `k` is now `k - Min`.
