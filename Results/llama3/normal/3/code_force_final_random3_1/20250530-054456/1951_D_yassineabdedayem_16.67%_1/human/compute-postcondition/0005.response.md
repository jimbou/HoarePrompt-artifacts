Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of `Max` is equal to `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`.***
