Output State: **`_t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `rep` is less than 60, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `Min` equals `number` and `Max` equals `number`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated to be equal to `number`, which is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
