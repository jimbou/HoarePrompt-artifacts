To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its state is still relevant for the loop to execute).

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, but its state is still relevant for the loop to execute. Since the loop will iterate `t` times, the initial value of `_` should be 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `_` is 0**
