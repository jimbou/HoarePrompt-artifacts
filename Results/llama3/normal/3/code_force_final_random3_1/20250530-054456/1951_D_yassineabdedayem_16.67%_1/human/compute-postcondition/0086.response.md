Output State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, number is 0, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the values of `_t` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the first integer from the input, and the value of `k` is updated to the second integer from the input. The value of `number` is reset to 0, and the value of `rep` is also reset to 0. The list `tab` is emptied. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one due to the `readline()` function consuming one line of input.
