Postcondition: **`_t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is not equal to 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `number` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four. Additionally, the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` equals `k`, and the product of `n` and the minimum of `n // k` and `k` is less than or equal to `k`.**
