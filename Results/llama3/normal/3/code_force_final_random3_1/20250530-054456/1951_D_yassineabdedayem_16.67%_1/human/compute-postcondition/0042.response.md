Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If k is 0, the loop has executed all iterations, printing each element in the list `tab` followed by a space, and the length of `tab` is being printed. If k is not equal to 0, 'NO' is being printed.**
