The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list tab, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list tab.  If the list has at least 3 string representations of numbers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, tab has at least 2 string representations of numbers, i is the second element in the list tab. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 string representations of numbers and the i is the third element in the list tab.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 3 string representations of numbers, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `k` is 0, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is equal to 3 is being printed, `i` is the third element in the list `tab`, and the third element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space, and the third element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space**
