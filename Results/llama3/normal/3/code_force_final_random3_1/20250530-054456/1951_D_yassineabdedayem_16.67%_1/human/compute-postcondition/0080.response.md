Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, k is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is an empty list, i is not defined, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of tab which is 0 is being printed, and a newline character is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and has printed all the elements in the list `tab`. The list `tab` is now empty, and the variable `i` is no longer defined. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged. The loop has also printed a newline character at the end.
