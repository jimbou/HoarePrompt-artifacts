Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is equal to 0, `number` is equal to `Min`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. Otherwise, `k` is equal to `k - Min`, `number` is equal to `Max`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. In both cases, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.***
