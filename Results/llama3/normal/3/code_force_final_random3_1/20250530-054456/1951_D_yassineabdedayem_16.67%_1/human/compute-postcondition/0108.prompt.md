Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, number is 0, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. Additionally, if the maximum of int(n / k) and k equals k and the product of n and the minimum of n // k and k is less than or equal to k, then k is set to its original value minus 1. Otherwise, k is set to its original value minus the minimum of n // k and k.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than or equal to k and is decreased by the product of Min and Max, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 2, tab is a list containing two string representations of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is set to its original value minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k. Otherwise, k remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: _t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is less than 61, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and tab is a list containing three string representations of the maximum of int(n / k) and k.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
