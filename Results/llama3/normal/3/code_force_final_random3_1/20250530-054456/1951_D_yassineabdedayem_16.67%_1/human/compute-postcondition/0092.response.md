Output State: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is not equal to 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value by Min, number is equal to the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. Additionally, either Max is not equal to k or n * Min is greater than k.**

In this output state, the values of `_t`, `_`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `k` is decreased by `Min`, and the value of `number` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, which is the original value of `Max`. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus four. The additional conditions regarding `Max`, `k`, and `n * Min` also remain valid.
