Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as 0. The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The values of `n` and `k` are now integers. The variable `rep` is initialized to 0, and the variable `number` is also initialized to 0. An empty list `tab` is created. Since two integers were read from stdin, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by two.
