Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than or equal to k and less than its original value by Min * Max, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is Min, and k is k - Max.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to `k` and less than its original value by `Min * Max`, as this condition is not affected by the code. The values of `Min` and `Max` also remain the same, as they are calculated based on the original values of `n` and `k`. The value of `number` is now set to `Min`, and the value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
