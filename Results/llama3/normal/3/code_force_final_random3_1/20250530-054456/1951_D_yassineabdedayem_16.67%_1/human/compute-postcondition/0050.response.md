Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is not equal to 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value by Min, rep is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, tab is an empty list, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. Either Max is not equal to k or n * Min is larger than k**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, which is the value of `Max`. The value of `k` has been updated to be less than its original value by `Min`, which is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
