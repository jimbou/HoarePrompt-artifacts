Postcondition: ***_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is not equal to 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. Additionally, if the maximum of int(n / k) and k equals k and the product of n and the minimum of n // k and k is less than or equal to k, then k is set to its original value minus 1. Otherwise, k is set to its original value minus the minimum of n // k and k.***
