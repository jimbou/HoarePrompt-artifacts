Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is greater than or equal to k and less than its original value by Min * Max, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k. If Max is equal to k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is Min and k is k - Max. Otherwise, number is Max and k is k - Min.***
