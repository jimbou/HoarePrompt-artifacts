Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is not equal to 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three. The current value of `Max` equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`***
