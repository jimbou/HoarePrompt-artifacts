Postcondition: **_t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is set to its original value minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k. Otherwise, k remains unchanged.**
