The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number, `number` is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
