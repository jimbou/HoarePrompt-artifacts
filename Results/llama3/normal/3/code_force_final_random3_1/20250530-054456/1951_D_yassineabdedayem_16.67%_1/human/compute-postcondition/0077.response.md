To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `tab`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `tab`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `tab` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list `tab`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is 0, k is 0, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list tab, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of tab which is at least 3 is being printed, and the third element of the list tab which is i is being printed, and the third element of the list tab which is i is being printed again**
