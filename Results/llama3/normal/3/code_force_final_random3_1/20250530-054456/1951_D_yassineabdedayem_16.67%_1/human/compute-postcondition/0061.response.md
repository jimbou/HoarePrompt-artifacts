Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and decreased by Max, number is Min, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of Min, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the value of `number` is updated to be equal to `Min`, which is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. The value of `k` is decreased by `Max`, which is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus four.
