Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is not equal to 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 1, number is set to the minimum of n // k and k. Otherwise, k is decreased by Min, number is set to the maximum of int(n / k) and k. In both cases, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.***
