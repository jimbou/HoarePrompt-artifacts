To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in tab:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `tab`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string representation of a number, and `i` is the first element in the list `tab`.

For the loop to execute again, `tab` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be the second element in the list `tab`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of numbers.
* `i` is the second element in the list `tab`.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of numbers, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `k` is 0, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is equal to 2 is being printed, `i` is the second element in the list `tab`, and the second element in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space**
