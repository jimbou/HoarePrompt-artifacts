The code prints the value of `shapes`, which is the total number of shapes that can be formed using the integers in the original list `palka`. Each shape is formed by a group of three or more identical integers, and the number of shapes is calculated by dividing the frequency of each integer by 3 and summing up the results.

Since `palka` is an empty list, the frequency of each integer is 0, and therefore the number of shapes is 0.

Output: **0**
