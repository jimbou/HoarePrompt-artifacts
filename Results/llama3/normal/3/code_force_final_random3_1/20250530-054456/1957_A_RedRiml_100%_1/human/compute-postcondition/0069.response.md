Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 2 unique integers from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` by 3, where `j` is the second unique integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated by adding the integer division of the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` by 3. The frequency of `j` is obtained from the dictionary `d`, which contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `w` still being at least 2, `stdin` containing `t-3` test cases, `ln` being an integer, `palka` being an empty list, and `pl` containing at least 2 unique integers from the original list `palka`.
