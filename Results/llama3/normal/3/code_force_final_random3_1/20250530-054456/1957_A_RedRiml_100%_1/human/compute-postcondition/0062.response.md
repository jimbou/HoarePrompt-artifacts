Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `palka` is empty, the list `pl` contains all unique integers from the original list `palka`, the dictionary `d` contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`, and the value of `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
