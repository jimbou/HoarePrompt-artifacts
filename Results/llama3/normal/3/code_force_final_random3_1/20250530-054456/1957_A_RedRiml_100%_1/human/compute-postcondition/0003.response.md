The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary**
