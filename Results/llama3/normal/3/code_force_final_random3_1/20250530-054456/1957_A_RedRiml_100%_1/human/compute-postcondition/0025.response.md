Output State: **w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is an empty list, d is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list palka and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list palka, pl is a list of unique integers from the original list palka, and shapes is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable "shapes" which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
