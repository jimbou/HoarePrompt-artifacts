Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`, `pl` contains the first integer in the list `palka` and may also contain the second integer in the list `palka` if it was not already in `pl`, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3 if the frequency is 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, which is either 1 if `x` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `x` was already in `d`. If `i` was not previously in `d`, then `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 2. Otherwise, the frequency of `i` in `d` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still at least 3, and the number of test cases in `stdin` remains t-4. The value of `ln` is still an integer. The list `palka` still has at least 3 integers, and `i` is still the third integer in the list. The list `pl` still contains the first integer in `palka` and may also contain the second integer if it was not already in `pl`. The value of `shapes` is still being printed and is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3 if the frequency is 3 or more. The dictionary `d` still contains the frequency of each integer in `palka`, but the frequency of `i` has been increased by 1. If `i` was not previously in `d`, its frequency is now 2; otherwise, its frequency has been increased by 1.
