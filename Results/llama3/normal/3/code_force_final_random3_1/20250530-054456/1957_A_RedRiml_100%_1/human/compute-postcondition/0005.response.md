Output State: **w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, pl is an empty list, d is a dictionary that contains the key i with value 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of w remains at least 1, the number of test cases in stdin remains t-2, the values of ln, palka, i, and pl remain unchanged. The dictionary d now contains the key i with a value of 1.
