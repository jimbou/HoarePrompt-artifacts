Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with value 1, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains at least 2, the number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-3`, `ln` is still an integer, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least one integer, `i` is still the first integer in `palka`, `pl` is still an empty list, but now `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with value 1, and `shapes` is still increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed.
