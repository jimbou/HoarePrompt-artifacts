Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`. If `i` was not previously in dictionary `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. If `i` was already in `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is the previous value of `d[i]` increased by 1.***
