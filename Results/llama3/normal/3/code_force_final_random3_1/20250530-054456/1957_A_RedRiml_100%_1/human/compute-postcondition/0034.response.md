Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `palka` and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique integers from the original list `palka` that must have at least 3 integers, `j` is the third integer in the list `pl`, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated by adding the integer division of the frequency of `j` (which is the third integer in the list `pl`) by 3. The frequency of `j` is obtained from the dictionary `d`, which stores the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged.
