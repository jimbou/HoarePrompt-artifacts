Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value of 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each with two lines of input. The list `palka` and the integer `ln` retain their previous values.
