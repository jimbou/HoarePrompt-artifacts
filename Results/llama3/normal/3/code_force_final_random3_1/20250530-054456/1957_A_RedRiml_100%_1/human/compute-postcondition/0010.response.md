Output State: **w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, pl is a list containing the first integer of palka, and d is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is either 1 if i was not previously in d, or the previous value of d[i] increased by 1 if i was already in d.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of w remains the same, the number of test cases in stdin is still t-2, and the structure of each test case is unchanged. The list palka and the dictionary d remain the same. The list pl now contains the first integer of palka, which is i.
