Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 1 unique integer from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` by 3, and `j` is the first integer in `pl`, and the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` is 3 or more**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `shapes` has been increased by the number of times the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` can be divided by 3, where `j` is the first integer in `pl` and its frequency in the original list `palka` is 3 or more. The values of the other variables remain the same.
