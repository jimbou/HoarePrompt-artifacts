According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pl`. If `pl` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original list `palka`, so for the loop to be executed, `pl` must have at least 1 integer and `j` is the first integer in `pl`.

State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 1 unique integer from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`, `shapes` is 0, `j` is the first integer in `pl`**
