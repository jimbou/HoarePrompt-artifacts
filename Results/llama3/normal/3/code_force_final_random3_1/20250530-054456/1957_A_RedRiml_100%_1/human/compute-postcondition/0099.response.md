Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`, `pl` contains the first integer in the list `palka`, the second integer in the list `palka` if it was not already in `pl`, and either the third integer in the list `palka` if it was not in `pl` or not if it was in `pl`, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3 if the frequency is 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, which is either 1 if `x` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `x` was already in `d`. The frequency of `i` in `d` is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`***
