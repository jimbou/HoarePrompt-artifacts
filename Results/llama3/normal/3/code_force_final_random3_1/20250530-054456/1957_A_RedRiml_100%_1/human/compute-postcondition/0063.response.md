Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`, and `shapes` is 0.**

The code resets the value of `shapes` to 0, which was previously calculated based on the frequency of integers in the original list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `shapes` is now 0, and it is no longer related to the frequency of integers in the original list `palka`.
