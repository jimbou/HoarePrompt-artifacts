The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 3 unique integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, pl has at least 2 unique integers from the original list palka. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 unique integers and j is the third unique integer in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 3 unique integers from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`. If the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` by 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `j` is the third unique integer in the list**
