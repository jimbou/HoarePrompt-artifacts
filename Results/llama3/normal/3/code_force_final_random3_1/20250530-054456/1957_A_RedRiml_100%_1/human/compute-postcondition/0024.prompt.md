Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, if the first integer of palka is not in pl, then pl contains the first integer of palka, and d is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is either 1 if i was not previously in d, or the previous value of d[i] increased by 1 if i was already in d. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`. If `i` was not previously in dictionary `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. If `i` was already in `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is the previous value of `d[i]` increased by 1. If `i` is in `pl`, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `palka`. If `i` was not previously in dictionary `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. If `i` was already in `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is the previous value of `d[i]` increased by 1. If `i` is in `pl`, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers. If `d` contains `i` as a key, `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 2. If `i` was already in `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is the previous value of `d[i]` increased by 1. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` contains the third integer in `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
