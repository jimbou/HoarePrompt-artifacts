Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl contains all unique integers in the list palka, shapes is 0, d contains the key x with a value that is the frequency of x in the list palka.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least one element, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the first unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is at least 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least two elements, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is at least `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least three elements, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the third unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is at least `d[j] // 3` plus the previous value of `shapes`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains the same as its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
