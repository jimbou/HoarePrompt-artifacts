Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is at least 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, and shapes is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list palka by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of shapes is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the integer `i` twice. Otherwise, `pl` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the integer `i` twice. Otherwise, `pl` remains unchanged. If `i` was not previously in `d`, then `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. If `i` was already in `d`, then `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is either 2 if `i` was not previously in `pl`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
