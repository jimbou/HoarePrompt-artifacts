Output State: **w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is an empty list, d is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list palka and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list palka, and pl is a list of unique integers from the original list palka.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The list `palka` is empty, indicating that all its elements have been processed. The dictionary `d` contains the frequency of each integer from the original list `palka`, and the list `pl` contains unique integers from the original list `palka`.
