The only object in the loop head is variable  `i` and list `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `palka`.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `i` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `palka`. If `i` was not previously in dictionary `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. If `i` was already in `d`, `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is the previous value of `d[i]` increased by 1. If `i` is in `pl`, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers.**
