The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `_` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is at least 1, `w` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is at least 2 and for the loop to execute again w must be greater than 2.
State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3 if the frequency is 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed**
