Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list that contains the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed.**

In this output state, the list `pl` now contains the integer `i`, which is the first integer in the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `shapes` is still being printed, and the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` is still being divided by 3 and added to `shapes` for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more.
