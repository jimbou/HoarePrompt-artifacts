To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `w`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `w` is an integer between 1 and 100, we can adjust its state to be at least 1.

State: **`w` is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**
