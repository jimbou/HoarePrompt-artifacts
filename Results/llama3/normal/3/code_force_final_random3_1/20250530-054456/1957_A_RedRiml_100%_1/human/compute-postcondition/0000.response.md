Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, `w` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is an integer between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
