This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then counts the frequency of each unique integer in the list, calculates the sum of the integer divisions of these frequencies by 3, and prints this sum for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point the input is exhausted.
