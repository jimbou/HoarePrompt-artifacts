The code prints the value of `shapes`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, but only if the frequency is 3 or more.

Since `palka` is an empty list, it does not contain any integers. Therefore, the frequency of each integer in `palka` is 0, and the integer division of 0 by 3 is 0.

As a result, `shapes` is the sum of 0, which is 0.

Output: **0**
