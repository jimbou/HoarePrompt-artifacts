Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` contains at least 1 unique integer from the original list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka`. If the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` in the original list `palka` by 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
