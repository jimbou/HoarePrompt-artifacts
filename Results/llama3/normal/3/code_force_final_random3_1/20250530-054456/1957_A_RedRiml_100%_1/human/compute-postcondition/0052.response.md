Output State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`, `pl` contains the integer `i` if `i` is not in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is increased by 1, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with an updated value, which is the previous value of `d[i]` plus 1. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties.
