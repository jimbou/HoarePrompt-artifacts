Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`, `pl` contains the first integer in the list `palka` if it was not already in `pl`, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3 if the frequency is 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, which is either 1 if `x` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `x` was already in `d`. If `i` was not previously in `d`, then `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, the frequency of `i` in `d` is increased by 1.***
