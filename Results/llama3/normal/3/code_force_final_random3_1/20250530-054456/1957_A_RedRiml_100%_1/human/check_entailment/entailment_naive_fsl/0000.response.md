Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that it only checks for sticks that can form triangles (i.e., sticks that appear at least 3 times). However, it does not consider other regular polygons that can be formed with the given sticks.

For example, if the input is:

4
6
2 2 2 2 2 2

The program will output 0, but the correct answer is 2, because we can form two squares with the given sticks.

The program needs to be modified to consider all possible regular polygons that can be formed with the given sticks, not just triangles.
