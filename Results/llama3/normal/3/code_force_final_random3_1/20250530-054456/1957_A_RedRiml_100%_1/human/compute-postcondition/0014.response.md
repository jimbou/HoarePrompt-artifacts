Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is either 2 if i was not previously in d and was 1, or the previous value of d[i] increased by 1 if i was already in d and was not 1.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `d[i]` is now either 2 if `i` was not previously in `d` and was 1, or the previous value of `d[i]` increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d` and was not 1.
