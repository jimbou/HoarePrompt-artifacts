The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, pl has at least 2 integers, j is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the j is the third integer in the list.
State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `palka` and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique integers from the original list `palka` that must have at least 3 integers, `j` is the third integer in the list `pl`.**
