According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pl`. If `pl` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka`, we can adjust the state of `palka` to ensure that it has at least one unique integer.

State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least one element, `shapes` is 0, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the first unique integer in `pl`**
