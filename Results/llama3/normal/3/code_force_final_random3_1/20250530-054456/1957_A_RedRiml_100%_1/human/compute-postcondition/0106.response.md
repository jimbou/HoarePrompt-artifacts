To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in pl:`.

According to the code, `pl` is a list of unique integers in `palka`, and `j` is the first unique integer in `pl`. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next unique integer in `pl`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least two elements, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is at least 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
