The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `_` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is at least 1, `w` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `w` must be greater than 1.
State: **`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `palka` and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed**
