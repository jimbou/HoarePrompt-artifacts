Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least one element, `shapes` is at least 1, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the first unique integer in `pl`. The current value of `d[j]` is at least 3, indicating that the frequency of `j` in `palka` is at least 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still at least 3, the number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-4`, `ln` is still an integer, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least one unique integer, `pl` still contains all unique integers in `palka` and has at least one element, `shapes` has been incremented by at least 1 (specifically, by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3), `d` still contains the frequency of each integer in `palka`, and `j` is still the first unique integer in `pl` with a frequency of at least 3.
