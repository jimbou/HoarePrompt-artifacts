Output State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least two elements, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is at least `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated based on the frequency of the second unique integer `j` in the list `palka`. If the frequency of `j` is at least 3, then `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
