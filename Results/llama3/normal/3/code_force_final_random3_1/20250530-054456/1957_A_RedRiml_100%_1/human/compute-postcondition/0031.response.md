Output State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `palka` and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique integers from the original list `palka` that must have at least 2 integers, `j` is the second integer in the list `pl`, and `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3 if the frequency of `j` is 3 or more, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated based on the frequency of the second integer `j` in the list `pl`. If the frequency of `j` is 3 or more, `shapes` has been increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3. Otherwise, the value of `shapes` remains unchanged. The other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
