The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and list `pl`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If the list has at least 3 unique integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `pl` has at least two elements, `j` is the second unique integer in `pl`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 unique integers and the `j` is the third unique integer in `pl`.
State: **`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least three elements, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the third unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is at least `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
