To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in palka:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `palka`.

According to the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
* The first integer of `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the first integer of `palka`.

For the loop to execute again, `palka` must have at least one more integer. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `palka` to have at least one more integer.

The state of `i` is not explicitly mentioned, but since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the next integer in `palka`.

The other variables (`w`, `stdin`, `ln`, `d`) are not part of the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key i with a value that is either 1 if i was not previously in d, or the previous value of d[i] increased by 1 if i was already in d.**
