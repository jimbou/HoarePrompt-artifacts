Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is an empty list, d is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list palka and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list palka, pl is a list of unique integers from the original list palka, and shapes is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `palka` and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique integers from the original list `palka` that must have at least 1 integer, `j` is the first integer in the list `pl`, and if the frequency of `j` is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `palka` and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique integers from the original list `palka` that must have at least 2 integers, `j` is the second integer in the list `pl`. If the frequency of `j` is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `palka` and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique integers from the original list `palka` that must have at least 3 integers, `j` is the third integer in the list `pl`. If the frequency of `j` is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
