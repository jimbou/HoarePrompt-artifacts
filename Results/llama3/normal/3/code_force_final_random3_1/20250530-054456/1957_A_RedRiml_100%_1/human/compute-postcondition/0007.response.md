Output State: **`w` is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, pl is an empty list, d is a dictionary that contains the key i and the value of d[i] is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still at least 1, and the stdin still contains t-2 test cases. Each test case still contains two lines. The first line still contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line still contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). The value of `ln` is still an integer. The list `palka` still contains at least 1 integer. The list `pl` is still empty. The dictionary `d` still contains the key `i`, but the value of `d[i]` has been increased by 1.
