Postcondition: **`w` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `palka` and each value is the frequency of that integer in the original list `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique integers from the original list `palka` that must have at least 1 integer, `j` is the first integer in the list `pl`, and `shapes` is 0. The current value of `d[j]` is at least 3.**
