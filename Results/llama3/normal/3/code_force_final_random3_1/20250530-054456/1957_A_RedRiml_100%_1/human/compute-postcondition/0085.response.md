Postcondition: **w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list palka, pl is an empty list, and shapes is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list palka by 3 if the frequency is 3 or more, and the value of shapes is being printed. The dictionary d contains the key i with a value that is the frequency of i in the list palka, which is either 1 if i was not previously in d, or increased by 1 if i was already in d. The current value of i is not in pl.**
