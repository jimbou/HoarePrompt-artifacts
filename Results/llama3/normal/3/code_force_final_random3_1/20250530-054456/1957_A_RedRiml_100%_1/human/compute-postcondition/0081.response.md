Output State: **w is at least 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list palka, pl is an empty list, d is a dictionary that contains the key i with value 1, and shapes is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list palka by 3 if the frequency is 3 or more, and the value of shapes is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of dictionary d has been updated to include the key i with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with w still being at least 3, stdin containing t-4 test cases, ln being an integer, palka being a list of integers with at least 1 integer, i being the first integer in the list palka, pl being an empty list, and shapes being increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list palka by 3 if the frequency is 3 or more, and the value of shapes is being printed.
