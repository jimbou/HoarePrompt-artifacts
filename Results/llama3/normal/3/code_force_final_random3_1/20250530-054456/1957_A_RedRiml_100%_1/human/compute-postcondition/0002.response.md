Output State: **w is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `ln`. Since stdin contains t-1 test cases, and each test case contains two lines, after reading the first line, stdin contains t-2 test cases. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `palka`. The third line initializes an empty list `pl`. The fourth line initializes an empty dictionary `d`. The value of `w` remains unchanged.
