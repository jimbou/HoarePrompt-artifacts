Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one unique integer, `pl` contains all unique integers in the list `palka` and must have at least three elements, `d` contains the key `x` with a value that is the frequency of `x` in the list `palka`, `j` is the third unique integer in `pl`. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is at least 3, then `shapes` is at least `d[j] // 3` plus the previous value of `shapes`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains the same as its previous value.***
