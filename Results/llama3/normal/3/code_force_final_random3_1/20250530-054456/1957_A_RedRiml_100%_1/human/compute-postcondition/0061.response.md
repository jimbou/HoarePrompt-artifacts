Postcondition: ***`w` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the original list `palka` by 3, for all integers that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the value of `shapes` is being printed. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the integer `i` twice. Otherwise, `pl` remains unchanged. If `i` was not previously in `d`, then `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. If `i` was already in `d`, then `d` contains the key `i` with a value that is either 2 if `i` was not previously in `pl`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.***
