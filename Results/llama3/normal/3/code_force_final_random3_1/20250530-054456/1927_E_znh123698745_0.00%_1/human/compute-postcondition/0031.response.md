The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`. If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list containing 3 elements (the original 2 elements and either the second last or the last element of the `array` list), `a` is a list containing either 1 and -3 or 2 and -2, and `stdin` contains at least `t-n-2` lines of input. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list containing 3 elements, `a` is a list containing either 2 and -1 or 1 and -2, and `stdin` contains at least `t-n-3` lines of input, `i` is an integer greater than 1**
