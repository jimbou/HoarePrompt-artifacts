To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input from `stdin`, as `int(input())` reads a line from the standard input. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more line of input available.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing `n` elements, `a` is a list containing `n` and `-n+1`, `stdin` contains at least `t-n-1` lines of input, and the elements of the `answer` list are being printed**
