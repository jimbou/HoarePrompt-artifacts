Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to generate a k-level permutation of length n. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of n and k. It then generates a list of integers from 1 to n and constructs a new list by alternating between the first and last elements of the original list. This approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1, which is the condition for a permutation to be k-level.

The program also handles the case when k is even, as required by the problem statement. The use of the list comprehension and the * operator in the print statement makes the code concise and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
