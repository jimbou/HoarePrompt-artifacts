Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, i is 1, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array, a is a list containing 1 and -2, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the element of `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to `answer`. Since `a` is a list containing 1 and -1, the last element of `a` is -1, which refers to the last element of `array`. Therefore, the last element of `array` is appended to `answer`. The second line decrements the last element of `a` by 1, making it -2. The value of `i` is not affected by the code block, so it remains 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `stdin` are also not affected.
