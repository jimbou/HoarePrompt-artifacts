To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we know that `i` is an integer greater than 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

To make the loop execute again, we need to increment `i` by 1. So, `i` becomes `i+1`. Since `i` is an integer greater than 1, `i+1` is also an integer greater than 1.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `k`, `array`, `stdin`, `answer`, and `a`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `stdin` contains at least t-n-2 lines of input, `i` is an integer greater than 1, `answer` is a list containing 2 elements, `a` is a list containing either 1 and -2 or 2 and -1**
