This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. It then generates a list of integers from 1 to n, constructs a new list by alternating between the first and last elements of the original list, and prints this new list. The function repeats this process for each test case.
