To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but we don't know its value. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1.

The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head, so we can adjust its state to be 1.

The other variables `k`, `array`, `answer`, `a`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing a single element 1, `a` is a list containing 1 and -1, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of input**
