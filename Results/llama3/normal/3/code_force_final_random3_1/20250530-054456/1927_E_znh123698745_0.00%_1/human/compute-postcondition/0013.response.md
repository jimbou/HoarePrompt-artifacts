Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, i is 3, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing five elements 1, either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the third element of array (if i is even), and the element of array at index a[-1], a is a list containing either 1 and -2 (if i is odd) or 0 and -3 (if i is even) or 3 and -2 (if i is odd) or 2 and -3 (if i is even), stdin contains t-2 lines of input.**

The code appends the element of array at index a[-1] to answer, and then decrements the value of a[-1] by 1. The value of i is 3, which is odd, so the last element of array is used for the second and third elements of answer. The value of a[-1] is either -1 (if i is odd) or -2 (if i is even), so the element of array at index a[-1] is either the last element (if i is odd) or the second last element (if i is even). After decrementing a[-1] by 1, its value becomes either -2 (if i is odd) or -3 (if i is even).
