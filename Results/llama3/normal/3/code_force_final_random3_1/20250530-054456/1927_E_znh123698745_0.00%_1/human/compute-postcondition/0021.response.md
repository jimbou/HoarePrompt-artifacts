To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `i` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing 1 element, `a` is a list containing 1 and -1, `stdin` contains at least `t-n-2` lines of input**
