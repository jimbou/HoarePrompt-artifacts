Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing a single element 1, a is a list containing 1 and -1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if (-1) ** i == -1:
        answer.append(array[a[-1]])
        a[-1] -= 1
    else:
        answer.append(array[a[0]])
        a[0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing two elements 1 and either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), a is a list containing either 1 and -2 (if i is odd) or 2 and -1 (if i is even), stdin contains t-1 lines of input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing four elements 1, either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), and either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the third element of array (if i is even), a is a list containing either 1 and -1 (if i is odd) or 0 and -2 (if i is even) or 3 and -1 (if i is odd) or 2 and -2 (if i is even), stdin contains t-2 lines of input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 3, i is 3, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n. If i is odd, answer is a list containing five elements 1, the last element of array, the last element of array, the last element of array, and the element of array at index a[-1]. If i is even, answer is a list containing five elements 1, the second element of array, the second element of array, the third element of array, and either the first element of array or the second element of array. a is a list containing either 1 and -2, 0 and -3, 3 and -2, or 2 and -3 if i is odd, or 2 and -1, 1 and -2, 4 and -1, or 3 and -2 if i is even. stdin contains t-2 lines of input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
