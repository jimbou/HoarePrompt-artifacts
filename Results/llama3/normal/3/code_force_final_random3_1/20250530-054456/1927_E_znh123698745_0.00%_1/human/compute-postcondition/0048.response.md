Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input, i is an integer greater than 2, answer is a list containing 1 and either the last element of array if i is odd or the first element of array if i is even, a is a list containing either 3 and -2 if i is odd or 3 and -1 if i is even.**

The code modifies the `answer` list and the `a` list. The `answer` list is appended with either the last element of `array` if `i` is odd or the first element of `array` if `i` is even. The `a` list has its first element incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `array`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
