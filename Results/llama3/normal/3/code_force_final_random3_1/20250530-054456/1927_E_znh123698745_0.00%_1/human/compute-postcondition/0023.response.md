Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, i is 1, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing 2 elements, a is a list containing 1 and -2, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input.**

The code block modifies the `answer` list by appending the element at the index specified by the last element of the `a` list, which is initially -1, to the `answer` list. Since `a` is a list containing 1 and -1, and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, the element appended to `answer` is the last element of `array`, which is `n`. The `answer` list now contains two elements: the initial element and `n`.

The code also modifies the last element of the `a` list by decrementing it by 1. Since the last element of `a` is initially -1, it becomes -2 after the decrement operation.

The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `array` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The `stdin` input remains unchanged as well, as the code does not interact with it.
