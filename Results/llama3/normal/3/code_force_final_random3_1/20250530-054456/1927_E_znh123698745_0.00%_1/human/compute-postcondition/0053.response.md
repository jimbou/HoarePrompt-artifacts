Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-3 lines of input, i is an integer greater than 3. If i is odd, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array, and a is a list containing 1 and -2 if (-1)^i equals 1, or 1 and -3 if (-1)^i equals -1, or 3 and -2 if (-1)^i equals 1. If i is even, answer is a list containing 1 and the first element of array, and a is a list containing 2 and -1 if (-1)^i equals 1, or 2 and -2 if (-1)^i equals -1, or 3 and -1 if (-1)^i equals 1.**
