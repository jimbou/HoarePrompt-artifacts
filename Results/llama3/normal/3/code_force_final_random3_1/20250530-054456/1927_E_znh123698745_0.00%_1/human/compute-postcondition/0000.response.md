The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If the `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the `input()` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be at least 1**
