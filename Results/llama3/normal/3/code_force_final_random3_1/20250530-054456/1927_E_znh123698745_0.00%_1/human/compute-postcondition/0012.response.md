The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer greater than 3, i is 3, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing four elements 1, either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), and either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the third element of array (if i is even), a is a list containing either 1 and -1 (if i is odd) or 0 and -2 (if i is even) or 3 and -1 (if i is odd) or 2 and -2 (if i is even), stdin contains t-2 lines of input.**
