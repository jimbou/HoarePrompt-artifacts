Based on the initial state, the `answer` list contains either 1 and the last element of `array` if `n` is odd, or 1 and the first element of `array` if `n` is even.

Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, the last element of `array` is `n` and the first element of `array` is 1.

If `n` is odd, the `answer` list contains 1 and `n`, so the print statement will output `1` and `n`.

If `n` is even, the `answer` list contains 1 and 1, so the print statement will output `1` and `1`.

Therefore, the output will be either `1` and `n` if `n` is odd, or `1` and `1` if `n` is even.

Output: **1, n (if n is odd) or 1, 1 (if n is even)**
