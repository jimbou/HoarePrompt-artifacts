Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5), where k is even.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(range(1, n + 1))
    answer = [1]
    a = [1, -1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (-1) ** i == -1:
            answer.append(array[a[-1]])
            a[-1] -= 1
        else:
            answer.append(array[a[0]])
            a[0] += 1
    print(*answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, i is n, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing n+1 elements, a is a list containing either 1 and -n or n and -1, stdin contains t-n lines of input, and the answer list containing n+1 elements is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, i is 1, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing n elements, a is a list containing n and -n+1, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input, and the elements of the answer list are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n lines of input, i is an integer equal to n, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array if n is odd, or 1 and the first element of array if n is even, and a is a list containing 1 and -n+1 if n is odd, or a list containing n and -1 if n is even, and the answer is printed which is either [1, n] if n is odd or [1, 1] if n is even




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
