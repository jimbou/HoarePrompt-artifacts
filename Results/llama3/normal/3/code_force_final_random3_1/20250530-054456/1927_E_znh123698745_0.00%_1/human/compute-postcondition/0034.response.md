Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`. If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list containing 4 elements (the original 3 elements and either the second last or the last element of the `array` list), `a` is a list containing either 1 and -4 or 2 and -3, and `stdin` contains at least `t-n-2` lines of input. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list containing 4 elements (the original 3 elements and the element of the `array` list at index `a[0]`), `a` is a list containing either 2 and -3, 3 and -2, 1 and -1, or 2 and -2, and `stdin` contains at least `t-n-3` lines of input. In all cases, `i` is an integer greater than 1.**
