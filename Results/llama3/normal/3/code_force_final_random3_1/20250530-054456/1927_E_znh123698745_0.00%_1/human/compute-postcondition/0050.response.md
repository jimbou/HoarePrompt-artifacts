To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-3 lines of input, i is an integer greater than 3. If i is odd, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array, and a is a list containing 1 and -2, with the last element of a decremented by 1 if (-1)^i equals -1, otherwise a is a list containing 3 and -2. If i is even, answer is a list containing 1 and the first element of array, and a is a list containing 2 and -1, with the last element of a decremented by 1 if (-1)^i equals -1, otherwise a is a list containing 3 and -1.**
