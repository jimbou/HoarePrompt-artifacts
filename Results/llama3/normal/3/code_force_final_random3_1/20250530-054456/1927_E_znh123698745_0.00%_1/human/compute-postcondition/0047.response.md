Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input, i is an integer greater than 2, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array if i is odd, or 1 and the first element of array if i is even, a is a list containing 1 and -2 if i is odd, or 2 and -1 if i is even, and the last element of a is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of n, k, array, stdin, and i remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list 'answer' is updated based on the parity of 'i'. If 'i' is odd, 'answer' contains 1 and the last element of 'array'. If 'i' is even, 'answer' contains 1 and the first element of 'array'. The list 'a' is also updated based on the parity of 'i'. If 'i' is odd, 'a' contains 1 and -2. If 'i' is even, 'a' contains 2 and -1. Additionally, the last element of 'a' is decremented by 1.
