Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, i is 1, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing 1, a is a list containing 1 and -1, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input.**

In this final state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers input by the user, replacing their initial values. The list `array` is recreated to contain integers from 1 to the new value of `n`. The list `answer` is reset to contain only the element 1. The list `a` is recreated to contain the elements 1 and -1. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains at least `t-n-2` lines of input, as two lines have been consumed by the `input()` function.
