Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the elements of the `answer` list, which contains `n+1` elements.

Since `answer` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the print statement will output all the elements of the list, separated by spaces.

The exact values of the elements in the `answer` list are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output as the elements of the `answer` list, which contains `n+1` elements.

Output: **elements of the answer list (where answer is a list containing n+1 elements)**
