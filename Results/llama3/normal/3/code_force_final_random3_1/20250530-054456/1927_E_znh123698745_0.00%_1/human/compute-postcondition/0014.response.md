Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, i is 3, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing five elements 1, either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), either the last element of array (if i is odd) or the third element of array (if i is even), and either the first element of array (if i is odd) or the second element of array (if i is even), a is a list containing either 2 and -1 (if i is odd) or 1 and -2 (if i is even) or 4 and -1 (if i is odd) or 3 and -2 (if i is even), stdin contains t-2 lines of input.**

Explanation: The first line appends the element of array at index a[0] to answer. Since i is 3 (odd), a[0] is either 1 or 3, so the appended element is either the second element of array or the fourth element of array. The second line increments a[0] by 1. Since a[0] was either 1 or 3, it becomes either 2 or 4. The value of a[1] remains unchanged. No other variables are affected.
