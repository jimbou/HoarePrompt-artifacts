Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, i is 1, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing 1, a is a list containing 1 and -1, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if (-1) ** i == -1:
        answer.append(array[a[-1]])
        a[-1] -= 1
    else:
        answer.append(array[a[0]])
        a[0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input. If i is odd, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array, and a is a list containing 1 and -2. If i is even, answer is a list containing 1 and the first element of array, and a is a list containing 2 and -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input, i is an integer greater than 2. If i is odd, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array, and a is a list containing 1 and -2, with the last element of a decremented by 1 if (-1)^i equals -1, otherwise a is a list containing 3 and -2. If i is even, answer is a list containing 1 and the first element of array, and a is a list containing 2 and -1, with the last element of a decremented by 1 if (-1)^i equals -1, otherwise a is a list containing 3 and -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-3 lines of input, i is an integer greater than 3. If i is odd, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array, and a is a list containing 1 and -2 if (-1)^i equals 1, or 1 and -3 if (-1)^i equals -1, or 3 and -2 if (-1)^i equals 1. If i is even, answer is a list containing 1 and the first element of array, and a is a list containing 2 and -1 if (-1)^i equals 1, or 2 and -2 if (-1)^i equals -1, or 3 and -1 if (-1)^i equals 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
