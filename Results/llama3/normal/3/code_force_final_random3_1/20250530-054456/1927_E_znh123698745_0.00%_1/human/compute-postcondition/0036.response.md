Based on the precondition, the `answer` list contains `n` elements. The `print(*answer)` statement will print all the elements of the `answer` list.

Since the exact values of the elements in the `answer` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `answer` list.

Output: **The elements of the answer list (where answer is a list containing n elements)**
