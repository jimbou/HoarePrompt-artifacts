Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input, i is an integer greater than 2. If i is odd, answer is a list containing 1 and the last element of array, and a is a list containing 1 and -2, with the last element of a decremented by 1 if (-1)^i equals -1, otherwise a is a list containing 3 and -2. If i is even, answer is a list containing 1 and the first element of array, and a is a list containing 2 and -1, with the last element of a decremented by 1 if (-1)^i equals -1, otherwise a is a list containing 3 and -1.**
