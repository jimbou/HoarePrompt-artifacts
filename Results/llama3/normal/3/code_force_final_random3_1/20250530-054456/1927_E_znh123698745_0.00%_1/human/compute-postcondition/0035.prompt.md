Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, i is n, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing 1 element, a is a list containing 1 and -1, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if (-1) ** i == -1:
        answer.append(array[a[-1]])
        a[-1] -= 1
    else:
        answer.append(array[a[0]])
        a[0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input. If i is odd, answer is a list containing 2 elements and a is a list containing 1 and -2. If i is even, answer is a list containing 2 elements and a is a list containing 2 and -1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n. If i is odd, answer is a list containing 3 elements (the original 2 elements and either the second last or the last element of the array list), a is a list containing either 1 and -3 or 2 and -2, and stdin contains at least t-n-2 lines of input. If i is even, answer is a list containing 3 elements, a is a list containing either 2 and -1 or 1 and -2, and stdin contains at least t-n-3 lines of input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`. If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list containing 4 elements (the original 3 elements and either the second last or the last element of the `array` list), `a` is a list containing either 1 and -4 or 2 and -3, and `stdin` contains at least `t-n-2` lines of input. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list containing 4 elements (the original 3 elements and the element of the `array` list at index `a[0]`), `a` is a list containing either 2 and -3, 3 and -2, 1 and -1, or 2 and -2, and `stdin` contains at least `t-n-3` lines of input. In all cases, `i` is an integer greater than 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
