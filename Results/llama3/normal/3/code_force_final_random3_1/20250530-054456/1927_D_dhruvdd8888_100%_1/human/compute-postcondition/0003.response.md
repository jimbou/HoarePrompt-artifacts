Output State: **N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, arr is a list containing a tuple (1, 0, num), stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include a tuple containing the values 1, 0, and `num`, which is the first integer in `nums`. The value of `s` has also been updated to be equal to `i`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
