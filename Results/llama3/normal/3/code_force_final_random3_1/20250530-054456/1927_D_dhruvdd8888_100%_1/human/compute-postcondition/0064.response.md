Based on the precondition, the `print` statement will print two values: `-1` and `-1`.

The values of the variables `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, `t`, `n`, `q`, `N`, `i`, `nums`, `num`, `arr`, and `LA` are not relevant to the output of the `print` statement, as they are not used in the statement.

Therefore, the output will be two literal values: `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
