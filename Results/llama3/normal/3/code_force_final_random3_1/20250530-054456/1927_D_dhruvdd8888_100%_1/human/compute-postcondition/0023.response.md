Based on the initial state, the code prints the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`. Since `s` is either 0 or N, and the current value of `s` is greater than `l` and not greater than `r`, we can infer that `s` is within the range of `l` and `r`.

Output: **s - 1 (where s - 1 is the value of s minus 1), s (where s is the current value of s, which is either 0 or N, and is within the range of l and r)**
