Postcondition: ***N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or N, e is either 0 or 1 + s, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains t - 1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q - 1 pairs of integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is an integer, s is either 0 or N, e is either 0 or 1 + s. s is less than or equal to l. If e is greater than or equal to r, then -1, -1 is printed. If e is strictly less than r, then if e is less than N or less than l, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, if e is greater than or equal to N and e is greater than or equal to l, then (-1, -1) is printed.***
