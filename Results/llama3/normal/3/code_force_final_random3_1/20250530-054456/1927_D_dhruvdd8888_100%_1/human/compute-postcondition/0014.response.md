Output State: **N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or N, e is 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of N will be at least 0, indicating that the loop executed at least once.
* The value of i will be equal to N, indicating that the loop iterated N times.
* The list nums will remain unchanged, containing n integers followed by -1.
* The value of s will be either 0 or N, depending on whether the last integer in nums is equal to the first integer in nums.
* The value of e will remain 0, as it is not affected by the loop.
* The value of num will be -1, as it is assigned the value of nums[i] in the last iteration, where i is N.
* The list arr will contain tuples of the form (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num. This means that arr will store the indices and values of the integers in nums that are different from the previous integer.
* The stdin will remain unchanged, containing t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.
