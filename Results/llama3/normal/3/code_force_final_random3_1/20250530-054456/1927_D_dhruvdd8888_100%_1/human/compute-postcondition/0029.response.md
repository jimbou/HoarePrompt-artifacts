Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the values -1 and -1.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The print statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
* There are no variables or objects being printed, only literal values.
* The values -1 and -1 are printed as is, without any modification or calculation.

Therefore, the output will be the literal values -1 and -1, separated by a space.

Output: **-1 -1**
