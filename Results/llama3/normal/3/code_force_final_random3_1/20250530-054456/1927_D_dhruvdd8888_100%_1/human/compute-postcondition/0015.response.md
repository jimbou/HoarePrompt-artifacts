Output State: **N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or N, e is 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of LA has been updated to be the second last index of arr. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 sequences of inputs.
