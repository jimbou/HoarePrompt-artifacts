To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 0, because the range function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to but not including the stop value, which is `N + 1` in this case.

State: **`N` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of n integers followed by -1, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in `nums`, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers**
