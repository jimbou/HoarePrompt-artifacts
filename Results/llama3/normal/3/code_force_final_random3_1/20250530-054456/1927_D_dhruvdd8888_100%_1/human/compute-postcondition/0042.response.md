Output State: **N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or N, e is either 0 or 1 + s, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains t - 3 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q - 2 pairs of integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is an integer, s is either 0 or N and is either less than or equal to l or greater than r, e is either 0 or 1 + s and is either less than l or greater than or equal to r.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to the two integers input from stdin, and stdin now contains `t - 3` sequences of inputs. The value of `eli` has been updated to the insertion point of `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr` to maintain sorted order. The values of `s` and `e` have been updated to the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The relationship between `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
