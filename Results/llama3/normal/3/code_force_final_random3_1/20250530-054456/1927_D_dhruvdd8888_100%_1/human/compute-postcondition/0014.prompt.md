Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, arr is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, if the first integer in nums is not equal to the first integer in nums, then arr is a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums). Otherwise, no changes are made to arr, stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is at least 0, i is 1, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums, arr is either a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), and a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums) or a list containing a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums). Stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is at least 1, i is 2, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or 2, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums, arr is either a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), and a tuple (1 + s, i, the second integer in nums) or a list containing a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums) and a tuple (1 + s, i, the second integer in nums). Stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
