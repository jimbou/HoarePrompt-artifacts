Output: *N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or N, e is either 0 or 1 + s, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains t - 1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q - 1 pairs of integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is an integer, the current value of s is greater than l, and e is either 0 or 1 + s, s is not equal to 1 and s is not greater than r, and the following is printed: s - 1, s (where s is either 0 or N, and s - 1 is one less than s)*
