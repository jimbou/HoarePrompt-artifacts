Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality by first processing the input array to find the sequences of identical integers and storing their start and end indices in the `arr` list. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the first sequence that overlaps with the given range `[l, r]`. If such a sequence is found, it prints the start and end indices of the sequence. If no such sequence is found, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the range `[l, r]` does not overlap with any sequence of identical integers.

Correctness: **True**
