Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the values of two variables: `-1` and `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The precondition states that `num` is `-1`. This is a direct assignment, so we can confidently say that `num` has a value of `-1`.
* The print statement `print(-1, -1)` simply prints the values of two literals, which are both `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be the two `-1` values, separated by a space (since they are printed as separate arguments to the `print` function).

Output: **-1 -1**
