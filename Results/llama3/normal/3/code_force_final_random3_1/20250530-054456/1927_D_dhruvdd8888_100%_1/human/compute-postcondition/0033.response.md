The code prints the value of `s` and the value of `e + 1`. Based on the precondition, `s` is either 0 or N, and `e` is either 0 or 1 + s. Since `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is strictly less than `r`, we can conclude that `s` and `e` are both less than `r`.

Output: **s (which is either 0 or N), e + 1 (which is either 1 or 1 + s, where s is either 0 or N)**
