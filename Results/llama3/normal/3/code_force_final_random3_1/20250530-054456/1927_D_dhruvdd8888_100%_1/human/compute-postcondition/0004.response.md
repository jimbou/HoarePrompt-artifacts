Postcondition: ***N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, if nums[i] is not equal to num, then arr is a list containing a tuple (1, 0, num). Otherwise, no changes are made to arr. stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.***
