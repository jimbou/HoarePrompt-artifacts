Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, arr is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**

Explanation:

* The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to N. This consumes the first input from stdin.
* The second line reads a list of n integers from stdin and assigns it to nums. This consumes the second input from stdin.
* The third line initializes s to 0.
* The fourth line initializes e to 0.
* The fifth line assigns the first integer in nums to num.
* The sixth line initializes arr as an empty list.
* The seventh line appends -1 to the end of nums.

After executing the entire code block, the state of the variables is as follows:

* N is an integer, which was read from stdin.
* nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, which was read from stdin and modified by appending -1.
* s is 0, which was initialized by the code.
* e is 0, which was initialized by the code.
* num is the first integer in nums, which was assigned by the code.
* arr is an empty list, which was initialized by the code.
* stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs, which were not consumed by the code. Each sequence consists of an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer q, and q pairs of integers.
