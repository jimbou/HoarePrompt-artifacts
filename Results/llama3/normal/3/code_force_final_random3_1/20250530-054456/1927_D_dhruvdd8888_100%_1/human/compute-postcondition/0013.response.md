Output State: **N is at least 1, i is 2, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or 2, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums, arr is either a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), and a tuple (1 + s, i, the second integer in nums) or a list containing a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums) and a tuple (1 + s, i, the second integer in nums). Stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be the second integer in the list `nums`, since `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 sequences of inputs.
