This function reads a sequence of inputs from standard input, where each sequence consists of an integer t, followed by t sequences of an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer q, and q pairs of integers. It then processes these inputs to find the first and last indices of the first sequence of identical integers that overlap with a given range [l, r] for each query. If no such sequence exists, it prints (-1, -1). The function continues this process until all queries have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
