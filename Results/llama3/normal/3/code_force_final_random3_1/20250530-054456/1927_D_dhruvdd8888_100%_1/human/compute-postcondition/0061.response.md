Based on the precondition, we can analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is `print(s - 1, s)`. We need to determine the values of `s - 1` and `s`.

From the precondition, we know that `s` is either 0 or N, and it is either less than or equal to `l` or greater than `r`. We also know that `e` is either 0 or 1 + `s`, and it is either less than `l` or greater than or equal to `r`.

Since `s` is either 0 or N, we can consider two cases:

Case 1: `s` is 0. In this case, `s - 1` would be -1.

Case 2: `s` is N. In this case, `s - 1` would be N - 1.

Now, let's consider the value of `s`. Since `s` is either 0 or N, we can say that `s` is either 0 or a non-negative integer (since N is at least 0).

Therefore, the output of the print statement would be either (-1, 0) or (N - 1, N), depending on the value of `s`.

Output: **(-1, 0) or (N - 1, N)**
