Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program uses a binary search approach to find the first and last indices of the first sequence of identical integers that overlap with a given range [l, r] for each query. If no such sequence exists, it prints (-1, -1). The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the range [l, r] does not overlap with any sequence of identical integers, or when the sequence of identical integers is at the beginning or end of the array. The program also correctly handles the case when the input array contains only one distinct integer.

Correctness: **True**
