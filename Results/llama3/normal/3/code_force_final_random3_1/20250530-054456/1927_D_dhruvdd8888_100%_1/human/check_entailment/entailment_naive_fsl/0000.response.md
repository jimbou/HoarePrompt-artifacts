Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. It uses a binary search approach to find the pair of different elements in the array within the given range. The program first creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end indices of a subarray with the same elements, along with the element itself. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the appropriate tuple that corresponds to the given range. If the start index of the tuple is greater than the start of the range, it means that the previous subarray has a different element, so it prints the last element of the previous subarray and the first element of the current subarray. If the end index of the tuple is greater than or equal to the end of the range, it means that all elements in the range are the same, so it prints -1 -1. Otherwise, it prints the start index of the tuple and the end index of the tuple plus one.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the start of the range is 1, when the end of the range is equal to the length of the array, and when the range is entirely within a subarray with the same elements. The use of binary search ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large inputs.
