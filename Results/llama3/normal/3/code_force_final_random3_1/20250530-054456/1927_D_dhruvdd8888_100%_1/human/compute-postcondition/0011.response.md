Output State: **N is at least 1, i is 2, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 2, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums, arr is either a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), and a tuple (1 + s, i, num) or a list containing a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums) and a tuple (1 + s, i, num). Stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**

The code modifies the value of `s` and appends a new tuple to the list `arr`. The value of `s` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2. The list `arr` is extended with a new tuple containing the values `(1 + s, i, num)`, where `s` is the updated value (2), `i` is 2, and `num` is the second integer in `nums`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
