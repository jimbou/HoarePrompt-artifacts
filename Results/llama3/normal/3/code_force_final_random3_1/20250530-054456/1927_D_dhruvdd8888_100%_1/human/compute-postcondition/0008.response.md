Postcondition: ***N is at least 0, i is 1, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums. If the first integer in nums is not equal to the second integer in nums, then arr is a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), and a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums). Otherwise, arr is a list containing a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums). Stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.***
