The code prints the value of `s` and the value of `e + 1`. 

`s` is either 0 or N, and is either less than or equal to `l` or greater than `r`. `e` is either 0 or 1 + `s`, and is either less than `l` or greater than or equal to `r`. 

Since `s` and `e` have multiple possible values, we can't determine their exact values. However, we can describe their values based on the given conditions.

Output: **s (where s is either 0 or N and is either less than or equal to l or greater than r), e + 1 (where e is either 0 or 1 + s and is either less than l or greater than or equal to r)**
