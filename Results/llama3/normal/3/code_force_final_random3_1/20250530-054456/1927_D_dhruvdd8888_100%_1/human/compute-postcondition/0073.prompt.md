Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or N, e is 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or N, e is either 0 or 1 + s, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains t - 1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q - 1 pairs of integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is an integer. If s > l, then if s is either 1 or greater than r, (-1, -1) is printed. Otherwise, s - 1, s is printed where s is either 0 or N. If s is less than or equal to l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, then -1, -1 is printed. If e is strictly less than r, then if e is less than N or less than l, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, if e is greater than or equal to N and e is greater than or equal to l, then (-1, -1) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is either 0 or N, e is either 0 or 1 + s, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains t - 3 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q - 2 pairs of integers, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is an integer, s is either 0 or N and is either less than or equal to l or greater than r, e is either 0 or 1 + s and is either less than l or greater than or equal to r. If s is greater than l, then -1, -1 is printed. If s is less than or equal to l and e is greater than or equal to r, then -1, -1 are printed. If s is less than or equal to l and e is less than r, then s - 1 and s are printed if s is 1 or greater than r. Otherwise, if e is less than N or less than l, then (s, e + 1) is printed where s is either 0 or N and e + 1 is either 1 or N + 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *l and r are integers, eli is an integer, s is either 0 or N and is either less than or equal to l or greater than r, e is either 0 or 1 + s and is either less than l or greater than or equal to r, stdin contains t - 5 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q - 4 pairs of integers, N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr. If s is greater than l, then if s is 1 or s is greater than r, -1 and -1 are printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1 and -1 are printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N or less than l, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, the values -1 and -1 are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
