Output State: **N is at least 0, i is 1, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums, arr is either a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), and a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums) or a list containing a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums). Stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of num has been updated to be the second integer in the list nums. The other variables remain unchanged. The list arr still contains the same tuples as before, depending on whether the first integer in nums is equal to the second integer in nums. The stdin still contains the same input sequences.
