The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be at least 1.
State: **N is at least 1, i is 2, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums, arr is either a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums), a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums), and a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums) or a list containing a tuple (2, 1, the second integer in nums). Stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**
