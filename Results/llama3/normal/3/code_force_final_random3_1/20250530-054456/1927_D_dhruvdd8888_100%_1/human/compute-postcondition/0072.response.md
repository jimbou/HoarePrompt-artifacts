Postcondition: ***l and r are integers, eli is an integer, s is either 0 or N and is either less than or equal to l or greater than r, e is either 0 or 1 + s and is either less than l or greater than or equal to r, stdin contains t - 5 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q - 4 pairs of integers, N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num, LA is the second last index of arr. If s is greater than l, then if s is 1 or s is greater than r, -1 and -1 are printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1 and -1 are printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N or less than l, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, the values -1 and -1 are printed.***
