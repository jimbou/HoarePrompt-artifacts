Output State: **N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of n integers followed by -1, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, if the first integer in nums is not equal to the first integer in nums, then arr is a list containing a tuple (1, 0, the first integer in nums). Otherwise, no changes are made to arr, stdin contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of num has been updated to be the first integer in nums. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for arr is still dependent on the comparison of the first integer in nums with itself, which will always be equal, so arr will not be changed.
