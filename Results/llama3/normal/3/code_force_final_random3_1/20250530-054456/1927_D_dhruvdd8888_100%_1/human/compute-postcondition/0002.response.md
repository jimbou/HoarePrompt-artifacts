Postcondition: **`N` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of n integers followed by -1, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in `nums`, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 sequences of inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, then q pairs of integers. The current value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
