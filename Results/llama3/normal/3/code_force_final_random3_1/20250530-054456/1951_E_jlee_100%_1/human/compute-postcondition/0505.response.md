Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `count2` is increased by 1, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the `string`, `n` is greater than 4, `j` is 4. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 4 and `done` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of `count2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
