Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 0. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s and count is less than 1, then count is set to j. Otherwise, count remains unchanged. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s, then done is True. Otherwise, done is False. The current value of count is greater than 0. The character at index j in s is not equal to x. count2 is greater than or equal to count. The current value of count2 is equal to the current value of count. count is less than or equal to 1***
