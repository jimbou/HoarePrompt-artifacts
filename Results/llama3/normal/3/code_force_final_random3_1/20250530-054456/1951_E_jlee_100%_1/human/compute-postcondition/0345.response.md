Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is n, n is greater than or equal to 0, done is False.**

Explanation:

The code block reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `string`. This reduces the number of strings in stdin by 1, making it `t-5` strings. The length of the string `s` is calculated and assigned to the variable `n`. The variable `done` is set to `False`, indicating that 'NO' is being printed. The variables `t`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
