Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 4, j is 4. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) is printed, and done is True.***
