Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is n, n is greater than or equal to 0, done is True, count is 0, count2 is 0.**

The loop will execute until j is equal to n. After the loop finishes executing, the value of j will be equal to n, and the value of done will be True. The values of count and count2 will be reset to 0. The other variables in the precondition will remain unchanged.
