Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2, done is False, count is 0, count2 is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count2 is increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The program still has t-1 strings in the standard input, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The string and its corresponding list of characters, as well as the first character of the string, are unchanged. The indices j and n, and the boolean variable done, also remain the same.
