Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 4, j is 4. If count2 is equal to count, then done is True if count is greater than 1 or if count is less than or equal to 1 and s[j] is not equal to x. Additionally, if count is less than 1 and s[j] is not equal to x, then count is 4. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
