Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 1. Otherwise, the values of done, count, and count2 remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of count2 has been incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions for done, count, and count2 also remain the same, with the only change being the updated value of count2.
