Postcondition: **The program has executed the if-else block, resulting in one of two possible outcomes. If the count is greater than 1, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the string, and sets done to True and count to 2. If the count is not greater than 1, the program sets count2 to 0 and done to False. In both cases, the program retains the initial values of t, i, stdin, string, s, x, j, and n, which remain unchanged throughout the execution of the if-else block.**
