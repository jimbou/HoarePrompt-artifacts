Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, done is True if count2 is less than count or count2 is greater than or equal to count and count is 1, otherwise done is False. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is 1. In both cases, count2 is greater than or equal to count. If count is less than or equal to 0, then the program continues with the same values, and 'YES' is printed**
