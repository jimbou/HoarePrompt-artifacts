Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 1. If s[j] is equal to x, then if count2 is less than count, then done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 0. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first j-1 characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string is printed. If count2 is equal to count and count is not greater than 1, nothing is printed. If count2 is not equal to count and count2 is greater than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first two characters of the string which are string[:j] are printed, and the rest of the string which is string[j:] is printed. In all cases, done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 0.***
