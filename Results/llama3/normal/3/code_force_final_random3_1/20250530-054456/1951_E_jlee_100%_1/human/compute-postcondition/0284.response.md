Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1, count2 is 0, count is 1, done is False.**

The code block introduces a new variable `count2` and assigns it the value 0. The `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
