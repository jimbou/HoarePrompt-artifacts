Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1. If count is greater than 1, then done is True. Otherwise, count2 is 0, count is 1, and done is False.**
