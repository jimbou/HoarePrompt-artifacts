To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `t` is indeed at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so we need to adjust its state to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

The state of `stdin` and the strings it contains is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). The sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
