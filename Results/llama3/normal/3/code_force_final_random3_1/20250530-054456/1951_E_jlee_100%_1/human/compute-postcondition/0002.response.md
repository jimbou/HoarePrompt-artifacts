Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). The sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is the length of the string, done is False.**

Explanation:
The first line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `string`. Since stdin contains `t` strings, after reading one string, it now contains `t-1` strings. The second line converts the string into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The third line calculates the length of the string and assigns it to the variable `n`. The fourth line assigns the value `False` to the variable `done`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
