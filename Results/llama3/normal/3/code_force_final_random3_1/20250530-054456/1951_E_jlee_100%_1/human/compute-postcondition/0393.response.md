Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 0. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s and count is less than 1, then count is set to j. Otherwise, count remains unchanged. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s, then done is True. Otherwise, done is False. The current value of count is greater than 0. The character at index j in s is not equal to x. The current value of count2 is less than the current value of count, and 'YES' is printed**
