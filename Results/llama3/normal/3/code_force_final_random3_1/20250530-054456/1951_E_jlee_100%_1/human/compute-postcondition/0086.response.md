Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string. If count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j-1 and printed. If count is 1, count2 is 0, and done is True. If count2 is greater than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at the jth character and both parts are printed: the first part is string[:j] and the second part is string[j:]. Otherwise, no additional actions are taken.***
