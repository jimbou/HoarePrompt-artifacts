Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 4, j is 4. If count is greater than 1, then done is True. If count is less than or equal to 1, then done is True if s[j] is not equal to x, otherwise done is unchanged. If count is less than 1 and s[j] is not equal to x, then count is 4, otherwise count is unchanged.***
