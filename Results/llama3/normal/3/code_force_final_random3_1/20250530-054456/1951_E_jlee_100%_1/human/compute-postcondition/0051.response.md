Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, if the jth character of the string is not equal to the first character of the string and count is less than 1, then count is set to j and done is True. Otherwise, the values of count, count2, n, j, and done remain unchanged.***
