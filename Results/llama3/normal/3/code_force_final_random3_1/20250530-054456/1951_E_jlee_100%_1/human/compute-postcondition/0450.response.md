The code prints the string `string` split into two parts: the first part consists of all characters before the index `j - 1` (which is 2), and the second part consists of all characters from index `j - 1` (which is 2) to the end of the string.

Since `j` is 3, `j - 1` is 2. Therefore, the first part of the string will contain the first two characters of `string`, and the second part will contain the third character and all subsequent characters.

Output: **the first two characters of the string, followed by the third character and all subsequent characters of the string**
