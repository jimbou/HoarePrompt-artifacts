Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string has a length of 2 and the two characters are different. In this case, the program should print "YES" and the string itself as the partition, but it does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is "ab", the program should print:

YES
1
ab

But the program does not handle this case correctly and does not print the expected output.
