Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the string, `x` is the first character of the string. The current value of `s` contains `n` occurrences of `x`, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.
