Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2. If count is greater than 0, then if count2 is less than count, done is True. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. Otherwise, count2 is 0, count is 1, and done is False. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1, and if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 1 and done is False. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values. If count is not greater than 0, then the program continues with the same values, and 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed**
