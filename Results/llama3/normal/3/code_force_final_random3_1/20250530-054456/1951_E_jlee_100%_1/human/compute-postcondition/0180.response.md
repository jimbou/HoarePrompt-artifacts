The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are already inside a loop, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the `string`, `x` is the first character of the `string`, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `done` is False, 'NO' is being printed, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
