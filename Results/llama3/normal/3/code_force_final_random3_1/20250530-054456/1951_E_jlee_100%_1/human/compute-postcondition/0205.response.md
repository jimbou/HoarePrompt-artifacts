Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the string, `x` is the first character of the string, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `done` is False. If `s.count(x)` is equal to `n`, 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to the last character of the string, 'YES' is being printed, the integer 1 is being printed, and the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`, then if `n` is odd and the middle character of the string is not equal to the first character, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed, the integer 1 is being printed, and the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) is being printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.***
