Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, the current value of j is 0, n must be greater than 0, if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, otherwise, done is False, count is greater than 0, count2 is greater than count, and count2 is not equal to count. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x. Additionally, the current value of count2 is greater than count, and 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and the first j characters of the string are being printed, and the rest of the string starting from index j is being printed**
