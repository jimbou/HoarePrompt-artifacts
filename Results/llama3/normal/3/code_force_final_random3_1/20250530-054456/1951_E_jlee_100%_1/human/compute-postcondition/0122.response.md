Based on the precondition, the code prints the first j characters of the string and the rest of the string starting from index j.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

*   `string[:j]`: This expression slices the string from the beginning up to but not including the character at index j. Since j is 1, this will print the first character of the string, which is x.
*   `string[j:]`: This expression slices the string from index j to the end. Since j is 1, this will print the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **x (the first character of the string), the rest of the string starting from the second character**
