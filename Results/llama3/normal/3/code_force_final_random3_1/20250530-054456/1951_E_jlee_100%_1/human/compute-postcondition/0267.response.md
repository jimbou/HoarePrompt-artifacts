Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, count2 is 1, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values.***
