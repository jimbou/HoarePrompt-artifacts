Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the string, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the string, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is being printed, and the string which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop, without changing the values of any variables. The program state remains the same as before, with all variables retaining their previous values. The only change is that the program skips to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further statements in the current iteration.
