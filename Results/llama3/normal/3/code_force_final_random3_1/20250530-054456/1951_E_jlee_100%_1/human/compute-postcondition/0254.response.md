Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 0, n is greater than 0, count is greater than 0. If count2 is less than count, then done is True. If count2 is greater than or equal to count, then done is True if count2 is greater than count or count is 1, otherwise done is False. In both cases, count2 is greater than or equal to count, and s[j] is not equal to x.**
