Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True, count is 2, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first two characters of the string which are [x] and the second character of the string which is [s[1]] are printed, and the rest of the string starting from the third character which is [s[2:]] is printed. Otherwise, done is False.***
