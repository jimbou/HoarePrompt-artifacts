Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the string, `x` is the first character of the string. The first character of the string is not equal to the last character of the string, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, the string is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. The count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`. The current value of `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`***
