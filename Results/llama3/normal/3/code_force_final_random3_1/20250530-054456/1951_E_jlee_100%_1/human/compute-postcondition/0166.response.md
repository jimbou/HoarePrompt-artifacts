Postcondition: **The program has executed the if-else block, resulting in one of two possible outcomes. If count2 is equal to count, then the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the string, and sets done to True and count to 2. If count2 is not equal to count, then the program either prints 'YES', the number 2, the first two characters of the string, and the rest of the string, and sets done to True and count to 2, or sets done to False. In all cases, the program retains the initial values of t, i, stdin, string, s, x, j, and n, which remain unchanged throughout the execution of the if-else block.**
