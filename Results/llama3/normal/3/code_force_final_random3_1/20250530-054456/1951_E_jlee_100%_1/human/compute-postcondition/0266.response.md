Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1, done is True, count2 is 1, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed**

The code snippet sets the variable `done` to `True` and then breaks out of the loop. This means that the loop will terminate immediately, and the program will continue executing the code after the loop. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. The program then prints 'YES', 1, and the string.
