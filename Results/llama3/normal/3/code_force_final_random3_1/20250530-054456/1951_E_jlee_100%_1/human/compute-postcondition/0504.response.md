Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 4, j is 4. If count2 is less than count, then done is True, count is 4, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first 4 characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string starting from the 5th character is printed. If count2 is greater than or equal to count, then done is True if count is greater than 1 or if count is less than or equal to 1 and s[j] is not equal to x. Additionally, if count is less than 1 and s[j] is not equal to x, then count is 4. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
