Based on the precondition, the code will print 'YES' because the condition for printing 'YES' is met when the character at index j in the string is not equal to the character at index n-1-j and count is less than 1. Since done is set to True and count is set to 2 after printing 'YES', the print statement will only execute once.

Output: **YES**
