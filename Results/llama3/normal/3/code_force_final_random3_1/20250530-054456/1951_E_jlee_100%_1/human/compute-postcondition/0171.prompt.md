Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, count is 0, count2 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string. If count > 0, then if the jth character of the string is not equal to the first character of the string, then if count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j-1 and printed. If count is 1, count2 is 0, and done is True. If count2 is greater than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at the jth character and both parts are printed: the first part is string[:j] and the second part is string[j:]. Otherwise, count2 is increased by 1, indicating that the jth character of the string is equal to the first character of the string and done is True. If count is not greater than 0, then the values of count, count2, n, j, and done remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1. If count is greater than 0, the program executes an if-else block that checks the condition `s[j] != x`. If the condition is true, the program checks the values of `count` and `count2`. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count` is greater than 1 and `count2` equals `count`, `done` is set to True, the number 2 is printed, and a specific string is printed. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. If the condition `s[j] != x` is false, `count2` is increased by 1. Additionally, if the character at index `j` in the string is not equal to the character at index `n-1-j` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` remains False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program has executed the if-else block, retaining the initial values of t, i, stdin, string, s, x, j, and n. If count is greater than 0, the program has printed 'YES', the number 2, the first two characters of the string, and the rest of the string, and set done to True. If count is 0, the program has not executed the if-else block, and done remains False. In all cases, the program retains the initial values of t, i, stdin, string, s, x, j, and n, which remain unchanged throughout the execution of the if-else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
