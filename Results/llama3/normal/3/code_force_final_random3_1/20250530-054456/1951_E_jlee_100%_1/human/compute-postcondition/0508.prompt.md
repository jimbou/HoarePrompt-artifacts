Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is n, n is greater than or equal to 0, done is False, count is 0, count2 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 0. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x and count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first j characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string starting from index j is printed. If s[j] is not equal to x and count2 is greater than or equal to count, then no action is taken, and the value of done is determined based on the comparison of characters at index j and n-1-j in s. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1, done is True, and the character at index j in s is equal to x. If count is not greater than 0, then no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 3, j is 3. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is equal to x, count2 is increased by 1. If count2 is less than count, then done is True. If count2 is greater than or equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. If count is less than or equal to 1, then if s[j] is not equal to x, count is 3 and done is True, otherwise count and done remain unchanged. If count is less than or equal to 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 3 and done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 4, j is 4. If count is greater than 0, then done is True, count is 4, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first 4 characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string starting from the 5th character is printed if count2 is less than count. If count2 is greater than or equal to count, then done is True if count is greater than 1 or if count is less than or equal to 1 and s[j] is not equal to x. Additionally, if count is less than 1 and s[j] is not equal to x, then count is 4. Otherwise, count2 is increased by 1. If count is not greater than 0, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
