Based on the precondition, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(string[:j], string[j:])`

Here, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and `j` is an index into this string.

The expression `string[:j]` will print all characters in the string from the beginning up to, but not including, the character at index `j`.

The expression `string[j:]` will print all characters in the string starting from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `done` is `True` and `count2` is greater than `count`, it means that the loop has found a character in the string that is different from the first character `x`, and this character is at index `j`.

Therefore, the print statement will print two parts of the string:

1. The first part, `string[:j]`, will print all characters up to, but not including, the character at index `j`, which is the first character that is different from `x`.
2. The second part, `string[j:]`, will print all characters starting from the character at index `j`, which is the first character that is different from `x`, to the end of the string.

Output: **the substring of string up to the first character that is different from x, followed by the substring of string starting from the first character that is different from x to the end of the string**
