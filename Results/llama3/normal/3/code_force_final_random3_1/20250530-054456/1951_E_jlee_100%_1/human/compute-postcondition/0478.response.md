Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 4, j is 4. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 4 and done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
