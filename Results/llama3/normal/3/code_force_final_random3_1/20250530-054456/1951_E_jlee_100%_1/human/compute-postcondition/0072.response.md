Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string. The current value of count is 1, indicating that the jth character of the string is equal to the first character of the string and done is True. Additionally, the current value of s[j] is equal to x, meaning the jth character of the string is the same as the first character of the string. count2 is equal to count, meaning that the current value of count2 is also equal to the current value of count, which is equal to 1.***
