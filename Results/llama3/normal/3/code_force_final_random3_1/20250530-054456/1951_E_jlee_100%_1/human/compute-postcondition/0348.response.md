Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is n, n is greater than or equal to 0, done is False, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.
