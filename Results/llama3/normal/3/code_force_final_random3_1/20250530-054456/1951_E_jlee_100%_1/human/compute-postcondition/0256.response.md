Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, j is 0, n must be greater than 0, if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, otherwise, done is False, count is greater than 0, count2 is 1. s[j] is equal to x**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count2 has been incremented by 1, and it is now equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
