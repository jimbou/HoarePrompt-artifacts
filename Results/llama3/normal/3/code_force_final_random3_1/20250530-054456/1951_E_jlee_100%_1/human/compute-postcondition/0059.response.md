The code prints two substrings of the string. The first substring is from the beginning of the string to the jth character (exclusive), and the second substring is from the jth character to the end of the string.

Since the value of j is not explicitly provided, we can't determine the exact substrings that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output two substrings of the string.

Output: **string[:j] (the substring from the beginning of the string to the jth character) and string[j:] (the substring from the jth character to the end of the string)**
