Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the string, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `done` is False. If `s.count(x)` is equal to `n`, then 'NO' is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration. If `s.count(x)` is not equal to `n`, then if the first character of the string is not equal to the last character of the string, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`, then if `n` is odd and the middle character of the string is not equal to `x`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed. We skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with its normal execution.**
