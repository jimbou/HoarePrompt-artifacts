Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is n, n is greater than or equal to 0, done is False. If n is equal to 1, then 'NO' is printed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with its normal execution.***
