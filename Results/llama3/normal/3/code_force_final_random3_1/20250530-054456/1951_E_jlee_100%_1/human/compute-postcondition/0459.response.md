Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6.
* `s` is a list of characters in the `string`.
* `j` is an integer with a value of 3.
* `string[:j]` will print the first 3 characters of the `string`.
* `string[j:]` will print the rest of the `string` starting from the 4th character (since indexing starts at 0).

Therefore, the `print` statement will print the first 3 characters of the `string` followed by the rest of the `string` starting from the 4th character.

Output: **the first 3 characters of the string, followed by the rest of the string starting from the 4th character**
