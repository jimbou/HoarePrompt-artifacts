Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1. If count is greater than 1 and count2 equals count, then done is True, the number 2 is printed, and the first j-1 characters of the string which is equal to the first character of the string which is x and the rest of the string starting from the jth character which is equal to the rest of the string starting from the second character is printed. If count2 is greater than count, then done is set to True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
