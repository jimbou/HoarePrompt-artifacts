Based on the given precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

Here, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6.

`j` is an integer with a value of 2.

The expression `string[:j - 1]` means "get all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`". Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. So, this expression will get the first character of the string, which is `x`.

The expression `string[j - 1:]` means "get all characters from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string". Again, since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. So, this expression will get all characters of the string starting from the second character (at index 1) to the end.

Therefore, the print statement will print the first character of the string (`x`) followed by the rest of the string (from the second character to the end).

Output: **x (the first character of the string) followed by the rest of the string (from the second character to the end)**
