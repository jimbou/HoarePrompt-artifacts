Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, count2 is increased by 1, count is greater than 0, indicating that the jth character of the string is equal to the first character of the string and done is True.**

In this output state, the value of count2 has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `i`, stdin, string, `s`, `x`, count, and done. The conditions on the values of these variables also remain the same.
