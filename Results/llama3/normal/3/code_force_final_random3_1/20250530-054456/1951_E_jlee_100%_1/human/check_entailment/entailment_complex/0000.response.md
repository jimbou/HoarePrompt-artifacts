Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. The program handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including strings of length 1, strings consisting of the same character, and strings that can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings.

The program uses a flag `done` to track whether a valid partition has been found for a given string. If a valid partition is found, the program prints 'YES', the number of partitions, and the resulting substrings. If no valid partition is found after checking all possible partitions, the program prints 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input string is already a non-palindrome, in which case it prints 'YES', 1, and the original string.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
