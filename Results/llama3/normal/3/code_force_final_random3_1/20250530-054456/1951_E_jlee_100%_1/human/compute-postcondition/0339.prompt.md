Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, j is n, n is greater than or equal to 0, done is False, count is 0, count2 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 0, n is greater than 0. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, done is True if count2 is less than count or count2 is greater than or equal to count and count is 1, otherwise done is False. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is 1. In both cases, count2 is greater than or equal to count. If count is less than or equal to 0, then the program continues with the same values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1. If count is greater than 0, then if count2 is less than count, done is True. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. Otherwise, count2 is 0, count is 1, and done is False. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1, and if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 1 and done is False. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values. If count is not greater than 0, then the program continues with the same values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2. If count is greater than 0, then done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 0. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 1. If s[j] is equal to x, then if count2 is less than count, then done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 0. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first j-1 characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string is printed. If count2 is equal to count and count is not greater than 1, nothing is printed. If count2 is not equal to count and count2 is greater than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first two characters of the string which are string[:j] are printed, and the rest of the string which is string[j:] is printed. Otherwise, the values of done, count, and count2 remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
