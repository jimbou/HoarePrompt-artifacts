Postcondition: **The program has executed the if-else block, resulting in one of two possible outcomes. If the character at index j in the string is not equal to the first character of the string, then the program prints 'YES', the number 2, the first two characters of the string, and the rest of the string, and sets done to True. If the character at index j in the string is equal to the first character of the string, then count2 is increased by 1, and done is False. In all cases, the program retains the initial values of t, i, stdin, string, s, x, j, and n, which remain unchanged throughout the execution of the if-else block.**
