The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the `string`, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3**
