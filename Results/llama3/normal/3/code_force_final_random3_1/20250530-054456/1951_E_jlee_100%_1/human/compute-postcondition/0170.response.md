Postcondition: ***The program has executed the if-else block, retaining the initial values of t, i, stdin, string, s, x, j, and n. If count is greater than 0, the program has printed 'YES', the number 2, the first two characters of the string, and the rest of the string, and set done to True. If count is 0, the program has not executed the if-else block, and done remains False. In all cases, the program retains the initial values of t, i, stdin, string, s, x, j, and n, which remain unchanged throughout the execution of the if-else block.***
