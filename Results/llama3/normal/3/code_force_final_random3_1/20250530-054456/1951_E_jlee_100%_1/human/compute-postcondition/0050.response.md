Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, count is j, count2 is 0, n is at least 1, j is 0, done is True.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of j to count. Since the current value of jth character of the string is not equal to the first character of the string and the current value of count is less than 1, the value of count becomes j. The second line is a continue statement, which does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
