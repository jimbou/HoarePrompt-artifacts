Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 0. If count2 is less than count, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first j characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string starting from index j is printed. If count2 is greater than or equal to count, then no action is taken, and the value of done is determined based on the comparison of characters at index j and n-1-j in s.**
