Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the string, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `done` is False, 'NO' is printed, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
