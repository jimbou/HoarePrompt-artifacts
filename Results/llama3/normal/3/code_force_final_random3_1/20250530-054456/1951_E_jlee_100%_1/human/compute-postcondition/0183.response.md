Based on the precondition, the code will print 'YES' only if the current string is not the first string (i.e., `i` is not equal to 1) and `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is equal to 1, the loop will move on to the next iteration, and 'YES' will not be printed.

Since 'NO' is being printed before the loop, it means that the condition for printing 'YES' is not met for the first string (or strings) in the input.

Therefore, the output will be 'YES' only if the loop iterates over the remaining strings (i.e., `i` is greater than 1) and `n` is not equal to 1.

Output: **YES (if i > 1 and n != 1)**
