The code prints the string sliced into two parts: the first part from the beginning to index j (which is 4), and the second part from index j to the end of the string. Since j is 4, the first part will contain the first 4 characters of the string, and the second part will contain the remaining characters.

Output: **string[:4] (the first 4 characters of the string), string[4:] (the remaining characters of the string)**
