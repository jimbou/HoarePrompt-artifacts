Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 0. If count2 is equal to count, then done is True. If count is greater than 1, then count2 is greater than or equal to count. If count is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, then count2 is 0. If count2 is greater than count, then 'YES' is being printed, the number 2 is being printed, the first j characters of the string are being printed and the rest of the string starting from index j is being printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
