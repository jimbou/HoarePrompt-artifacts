Based on the precondition, the `print(string)` statement will print the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.

Since the exact string is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the string. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string.

Output: **string (where string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters)**
