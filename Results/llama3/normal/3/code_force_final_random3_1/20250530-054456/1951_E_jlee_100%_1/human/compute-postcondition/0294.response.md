Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 1, n is greater than 1. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. Otherwise, count2 is 0, count is 1, and done is False. If count2 is not equal to count, then if count2 is greater than count, done is True. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values.**
