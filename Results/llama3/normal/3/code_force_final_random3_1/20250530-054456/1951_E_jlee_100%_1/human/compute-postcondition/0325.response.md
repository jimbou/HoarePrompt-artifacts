Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2. If count is greater than 1, then done is True, count is 2, count2 is 0, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first j-1 characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string is printed. Otherwise, done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 0.**
