Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2, done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `count2` to 0 and then encounters a `continue` statement. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no loops in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the program's execution. Therefore, the only change made by the code is setting `count2` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
