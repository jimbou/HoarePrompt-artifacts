The code prints the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) which is stored in the variable `string`. This string is the same as the string that was used to create the list `s` of characters.
Output: **string (where string is the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) that was used to create the list s of characters)**
