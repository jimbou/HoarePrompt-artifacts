Functionality: **This function reads a series of strings from standard input, where the first line contains the number of strings (t) and each subsequent line contains a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first substring is a palindrome and the second substring is not equal to the first character of the original string. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES', the number of splits (1 or 2), and the resulting substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all input strings and prints the results for each string.**
