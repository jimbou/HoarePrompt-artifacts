Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). The sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, the current value of n is 1, and done is False.**
