Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). The sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, the current value of n is 1, and done is False, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program flow is altered to skip the rest of the current iteration.
