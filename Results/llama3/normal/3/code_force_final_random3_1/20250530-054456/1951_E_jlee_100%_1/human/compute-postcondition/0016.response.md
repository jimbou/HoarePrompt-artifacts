Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters in the string, `x` is the first character of the string, and the current value of `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, and 'YES' is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and the string is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 strings. The printing of 'YES', 1, and the string also remains unchanged.
