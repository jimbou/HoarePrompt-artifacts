Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 3, j is 3. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 3 and done is True. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If count2 is less than count, then done is True. If count2 is greater than or equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. If count is less than or equal to 1, then if s[j] is not equal to x, count is 3 and done is True, otherwise count and done remain unchanged.***
