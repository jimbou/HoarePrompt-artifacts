Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, n is greater than 3, j is 3. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 3 and done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the number 2 is printed, and this is printed: the substring of string from index 0 to j-2 (which is 2) and the substring of string from index j-1 (which is 2) to the end of the string**
