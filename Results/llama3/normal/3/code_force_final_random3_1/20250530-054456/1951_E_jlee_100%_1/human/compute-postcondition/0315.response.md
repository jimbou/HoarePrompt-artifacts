Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then done is True, count is 2, and count2 is 0. Otherwise, the values of done, count, and count2 remain unchanged. 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and the first two characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string starting from the third character is printed**
