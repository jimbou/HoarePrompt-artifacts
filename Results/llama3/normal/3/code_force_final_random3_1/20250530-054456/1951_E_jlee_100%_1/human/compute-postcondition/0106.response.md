The code prints the string sliced into two parts: the first part from the beginning of the string to the index `j` (exclusive), and the second part from the index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `j` is 1, the first part of the string will be the first character of the string, which is `x`. The second part of the string will be the rest of the string, excluding the first character.

Output: **x (the first character of the string), (the rest of the string excluding the first character)**
