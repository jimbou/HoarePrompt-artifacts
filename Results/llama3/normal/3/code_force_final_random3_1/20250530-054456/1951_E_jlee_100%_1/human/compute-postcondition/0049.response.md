Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, count is 0, count2 is 0, n is at least 1, j is 0. The current value of jth character of the string is not equal to the first character of the string and the current value of count is less than 1. If the jth character of the string is not equal to the (n-1-j)th character of the string, then done is True.**
