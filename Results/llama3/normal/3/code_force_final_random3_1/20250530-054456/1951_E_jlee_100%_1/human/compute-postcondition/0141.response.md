Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters in the string, x is the first character of the string, j is 2, n is greater than 2. If the character at index j in the string is not equal to the character at index n-1-j and count is less than 1, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is set to True, and count is set to 2. Otherwise, done is False.***
