The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is a number that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
