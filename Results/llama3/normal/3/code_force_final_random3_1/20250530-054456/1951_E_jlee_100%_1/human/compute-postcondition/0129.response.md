Postcondition: **The program executes an if-else block that checks the condition `s[j] != x`. If the condition is true, the program checks the values of `count` and `count2`. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count` is greater than 1 and `count2` equals `count`, `done` is set to True, the number 2 is printed, and a specific string is printed. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. If the condition `s[j] != x` is false, `count2` is increased by 1. Additionally, if the character at index `j` in the string is not equal to the character at index `n-1-j` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` remains False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
