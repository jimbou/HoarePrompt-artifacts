Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus n plus 1, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a), data remains unchanged, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the value at `data[idx]`, and `idx` has been incremented by `n + 1` to point to the next position in the `data` sequence. The list `a` now contains `n` integers from the `data` sequence starting at the original `idx` position. The `results` list has been appended with the result of the function `func_1(n, a)`. The other variables, `t`, `_`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
