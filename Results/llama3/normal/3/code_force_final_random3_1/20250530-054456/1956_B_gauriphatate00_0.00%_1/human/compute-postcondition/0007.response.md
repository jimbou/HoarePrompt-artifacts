Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the sum of all n values plus t, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) for each iteration, data remains unchanged, t is 0, _ is t-1, stdin is empty**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of n will be the last value read from the data, idx will have moved forward by the sum of all n values plus t, a will contain the last list of n integers read from the data, results will contain the results of func_1(n, a) for each iteration, data will remain unchanged, t will be 0 (since the loop has finished), _ will be t-1 (since the loop has executed t times), and stdin will still be empty.
