The code prints the first result in the results list, which is the result of the function func_1(n, a), where n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], and a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n].

Output: **the first result of func_1(n, a) (where n is the value at data[idx] and a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n])**
