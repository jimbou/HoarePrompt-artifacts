Output: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[idx]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `n` values plus `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results of `func_1(n, a)`, `result` is the second result in the `results` list, `data` remains unchanged, `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, and the second result of `func_1(n, a)` is being printed**
