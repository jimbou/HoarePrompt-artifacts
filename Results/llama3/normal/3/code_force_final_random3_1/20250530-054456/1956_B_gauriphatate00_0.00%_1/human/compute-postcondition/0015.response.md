The `print(result)` statement will print the third result in the `results` list. Since the exact `results` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third result of `func_1(n, a)`.

Output: **the third result of func_1(n, a) (where n is the value at data[idx] and a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n])**
