Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the sum of all n values plus t, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing all results of func_1(n, a), result is the last result in the results list, data remains unchanged, t is 0, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, and the last result of func_1(n, a) is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over all results in the `results` list, printing each result of `func_1(n, a)` in sequence. The loop has completed its execution, and the last result of `func_1(n, a)` is being printed. The values of `n`, `idx`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `stdin` is still empty.
