The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus n plus 1, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a), data remains unchanged, t is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty**
