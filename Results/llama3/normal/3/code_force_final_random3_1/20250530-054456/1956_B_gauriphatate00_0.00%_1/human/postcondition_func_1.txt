The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It reads a sequence of positive integers and lists of integers, where each list represents a sequence of integers from 1 to n, with each integer appearing at most twice. The function then calls another function, func_1, with each list and its corresponding n, and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list. The function does not modify the input data and leaves the standard input empty after processing.
