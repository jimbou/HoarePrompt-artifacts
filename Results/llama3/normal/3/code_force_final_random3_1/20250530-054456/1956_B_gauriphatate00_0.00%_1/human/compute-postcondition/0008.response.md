To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `result` and the list `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 result, the loop will execute. 

At the start of the loop, we know that `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration. For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least 1 result. 

Also, since `result` is the loop variable, it will take the value of the first result in the `results` list at the start of the loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the sum of all n values plus t, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing at least 1 result of func_1(n, a), result is the first result in the results list, data remains unchanged, t is 0, _ is t-1, stdin is empty**
