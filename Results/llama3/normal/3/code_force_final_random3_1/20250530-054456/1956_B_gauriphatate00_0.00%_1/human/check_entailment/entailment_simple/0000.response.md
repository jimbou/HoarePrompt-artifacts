Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy to maximize the number of points that can be scored by selecting cards optimally. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum value between the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` and half of the positive integer `n`. This is because the optimal strategy is to play the pairs of cards that appear twice in the list, and the maximum number of points that can be scored is half of the total number of cards.

The main function reads the input data, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results. The state of the program before and after each function call is correctly described in the comments.

Correctness: **True**
