Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the new value of n plus 1, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a), data remains unchanged, t is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the value at `data[idx]`. The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1 and then by the new value of `n`, so it is now equal to its original value plus the new value of `n` plus 1. The list `a` now contains `n` integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`. The list `results` has been appended with the result of `func_1(n, a)`, in addition to its original value. The value of `data` remains unchanged, as does the value of `t` and `_`. The stdin remains empty.
