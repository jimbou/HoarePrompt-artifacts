Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game by taking turns optimally. The game involves two players, each with n cards, and the goal is to maximize the score by selecting cards that will result in points.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the minimum value between the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the input list 'a' and half of the input positive integer 'n'. This function is used to determine the maximum number of points a player can score.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It calls `func_1` with each list of integers and its corresponding n, and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list.

The provided execution summaries suggest that both functions work as expected. `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum value, and `func_2` correctly reads input, processes it, and prints the results.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the functions do not fully meet the problem description. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points a player can score by taking turns optimally, but the functions only calculate the minimum value between the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the input list 'a' and half of the input positive integer 'n'. This calculation does not take into account the optimal strategy for the player to maximize their score.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
