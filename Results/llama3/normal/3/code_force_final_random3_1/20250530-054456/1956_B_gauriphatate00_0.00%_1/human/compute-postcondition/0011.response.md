To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 results, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 result, and `result` is the first result in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 2 results, and `result` must be the second result in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[idx]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `n` values plus `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results of `func_1(n, a)`, `result` is the second result in the `results` list, `data` remains unchanged, `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty**
