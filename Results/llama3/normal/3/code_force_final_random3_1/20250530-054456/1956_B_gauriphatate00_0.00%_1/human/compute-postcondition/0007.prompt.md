Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i and each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a at most 2 times, t is an integer equal to the first value in the input data, idx is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus n plus 1, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a), data remains unchanged, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the new value of n plus 1, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a), data remains unchanged, t is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the new value of n plus 1 plus n, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a), data remains unchanged, t is greater than 1, _ is 2, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
