The only variable in the loop head is variable `result`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`. If the `results` has at least 3 results the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the `results` list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `results` must have at least 3 results and the `result` is the third result in the `results` list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the value at `data[idx]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `n` values plus `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `results` is a list containing at least 3 results of `func_1(n, a)`, `result` is the third result in the `results` list, `data` remains unchanged, `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty**
