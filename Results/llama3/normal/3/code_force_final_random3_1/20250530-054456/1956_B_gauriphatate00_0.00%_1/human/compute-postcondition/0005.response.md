To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], `idx` is equal to its original value plus the new value of `n` plus 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers from data[idx:idx + n], `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a), `data` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty**
