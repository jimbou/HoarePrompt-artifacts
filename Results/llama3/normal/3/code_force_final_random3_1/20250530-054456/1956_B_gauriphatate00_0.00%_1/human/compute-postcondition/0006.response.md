Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the new value of n plus 1 plus n, a is a list of n integers from data[idx:idx + n], results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a), data remains unchanged, t is greater than 1, _ is 2, stdin is empty**

The code block updates the values of `n`, `idx`, `a`, and `results`. The value of `n` is updated to the value at `data[idx]`, which is a positive integer. The value of `idx` is incremented by 1 and then by the new value of `n`, so it becomes equal to its original value plus the new value of `n` plus 1 plus `n`. The value of `a` is updated to a list of `n` integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`. The `results` list is appended with the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, which is added to the existing results. The values of `data`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `stdin` remains empty.
