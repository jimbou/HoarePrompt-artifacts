Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for all `j` in the range of `adv`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and `j` is `adv - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` will contain all the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for all `j` in the range of `adv`, which is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.
