The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of array `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is equal to the length of array `a`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, so `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Also, since `n` is equal to the length of array `a`, the length of array `a` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value plus 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is decremented by `adv`, `cur` is decremented by `adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `a[i]`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by `counter[a[i]]`**
