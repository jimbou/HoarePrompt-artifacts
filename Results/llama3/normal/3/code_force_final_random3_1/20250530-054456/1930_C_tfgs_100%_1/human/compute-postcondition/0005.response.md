The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case and is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where `a[0]` is incremented by 1 and `a[1]` is incremented by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2**
