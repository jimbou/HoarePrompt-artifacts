Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value plus 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `cur` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `a[i]`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - j - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by `counter[a[i]]`, `adv` is at least `n - 2`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following changes:

*   The variable `j` has reached its final value of `n - 2`, indicating that the loop has executed `n - 2` times.
*   The list `ans` has been populated with the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `a[i]`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - j - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, reflecting the cumulative effect of the loop iterations.
*   The variable `adv` has been updated to be at least `n - 2`, indicating that the loop has executed at least `n - 2` times.

All other variables, such as `n`, `a`, `i`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `counter[a[i]]`, retain their values from the initial state, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
