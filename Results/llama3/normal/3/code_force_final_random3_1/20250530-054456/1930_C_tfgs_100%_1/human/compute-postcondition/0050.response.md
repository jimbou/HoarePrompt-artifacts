Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is at least 2, `ans` is a list containing all the values from the original list `a` in ascending order except the last two elements where the second last element is decreased by 1 and the last element is decreased by 1 from the second last element, and `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending a new element which is one less than the last element of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
