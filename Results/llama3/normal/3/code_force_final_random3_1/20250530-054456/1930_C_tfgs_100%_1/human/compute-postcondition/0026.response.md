The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `adv` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `adv` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `adv` must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `cnt` and `cur` are not modified, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 1**
