To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` (a throwaway variable that doesn't affect the loop's execution) and `cnt`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, we have the following states:

* `n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`
* `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`
* `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`
* `cur` is 0
* `cnt` is 0
* `ans` is a list containing all the values from the original list `a` in ascending order
* `i` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `cnt` to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be at least 1, `ans` is a list containing all the values from the original list `a` in ascending order, and `i` is 0**
