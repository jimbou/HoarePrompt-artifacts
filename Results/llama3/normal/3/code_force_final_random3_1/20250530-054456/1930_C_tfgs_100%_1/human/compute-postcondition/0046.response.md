Output State: **n is an integer equal to the length of array a, a is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case where each element a[i] is incremented by i + 1, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list a, cur is 0, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all the values from the original list a in ascending order, and i is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` contains all the values from the original list `a` in ascending order, and the variables `cur`, `cnt`, and `i` are reset to their initial values. The variables `n` and `counter` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
