Output State: `n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the value of `cnt` in the initial state, `ans` is a list containing all the values from the original list `a` in ascending order except the last `cnt` elements where each element is decreased by 1 from the previous element, and `i` is 0.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` will contain all the elements from the original list `a` in ascending order, except for the last `cnt` elements, which will be decreased by 1 from the previous element. The other variables remain unchanged.
