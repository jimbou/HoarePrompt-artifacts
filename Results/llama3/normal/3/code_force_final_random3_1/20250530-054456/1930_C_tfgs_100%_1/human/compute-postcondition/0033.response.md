Output State: **n is an integer equal to the length of array a, a is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case where each element a[i] is incremented by i + 1 and must have at least 2 elements, i is incremented by 1 from its previous value, j is n - 2, cnt is decremented by adv, cur is decremented by adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - (n - 1), a[i], counter[a[i]] is decremented by 1, cur is incremented by counter[a[i]].**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The list `ans` is extended by appending the value of `a[i]`.
*   The value of `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.
*   The value of `cur` is incremented by the value of `counter[a[i]]`.
