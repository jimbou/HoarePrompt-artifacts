The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer equal to the length of array a in the current test case and a is a list of integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array a in the current test case and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**
