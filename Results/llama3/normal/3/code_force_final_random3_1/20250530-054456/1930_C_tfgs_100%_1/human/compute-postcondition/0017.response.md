Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans` now contains an additional element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1` where `j` is 2 and `i` is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
