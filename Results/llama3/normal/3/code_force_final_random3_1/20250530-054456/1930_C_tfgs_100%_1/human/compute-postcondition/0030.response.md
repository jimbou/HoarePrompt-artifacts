Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `adv` must be at least `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cnt` and `cur` are not modified, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated `n - 1` times, where `n` is the length of the array `a`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and the variable `j` has reached its maximum value of `n - 2`. The variables `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains `n - 1` elements, each of which is a value from the array `a` decremented by a value ranging from 1 to `n - 1`.
