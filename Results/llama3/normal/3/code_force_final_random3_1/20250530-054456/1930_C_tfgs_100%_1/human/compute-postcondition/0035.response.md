Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value plus 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `cur` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `a[i]`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by `counter[a[i]]`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `counter[a[i]]` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is decremented by the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. The value of `cur` is also decremented by the same amount. The value of `adv` is set to this minimum value.
