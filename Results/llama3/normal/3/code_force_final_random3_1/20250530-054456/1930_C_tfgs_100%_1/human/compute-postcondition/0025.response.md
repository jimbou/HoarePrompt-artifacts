Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `adv` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `cnt` and `cur` are not modified, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of array `a` is still `n`, and `a` is still a sorted list of unique integers with each element incremented by its 1-based index. The value of `i` is still incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `adv` is still at least 1. The value of `j` is still 0. The values of `cnt` and `cur` are still unchanged. The list `ans` now contains a new element which is the value of `a[i - 1]` minus 1.
