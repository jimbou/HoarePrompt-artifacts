Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case and is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where `a[0]` is incremented by 1 and `a[1]` is incremented by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a[1]` has been incremented by 2 because `i` is 1 and `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of array `a` is still `n`, which is greater than 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `i` is still 1.
