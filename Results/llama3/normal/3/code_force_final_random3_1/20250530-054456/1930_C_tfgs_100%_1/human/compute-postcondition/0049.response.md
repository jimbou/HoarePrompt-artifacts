The only variable in the loop head is variable `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. If `cnt` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is at least 2, `ans` is a list containing all the values from the original list `a` in ascending order except the last element which is decreased by 1, and `i` is 0**
