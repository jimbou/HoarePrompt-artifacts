Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`**

In this output state, the value of `adv` is calculated based on the values of `a[i - 1]`, `a[i]`, `cnt`, and `cur`. The value of `adv` is the smallest of the three expressions `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the given code.
