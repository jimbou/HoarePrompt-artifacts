Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a list of integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the length of the array `a` remains the same as initially, but each element in the array has been incremented by a value equal to its index plus one. The variable `i` has reached the last index of the array, and the stdin remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
