The value of `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, where `i` is 0. So, `a[0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `a[0]` is now `a[0] + 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where `a[0]` is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**
