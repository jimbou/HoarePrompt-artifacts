The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and adv, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `adv` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `adv` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
