To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 1`, which means `n` is at least 1. So, we need to adjust the state of `a` to have at least 1 element.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
