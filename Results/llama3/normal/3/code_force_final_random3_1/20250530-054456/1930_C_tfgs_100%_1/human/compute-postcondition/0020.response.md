Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the length of array a in the current test case, a is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case where each element a[i] is incremented by i + 1 and must have at least 1 element, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list a, if i is greater than 0, then cur is 0 - adv, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a minus adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 for all j in the range of adv, and adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur. Otherwise, the values of cur, cnt, and ans remain unchanged.***
