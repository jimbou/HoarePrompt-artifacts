Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 3 elements. If `i` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value plus 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) + adv`, `cur` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) + adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `a[i]`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - j - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, and `cur` is incremented by `counter[a[i]]`. If `i` is not greater than 0, the values of `n`, `a`, `i`, `j`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`, and `counter[a[i]]` remain unchanged.***
