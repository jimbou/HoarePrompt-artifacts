Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        cur -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1
    cur += counter[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer equal to the length of array a in the current test case, a is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case where each element a[i] is incremented by i + 1 and must have at least 1 element, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list a, if i is greater than 0, then cur is the sum of the original value of cur and the frequency of a[i] in the original list a, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a minus adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 for all j in the range of adv and a[i], and adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur. Otherwise, the values of cur, cnt, and ans remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the length of array a, a is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case where each element a[i] is incremented by i + 1 and must have at least 2 elements, i is incremented by 1 from its previous value, j is n - 2, cnt is decremented by adv, cur is decremented by adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - (n - 1), a[i], counter[a[i]] is decremented by 1, cur is incremented by counter[a[i]].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the length of array a, a is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case where each element a[i] is incremented by i + 1 and must have at least 3 elements, i is greater than 0, j is n - 2, cnt is decremented by min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) + adv, cur is decremented by min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) + adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - (n - 1), a[i], a[i - 1] - j - 1, a[i - 1] - j - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - (n - 1), a[i], counter[a[i]] is decremented by 1, and cur is incremented by counter[a[i]].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
