Output State: **n is an integer equal to the length of array a, a is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case where each element a[i] is incremented by i + 1 and must have at least 3 elements, i is greater than 0, j is n - 2, cnt is decremented by min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) + adv, cur is decremented by min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) + adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - (n - 1), a[i], a[i - 1] - j - 1, a[i - 1] - j - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - (n - 1), a[i], counter[a[i]] is decremented by 1, and cur is incremented by counter[a[i]].**

The final state of the program is as follows: `n` remains unchanged as an integer equal to the length of array `a`. The array `a` remains a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 3 elements. The value of `i` is greater than 0. The value of `j` is `n - 2`. The value of `cnt` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) + adv`. The value of `cur` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) + adv`. The list `ans` contains the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `a[i]`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - j - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `a[i]`. The value of `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. The value of `cur` is incremented by `counter[a[i]]`.
