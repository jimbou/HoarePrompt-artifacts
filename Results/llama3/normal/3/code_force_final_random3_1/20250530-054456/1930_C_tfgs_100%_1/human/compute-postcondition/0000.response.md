Output State: **n is an integer equal to the length of array a in the current test case, a is a list of integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads the length of array a from stdin and assigns it to n. Then, it reads the elements of array a from stdin and assigns them to a. The value of n is now equal to the length of array a in the current test case, and the value of a is now a list of integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case. Stdin now contains one less test case.
