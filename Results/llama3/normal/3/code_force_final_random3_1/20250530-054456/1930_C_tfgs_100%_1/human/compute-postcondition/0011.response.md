Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than 0, and `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of array `a` is still `n`, and `a` remains a sorted list of unique integers with each element incremented by its 1-based index. The frequency of each element in the original list `a` is still stored in the `counter` dictionary. The value of `cur` is still 0, and `cnt` still represents the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`. The list `ans` is still empty. The current value of `i` is still greater than 0, indicating that this is not the first test case. Additionally, a new variable `adv` has been introduced, which is the minimum of the difference between the current element and the previous element in `a` minus 1, the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, and the value of `cur`.
