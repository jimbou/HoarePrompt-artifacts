To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `adv`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `adv`. If `adv` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. However, these conditions do not guarantee that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust the state of `adv` to be at least 1 and `j` is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `adv` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `cnt` and `cur` are not modified**
