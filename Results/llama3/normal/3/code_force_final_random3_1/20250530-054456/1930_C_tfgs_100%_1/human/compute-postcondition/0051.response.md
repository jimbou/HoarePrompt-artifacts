The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `cnt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. If `cnt` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `cnt` is at least 3 and `_` is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is at least 3, `ans` is a list containing all the values from the original list `a` in ascending order except the last two elements where the second last element is decreased by 1 and the last element is decreased by 1 from the second last element, and `i` is 0, `_` is 1**
