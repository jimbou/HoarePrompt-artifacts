State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `adv` must be at least 3, `j` is 2, `cnt` and `cur` are not modified, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1` which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 2` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 3`**
