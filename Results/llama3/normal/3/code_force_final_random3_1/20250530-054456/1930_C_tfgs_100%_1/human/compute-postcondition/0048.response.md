Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be at least 1, `ans` is a list containing all the values from the original list `a` in ascending order except the last element which is decreased by 1, and `i` is 0**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated by appending a new element which is the last element of `ans` decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
