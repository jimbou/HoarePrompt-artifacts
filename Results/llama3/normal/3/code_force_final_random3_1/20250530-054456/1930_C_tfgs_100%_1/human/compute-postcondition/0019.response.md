Output State: **n is an integer equal to the length of array a in the current test case, a is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array a in the current test case where each element a[i] is incremented by i + 1 and must have at least 1 element, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list a, cur is 0 - adv, cnt is the number of duplicate elements in the original list a minus adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 for all j in the range of adv, i is greater than 0, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and j is adv - 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that modify the values of `cnt` and `cur`. The first line decrements `cnt` by the value of `adv`, and the second line decrements `cur` by the value of `adv`. Since `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, it is used to update both `cnt` and `cur`. The values of `n`, `a`, `counter`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
