Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains two values: the original value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and the newly appended value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
