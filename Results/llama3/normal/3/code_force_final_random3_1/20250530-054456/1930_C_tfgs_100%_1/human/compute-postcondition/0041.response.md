Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value plus 1, `j` is 3, `cnt` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `cur` is decremented by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (n - 1)`, `a[i]`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - j - 2`, `a[i - 1] - j - 3`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by `counter[a[i]]`, `adv` is at least 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of array `a` is still `n`, and `a` is still a sorted list of unique integers with each element incremented by its index plus one, and it has at least 3 elements. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value plus 1. The value of `j` is still 3. The value of `cnt` is decremented by the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. The value of `cur` is also decremented by the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. The list `ans` now contains the additional value `a[i - 1] - j - 3`. The value of `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, and `cur` is incremented by the value of `counter[a[i]]`. The value of `adv` is still at least 3.
