Output State: **n is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is transformed into a sorted list of unique integers, with each element being the original element incremented by its index plus one. The `counter` dictionary is created to store the frequency of each element in the original list `a`. The variable `cur` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` is calculated as the difference between the original length of `a` and the length of the new sorted list, representing the number of duplicate elements in the original list. The list `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n - 1`. The state of stdin is also updated to reflect that one test case has been processed.
