To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a` (through its length, which is tied to `n`).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and assuming the loop body does not modify `n` or `i` directly (as per the task's constraints), we can infer the following adjustments:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same since it's determined by the length of `a`, which isn't directly modified by the loop head.

However, since the task does not explicitly state the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only express the adjustment in terms of the increment. But, given that `a` must have at least 1 element and assuming the loop iterates over all elements in `a`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `a`, which is `n`.

Thus, the adjusted state, focusing only on the variables directly involved in the loop head (`i` and implicitly `n` through its relation to `a`), would be:

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Note: The description of `a` having "at least 2 elements" is an inference based on the requirement for the loop to execute one more time, implying that `i` must be able to increment and still be within the bounds of `a`. The original state description of `a` having "at least 1 element" is updated to reflect this necessity for the loop to continue.
