To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `adv`. If `adv` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, we need to ensure that at least one of these values is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1` and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` must be greater than 0, and `j` is 0**
