Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case and is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers containing the elements of array `a` in the current test case where `a[0]` is incremented by 1, `a[1]` is incremented by 2 and `a[2]` is incremented by 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `a[2]` has been updated by incrementing it by 4, as per the given code `a[i] += i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still equal to the length of array `a` in the current test case and is greater than 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `i` is still 2.
