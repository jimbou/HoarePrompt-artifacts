Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, i is 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, a is a binary string of the same length as n, count is the number of '1' bits in a, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the count of '1' bits in a is 2 and the second '1' bit is not immediately after the first '1' bit, 'YES' is printed. If the count of '1' bits in a is not 2 or the second '1' bit is immediately after the first '1' bit, 'NO' is printed.**
