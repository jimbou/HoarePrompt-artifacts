The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, `a` is a binary string of the same length as `n`, `count` is the number of '1' bits in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1. If `count` is 0, 'YES' is printed. If `count` is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If `count` is 2 and the binary string `a` has a '1' bit followed by a '0' bit, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
