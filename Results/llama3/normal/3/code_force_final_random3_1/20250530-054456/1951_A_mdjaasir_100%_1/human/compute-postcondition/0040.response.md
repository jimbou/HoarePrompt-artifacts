Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, i is 1, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, a is a binary string of the same length as n, count is the number of '1' bits in a, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the binary string a has a '1' bit followed by a '0' bit, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
