Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a binary string (a) of the same length as n. It then checks the number of '1' bits in the binary string and prints 'YES' if the count is 0, or if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is 2 and the second '1' bit is not immediately after the first '1' bit. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
