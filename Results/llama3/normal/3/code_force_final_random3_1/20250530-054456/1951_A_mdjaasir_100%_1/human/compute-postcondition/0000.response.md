Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first a binary string of the same length as the integer. The integer is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is a positive integer less than or equal to 50. The stdin now contains one less test case, and each remaining test case still contains two inputs: first an integer and then a binary string of the same length as the integer. The integer is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.
