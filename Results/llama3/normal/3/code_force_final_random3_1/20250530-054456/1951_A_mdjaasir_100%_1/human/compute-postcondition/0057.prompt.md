Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first a binary string of the same length as the integer. The integer is a positive integer less than or equal to 50.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, i is 0, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, a is a binary string of the same length as n, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If there are no '1's in a, 'YES' is printed. If there are '1's in a, 'YES' is printed if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and is an even number, or if the count is equal to 2 and the character immediately after the first '1' in a is not '1'. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, i is 1, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, a is a binary string of the same length as n, count is the number of '1' bits in a, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the binary string a has a '1' bit followed by a '0' bit, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, i is 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, a is a binary string of the same length as n, count is the number of '1' bits in a, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the second '1' bit is not immediately after the first '1' bit, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
