Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, i is 0, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, a is a binary string of the same length as n, count is the number of '1's in a and is larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If count is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If count is equal to 2, 'YES' is printed if the character immediately after the first '1' in a is not '1', otherwise 'NO' is printed. If count is not equal to 2 and not greater than 2 and even, 'NO' is printed.***
