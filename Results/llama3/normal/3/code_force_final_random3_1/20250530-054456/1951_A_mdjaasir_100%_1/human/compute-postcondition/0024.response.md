Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, i is 0, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, a is a binary string of the same length as n, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If there are no '1's in a, 'YES' is printed. If there are '1's in a, 'YES' is printed if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and is an even number, or if the count is equal to 2 and the character immediately after the first '1' in a is not '1'. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
