Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a dictionary with two keys u and v, each containing a list with two elements, stdin contains n-3 lines each with two integers u and v, and one integer u_1, i is 1**

The code reads two integers u and v from stdin and appends v to the list of nodes[u] and u to the list of nodes[v]. This operation is performed once, so the lists of nodes[u] and nodes[v] now contain two elements each. The value of n, t, edges, empty, and i remains unchanged. Stdin now contains n-3 lines, each with two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.
