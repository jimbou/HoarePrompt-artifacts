Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a dictionary with `n-1` keys, each containing a list with `n-1` elements, `i` is `n-2`, `stdin` is empty, `ends` is a list containing all keys in the `nodes` dictionary that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element in `ends`, `e` is the second element in `ends`, `tree` is a list containing `s`, the first element in the list `nodes[s]`, and `curr` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`, and `tree` now contains one more element which is `curr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tree` has been updated by appending the value of `curr` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The `tree` list now contains one more element, which is the current value of `curr`. All other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
