Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a dictionary with `n-1` keys, each containing a list with `n-1` elements, `i` is `n-2`, stdin contains one integer `u_1`, `ends` is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary that have a list of length 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, and `i` as in the initial state. The only change will be in the `ends` list, which will contain all keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a list of length 1.
