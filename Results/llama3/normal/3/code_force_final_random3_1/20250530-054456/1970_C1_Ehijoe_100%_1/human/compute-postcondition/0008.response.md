Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a dictionary with `n-1` keys, each containing a list with `n-1` elements, `ends` is an empty list, `i` is `n-2`, stdin contains one integer `u_1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ends` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one integer `u_1`.
