The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a dictionary with two keys u and v, each containing a list with two elements, stdin contains n-3 lines each with two integers u and v, and one integer u_1, i is 2**
