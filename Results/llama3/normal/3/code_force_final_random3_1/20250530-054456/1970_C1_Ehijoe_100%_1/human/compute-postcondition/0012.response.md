Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a dictionary with at least 1 key, each containing a list with `n-1` elements, `i` is `n-2`, stdin contains one integer `u_1`, if the length of the list of the first key in the nodes dictionary is 1, then `ends` is a list containing the first key in the nodes dictionary. Otherwise, `ends` is an empty list.***
