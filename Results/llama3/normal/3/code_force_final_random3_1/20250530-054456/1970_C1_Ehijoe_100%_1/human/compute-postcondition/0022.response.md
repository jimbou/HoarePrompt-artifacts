Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a dictionary with `n-1` keys, each containing a list with `n-1` elements, `i` is `n-2`, `stdin` is empty, `ends` is a list containing all keys in the `nodes` dictionary that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element in `ends`, `e` is the second element in `ends`, `tree` is a list containing `s` and the first element in the list `nodes[s]`, `prev` is `s`, `curr` is the first element in the list `nodes[s]` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated to include the first element in the list `nodes[s]`, which is also the value of `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
