Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a dictionary with n-1 keys, each containing a list with n-1 elements, i is n-2, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary that have a list of length 1, s is the first element in ends, e is the second element in ends, tree is a list containing s, prev is s, curr is the first element in the list nodes[s].
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a dictionary with n-1 keys, each containing a list with n-1 elements, i is n-2, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary that have a list of length 1, s is the first element in ends, e is the second element in ends, tree is a list containing s and the first element in the list nodes[s], prev is the first element in the list nodes[s], and curr is the second element in the list nodes[curr] if nodes[curr][0] is not equal to prev. Otherwise, curr is the first element in the list nodes[first element in the list nodes[s]].
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a dictionary with n-1 keys, each containing a list with n-1 elements, i is n-2, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary that have a list of length 1, s is the first element in ends, e is the second element in ends, tree is a list containing s, the first element in the list nodes[s], and curr. If nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, then prev is the second element in the list nodes[curr]. Otherwise, prev is the first element in the list nodes[s] and curr is the second element in the list nodes[curr] if nodes[curr][0] is not equal to prev. Otherwise, curr is the first element in the list nodes[first element in the list nodes[s]] and curr must not be equal to e.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a dictionary with `n-1` keys, each containing a list with `n-1` elements, `i` is `n-2`, `stdin` is empty, `ends` is a list containing all keys in the `nodes` dictionary that have a list of length 1, `s` is the first element in `ends`, `e` is the second element in `ends`, `tree` is a list containing `s`, the first element in the list `nodes[s]`, and either the second element in the list `nodes[curr]` if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, or `nodes[curr][0]` otherwise, and `prev` is either the first element in the list `nodes[curr]` if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, or the second element in the list `nodes[s]` otherwise, and `curr` is either the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` if `nodes[curr][0]` is not equal to `prev`, or the current value of `curr` otherwise.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
