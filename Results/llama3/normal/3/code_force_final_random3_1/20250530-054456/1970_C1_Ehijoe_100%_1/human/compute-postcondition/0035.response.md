Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a dictionary with n-1 keys, each containing a list with n-1 elements, i is n-2, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary that have a list of length 1, s is the first element in ends, e is the second element in ends, tree is a list containing s, the first element in the list nodes[s], and the second element in the list nodes[curr], and prev is the first element in the list nodes[curr].**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `prev` and `curr`. The value of `prev` is now the first element in the list `nodes[curr]`, and the value of `curr` is now the second element in the list `nodes[curr]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
