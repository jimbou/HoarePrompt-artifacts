Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, each containing a list with `n-1` elements, `i` is `n-2`, stdin contains one integer `u_1`, `ends` is a list containing the second key in the nodes dictionary if the length of the list of the second key in the nodes dictionary is 1, otherwise `ends` is a list containing the second key in the nodes dictionary.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is still 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is still a dictionary with at least 2 keys, each containing a list with `n-1` elements, `i` is still `n-2`, stdin still contains one integer `u_1`. The list `ends` now contains the second key in the nodes dictionary.
