To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `na_frente`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `na_frente`. If `na_frente` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Since `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and at least -1, we can adjust its state to be at least 0. Additionally, `v` is the loop variable, so we can adjust its state to be the starting value of the loop, which is `na_frente`.

State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `best` is sys.float_info.max, `total` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
