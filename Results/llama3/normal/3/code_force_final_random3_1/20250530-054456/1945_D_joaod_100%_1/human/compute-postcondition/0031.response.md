Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, `total` is not defined in the initial state so we cannot calculate its value, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `best` is calculated by adding `total` and the last element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a` (since `v` is -1). The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Note that the value of `total` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
