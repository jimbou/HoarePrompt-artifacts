Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200,000). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n separated by spaces (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cases is at least 1, c is 0, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is the sum of the minimum costs of either changing a or passing b at each index from na_frente to -1, best is the minimum total cost plus the cost of changing a at the index that results in the minimum total cost, stdin contains 0 inputs, and best is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. `v` is equal to -1, `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers. `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which is smaller, or increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and the best value is printed which is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is at least 3, c is 2, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, best is the minimum of the total cost plus the cost to change at each position, total is the sum of the minimum cost to change or pass at each position, stdin is empty, and the best is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
