Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is equal to `na_frente` minus 1, `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers. If `best` is greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been increased by the cost to change `a` at position `v`, which is the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
