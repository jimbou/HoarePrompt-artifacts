Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is at least 3, c is 2, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and at least -1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, best is sys.float_info.max, total is 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `stdin` is empty. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`. Additionally, `total` is increased by the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`, otherwise `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is set to the cost to change `a` at position `v` if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, otherwise `total` is set to the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `stdin` is empty. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. In both cases, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
