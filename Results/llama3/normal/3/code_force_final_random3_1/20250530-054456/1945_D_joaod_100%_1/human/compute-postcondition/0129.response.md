Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, and two lists of n integers each. It then calculates the minimum cost to reach a target position by either changing or passing through each position, and prints the minimum cost for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, updating the minimum cost and total cost as it processes each position, and finally prints the minimum cost for each test case.**
