Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is -1. If the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, then `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.***
