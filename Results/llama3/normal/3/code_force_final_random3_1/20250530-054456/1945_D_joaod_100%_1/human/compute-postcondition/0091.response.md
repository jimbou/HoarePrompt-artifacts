Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `best` is `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `total` is 0, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` is still valid.
