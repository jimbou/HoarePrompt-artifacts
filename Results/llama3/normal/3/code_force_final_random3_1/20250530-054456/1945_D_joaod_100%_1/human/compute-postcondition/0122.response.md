Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the first element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `total` is now equal to its original value plus the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.
