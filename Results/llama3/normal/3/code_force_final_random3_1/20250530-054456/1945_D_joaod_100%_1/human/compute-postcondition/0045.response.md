To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `v` and the range defined by `na_frente`, `-1`, and the step `-1`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `na_frente`. If `na_frente` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Since `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, we can infer that the original value of `na_frente` must be at least 2.

Before the loop starts, we know that `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, and `v` is not defined. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `v` to be equal to `na_frente`, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is sys.float_info.max, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers, `best` is printed, `v` is equal to `na_frente`**
