Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` is the maximum possible float value, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
