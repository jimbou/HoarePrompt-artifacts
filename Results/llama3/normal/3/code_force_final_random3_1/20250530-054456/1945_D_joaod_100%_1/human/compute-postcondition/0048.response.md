Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is now equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is less than or equal to the original value of `best` since the current value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The value of `v` is still equal to `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The value of `best` has been printed.
