Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is equal to `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `best` is now equal to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is a more specific value than its original maximum possible float value.
