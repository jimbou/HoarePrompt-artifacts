The only variables in the loop head are variables  v and na_frente, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v`. If `v` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is -1, `na_frente` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `v` must be greater than or equal to 0. So `na_frente` must be at least 1 and `v` is 0.
State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `stdin` is empty.**
