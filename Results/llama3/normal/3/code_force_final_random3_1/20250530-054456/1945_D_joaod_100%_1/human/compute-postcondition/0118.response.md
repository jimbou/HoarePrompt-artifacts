Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, if `best` is greater than the new value of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to this new value.
