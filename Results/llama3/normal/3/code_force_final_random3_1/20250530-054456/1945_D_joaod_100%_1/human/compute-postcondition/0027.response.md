The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. Since `v` is -1, it refers to the last element in the list. The value of `total` is not specified in the initial state, so we can't determine its new value exactly. However, we can express it as the original value of `total` plus the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is -1, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.**
