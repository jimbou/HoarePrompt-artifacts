Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, `best` is either its original value or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the last element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. The value of `best` is either its original value or the new value of `total` plus the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, depending on whether `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
