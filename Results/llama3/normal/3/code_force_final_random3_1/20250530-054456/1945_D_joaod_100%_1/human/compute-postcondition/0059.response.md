Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, `best` is sys.float_info.max, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers, `best` is printed, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The cost to change `a` at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The cost to change `a` at position `v` is still not less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, and `v` is still equal to `na_frente` and greater than `pos_final`.
