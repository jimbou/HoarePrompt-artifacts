Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is at least 2, c is 1, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is sys.float_info.max, stdin contains 2 inputs: two integers, and best is printed
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which is smaller if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, or increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, `best` is printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which is smaller, or increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. `v` is equal to `na_frente` minus 1, `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers. If `best` is greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. `v` is equal to `na_frente` minus 2, `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which is smaller, or increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the cost to pass `b` at position `v`. If `best` is greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
