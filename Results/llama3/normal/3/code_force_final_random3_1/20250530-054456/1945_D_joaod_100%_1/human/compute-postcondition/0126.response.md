The `print(best)` statement will print the minimum of the total cost plus the cost to change at each position.

Here, `best` is described as the minimum of the total cost plus the cost to change at each position. The total cost is the sum of the minimum cost to change or pass at each position. The cost to change at each position is stored in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and the cost to pass at each position is stored in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The minimum cost to change or pass at each position is not explicitly provided, but it can be inferred that it is the smaller of the two costs at each position.

Since the exact values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `best`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum of the total cost plus the cost to change at each position.

Output: **the minimum of the total cost plus the cost to change at each position (where the total cost is the sum of the minimum cost to change or pass at each position, and the cost to change at each position is stored in the list custo_pra_trocar_a)**
