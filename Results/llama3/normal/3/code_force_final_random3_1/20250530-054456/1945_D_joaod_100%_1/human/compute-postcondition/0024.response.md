Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. If `best` is greater than `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the last element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `best` is still valid, but now it is compared to the updated value of `total`.
