Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, since `v` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
