Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, `stdin` is empty. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the first element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, but its value may have changed if `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` is less than the original value of `best`.
