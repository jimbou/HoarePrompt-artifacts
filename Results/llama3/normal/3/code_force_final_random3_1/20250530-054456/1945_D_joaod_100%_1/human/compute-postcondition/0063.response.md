Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which is smaller if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, or increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` is equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is equal to `na_frente` minus 1, `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is at least 2, and the current case is 1. The number of elements in front is an integer that is at least 0 and 2 less than its original value. The final position is an integer that is 2 less than its original value. The lists of costs to change `a` and pass `b` remain unchanged. The total cost is updated based on the cost at position `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b`, depending on whether `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The best cost is updated to be the total cost plus the cost at position `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The value of `v` is one less than the number of elements in front. The best cost has been printed. The standard input still contains two integers.
