State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. `v` is equal to -1, `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers. `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which is smaller, or increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and the best value is printed which is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`**
