Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v`, `best` is sys.float_info.max, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers, `best` is printed, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, then `total` is increased by the cost to change `a` at position `v`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.***
