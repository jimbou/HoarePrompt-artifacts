Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The cost to change `a` at index `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass `b` at index `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost to pass `b` at index `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. The total cost is now the previous total cost plus the cost to pass `b` at index `v`. The relationship between `best` and the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at index `v` remains the same.
