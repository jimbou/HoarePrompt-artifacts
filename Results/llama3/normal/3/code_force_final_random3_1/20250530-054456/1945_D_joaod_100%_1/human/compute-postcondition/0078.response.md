Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. `v` is equal to `na_frente` minus 2, `total` is equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is at least 2, and the counter `c` is 1. The value of `na_frente` is an integer that is at least 0 and is 2 less than its original value. The value of `pos_final` is also an integer that is 2 less than its original value. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. The variable `v` is equal to `na_frente` minus 2. The total cost `total` has been increased by the cost to change `a` at position `v`. The best cost `best` is either the maximum possible float value or the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `v`, depending on which is smaller. The best cost has already been printed. The standard input `stdin` still contains two integers.
