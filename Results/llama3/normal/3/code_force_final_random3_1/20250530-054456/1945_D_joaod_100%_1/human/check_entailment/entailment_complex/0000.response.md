Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data for each test case, including the number of people in the queue (n) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), as well as the two lists of integers representing the costs to change or pass through each position.

2. The program correctly initializes the variables needed to keep track of the minimum cost and total cost.

3. The program correctly iterates through each position in the queue, starting from the end and moving backwards. For each position, it checks if the cost to change at that position is less than the cost to pass through that position, and updates the total cost accordingly.

4. The program correctly keeps track of the minimum cost to reach the target position by either changing or passing through each position.

5. The program correctly prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
