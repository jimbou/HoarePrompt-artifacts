The code prints the value of `best`, which is the minimum total cost plus the cost of changing a at the index that results in the minimum total cost.
`best` is calculated based on the values of `total`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and the index that results in the minimum total cost.
`total` is the sum of the minimum costs of either changing a or passing b at each index from `na_frente` to -1.
`na_frente` is -1, so the range of indices is from -1 to -1, meaning only the index -1 is considered.
`custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers, but their exact values are not provided.
However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated minimum total cost plus the cost of changing a at the index that results in the minimum total cost.
Output: **minimum total cost plus the cost of changing a at the index that results in the minimum total cost (where minimum total cost is the sum of the minimum costs of either changing a or passing b at each index from -1 to -1, and the cost of changing a is an element of the custo_pra_trocar_a list)**
