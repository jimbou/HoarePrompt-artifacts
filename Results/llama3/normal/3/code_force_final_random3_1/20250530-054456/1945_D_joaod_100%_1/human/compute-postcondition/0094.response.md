Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is increased by the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been increased by the cost to change at the current position `v`, which is the value at index `v` of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `best`, `total`, and the cost to change at position `v` is still valid, and the cost to change at position `v` is still less than the cost to pass at position `v`.
