Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` is increased by the last element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`, which is accessed using the index `-1` (since `v` is `-1`). The other variables remain unchanged.
