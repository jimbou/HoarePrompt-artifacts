Output State: **`cases` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200,000). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n separated by spaces (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The value of `cases` is now an integer, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with three lines as described in the initial state.
