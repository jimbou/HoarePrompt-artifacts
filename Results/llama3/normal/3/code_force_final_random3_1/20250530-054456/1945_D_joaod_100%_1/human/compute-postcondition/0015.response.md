Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is the maximum possible float value, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `total` is now greater than its initial value of 0 by the amount of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
