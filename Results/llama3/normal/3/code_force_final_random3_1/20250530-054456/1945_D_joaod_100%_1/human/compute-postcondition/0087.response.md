Output State: **cases is at least 3, c is 2, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and at least -1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, best is sys.float_info.max, total is 0, stdin is empty.**

Explanation:

The first two lines of the code read two integers from stdin and assign them to na_frente and pos_final, respectively. Since stdin initially contains two integers, after these lines are executed, stdin becomes empty.

The next two lines read a list of integers from stdin and assign them to custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b, respectively. However, since stdin is empty after the first two lines, these lines do not modify the values of custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b.

The following two lines decrement na_frente and pos_final by 1. This means that na_frente becomes an integer equal to its original value minus 3, and pos_final becomes an integer equal to its original value minus 3.

The last three lines initialize total to 0, best to sys.float_info.max, and do not modify any other variables.

Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
