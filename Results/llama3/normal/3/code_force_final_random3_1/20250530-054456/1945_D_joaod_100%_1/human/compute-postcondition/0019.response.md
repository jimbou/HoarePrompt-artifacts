Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is equal to `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the cost of either changing `a` or passing `b` at index `v`, and if `best` is greater than the updated `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
