Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is -1, `best` is `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`**

In this output state, the value of `best` is calculated by adding `total` to the last element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, since `v` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
