Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `best` is sys.float_info.max, `total` is 0, `stdin` is empty, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to change `a` at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`***
