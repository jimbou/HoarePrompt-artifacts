Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. `v` is equal to `na_frente` minus 2, `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which is smaller, or increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`. If `best` is greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.***
