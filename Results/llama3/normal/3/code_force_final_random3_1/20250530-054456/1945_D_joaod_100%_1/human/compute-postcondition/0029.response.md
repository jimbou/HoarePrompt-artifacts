Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is -1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. If `best` is greater than `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.***
