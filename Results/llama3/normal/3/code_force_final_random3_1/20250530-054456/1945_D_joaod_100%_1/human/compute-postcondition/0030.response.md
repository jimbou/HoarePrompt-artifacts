The only variable in the loop head is variable `v`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v`. If `v` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `v` must be greater than or equal to 0. So `v` is decreased by 1 and is -1. Since `na_frente` is greater than 0, `na_frente` is decreased by 1 and is greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is -1**
