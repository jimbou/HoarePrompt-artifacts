Output State: **cases is at least 2, c is 1, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is sys.float_info.max, stdin contains 2 inputs: two integers, and best is printed**

The code snippet provided modifies the initial state in several ways. The first two lines read two integers from stdin and assign them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`, respectively. The next two lines read two lists of integers from stdin and assign them to `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, respectively. The following two lines decrement `na_frente` and `pos_final` by 1. The last two lines initialize `total` to 0 and `best` to `sys.float_info.max`. 

Note that the value of `best` is printed, but this does not affect the state of the program. Also, the value of `cases` is not modified by the code, so it remains at least 2. The value of `c` is also not modified, so it remains 1. The stdin is now empty, so we don't include it in the output state.
