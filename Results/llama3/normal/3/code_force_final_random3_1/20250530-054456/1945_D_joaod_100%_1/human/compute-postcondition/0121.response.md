Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `v` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `total` is increased by the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The stdin remains empty.
