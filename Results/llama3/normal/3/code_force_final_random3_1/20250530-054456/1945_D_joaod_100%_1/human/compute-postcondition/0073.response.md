Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is either equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which is smaller, or increased by the cost to either change `a` or pass `b` at position `v` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`. `best` is equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is equal to `na_frente` minus 2, `best` has been printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `best` is no longer `sys.float_info.max` because it has been updated to a specific value.
