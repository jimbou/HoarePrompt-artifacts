Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`.***
