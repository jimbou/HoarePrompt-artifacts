Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `stdin` is empty. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`. Additionally, `total` is increased by the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`, otherwise `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is set to the cost to change `a` at position `v` if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, otherwise `total` is set to the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.***
