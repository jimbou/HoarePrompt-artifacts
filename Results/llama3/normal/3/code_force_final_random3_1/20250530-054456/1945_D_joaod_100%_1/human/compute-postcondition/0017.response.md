The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Since `total` was initially 0, its new value will be equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is the maximum possible float value, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
