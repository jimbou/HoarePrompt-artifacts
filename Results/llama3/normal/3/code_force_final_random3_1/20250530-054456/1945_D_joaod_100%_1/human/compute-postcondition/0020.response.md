To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`, which means that `v` will take on the values from `na_frente` down to 0, decrementing by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `v` must be decremented by 1, which means it will become -1. However, since the loop range is defined as `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`, the loop will only execute again if `na_frente` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `v` and `na_frente`. The other variables are not affected by the loop head.

State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is -1**
