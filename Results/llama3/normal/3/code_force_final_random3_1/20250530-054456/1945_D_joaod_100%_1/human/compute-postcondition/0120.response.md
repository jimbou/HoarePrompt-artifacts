Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. In both cases, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.***
