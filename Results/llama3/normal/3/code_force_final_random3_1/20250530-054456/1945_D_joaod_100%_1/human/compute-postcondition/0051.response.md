Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is equal to its original value plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` was greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is printed, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: two integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been updated by adding the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is still either the maximum float value or the updated `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, depending on whether `best` was greater than the updated `total` plus the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The value of `v` is still equal to `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The value of `best` has been printed. The stdin still contains two integer inputs.
