The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` adds the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a` to the variable `total`. Since `v` is -1, it refers to the last element in the list. The value of `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a**, `stdin` is empty.
