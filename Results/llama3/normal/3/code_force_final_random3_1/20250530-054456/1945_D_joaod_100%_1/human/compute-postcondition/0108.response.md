Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, `stdin` is empty. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been increased by the last element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, and if it was true before, `best` will be updated to the new value of `total` plus the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
