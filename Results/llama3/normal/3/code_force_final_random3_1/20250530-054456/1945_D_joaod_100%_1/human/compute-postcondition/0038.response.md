Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.***
