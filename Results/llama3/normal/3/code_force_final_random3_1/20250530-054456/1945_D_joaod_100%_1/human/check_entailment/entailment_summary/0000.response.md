Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a target position in the queue. The program iterates through each position in the queue, updating the minimum cost and total cost as it processes each position. It also correctly handles the case where the cost to change positions is less than the cost to pass through a position. The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected output.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the program's logic is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
