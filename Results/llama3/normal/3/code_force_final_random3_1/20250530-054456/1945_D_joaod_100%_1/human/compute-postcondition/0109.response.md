Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, `stdin` is empty. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is at least 3, the value of c is 2, the number of elements in front is at least 0, the final position is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, the cost to change a is a list of integers, the cost to pass b is a list of integers, the value of v is -1, the total is increased by the last element of the cost to pass b, and the standard input is empty. Additionally, if the best value is greater than the total plus the last element of the cost to change a, then the best value is updated to the total plus the last element of the cost to change a.
