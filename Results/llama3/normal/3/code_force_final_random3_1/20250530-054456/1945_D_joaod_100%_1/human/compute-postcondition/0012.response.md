Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the cost of either changing `a` or passing `b` at index `v`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than the updated `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The cost to change `a` at index `v` is either less than the cost to pass `b` at index `v`, in which case `total` is increased by the cost to change `a`, or the cost to change `a` at index `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass `b` at index `v`, in which case `total` is increased by the cost to pass `b`.***
