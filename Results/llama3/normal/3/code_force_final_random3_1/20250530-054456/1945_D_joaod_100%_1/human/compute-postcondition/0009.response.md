Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is equal to its original value plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than the original value of `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the original value of `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The current value of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the current value of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost of switching at the current position `v` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still dependent on the original value of `total` and the cost of switching at the current position `v`. The relationship between the costs of switching and passing at the current position `v` remains the same.
