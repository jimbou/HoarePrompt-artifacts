Output State: **`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `best` is sys.float_info.max, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `v` and `pos_final` is still valid, and the relationship between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is also still valid.
