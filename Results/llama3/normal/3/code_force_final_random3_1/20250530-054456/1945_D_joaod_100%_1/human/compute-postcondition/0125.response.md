Output State: **cases is at least 3, c is 2, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, best is the minimum of the total cost plus the cost to change at each position, total is the sum of the minimum cost to change or pass at each position, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The variable `v` is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `best` is updated to the minimum of the total cost plus the cost to change at each position, which means it stores the minimum cost to change at any position. The variable `total` is the sum of the minimum cost to change or pass at each position, which means it stores the total cost of the optimal solution.
