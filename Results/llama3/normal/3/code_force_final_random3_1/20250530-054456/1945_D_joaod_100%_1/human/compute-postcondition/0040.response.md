Output State: **cases is at least 1, c is 0, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is the sum of the minimum costs of either changing a or passing b at each index from na_frente to -1, best is the minimum total cost plus the cost of changing a at the index that results in the minimum total cost, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over all indices from na_frente to -1, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The total cost is the sum of the minimum costs of either changing a or passing b at each index, and the best cost is the minimum total cost plus the cost of changing a at the index that results in the minimum total cost. The other variables remain unchanged.
