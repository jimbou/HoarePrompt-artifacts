Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 3, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.***
