Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line**.

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated to the values obtained from the second line of the stdin, which are integers between 1 and 100, 1 and 10^9, and 1 and 10^9, respectively. The stdin now contains at least one line, as the second line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
