Output State: **`k`, `x`, `a` are integers, and stdin contains at least one line. If `x` is less than `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is equal to `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 2, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k-1`, then `z` is calculated by repeating the expression `k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1` `x - k + 3` times, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the program will have processed all the input lines from stdin, and for each line, it will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will have been updated according to the input values, and the program will have terminated.
