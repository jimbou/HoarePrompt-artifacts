Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is an integer between -1 and 99 + (z // (k - 1) + 1), `x - k + 3` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one line**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The range of `z` has been updated to reflect the new possible values after the addition. The rest of the conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
