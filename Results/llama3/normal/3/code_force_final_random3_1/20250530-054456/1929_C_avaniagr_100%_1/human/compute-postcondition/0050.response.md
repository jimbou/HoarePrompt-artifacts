Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is an integer between -1 and 98, stdin contains at least one line**

In this output state, the value of `z` is calculated by subtracting 2 from `k`, which is an integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, `z` can take any integer value between -1 (when `k` is 1) and 98 (when `k` is 100). The values of `x` and `a` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least one line.
