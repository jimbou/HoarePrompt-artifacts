Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line**.

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated based on the input from the second line of stdin, which contains three integers separated by spaces. The value of `s` is no longer relevant as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`. The stdin still contains at least one line, which is the third line and onwards.
