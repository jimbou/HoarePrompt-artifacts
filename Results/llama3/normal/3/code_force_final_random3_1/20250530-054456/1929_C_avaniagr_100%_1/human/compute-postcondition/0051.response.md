To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `x - k + 3` is greater than 0. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, we can adjust their states to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is an integer between -1 and 98, stdin contains at least one line, `x - k + 3` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
