Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `z` is equal to `k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (previous value of z) // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x - k + 3` times, stdin contains at least one line, `i` is `x - k + 2`. The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.***
