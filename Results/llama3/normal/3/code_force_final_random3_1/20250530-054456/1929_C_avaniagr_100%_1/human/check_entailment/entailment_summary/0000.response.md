Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having at least 'n' coins based on the values of 'k', 'x', and 'a'. The program correctly handles different cases based on the relationship between 'x' and 'k-1', and it accurately calculates the minimum amount 'a' needed to guarantee the desired outcome. The execution summary also confirms that the program processes multiple test cases from standard input and prints the correct output based on the given conditions.


Correctness: **True**
