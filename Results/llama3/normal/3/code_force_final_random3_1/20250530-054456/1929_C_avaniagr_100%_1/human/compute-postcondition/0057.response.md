Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is an integer between -1 and 99 + (x - k + 3 - 1) * (z // (k - 1) + 1), `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`, stdin contains at least one line**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `k` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
*   The value of `x` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9.
*   The value of `a` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9.
*   The value of `z` is an integer between -1 and 99 plus the sum of `(z // (k - 1) + 1)` for `(x - k + 3 - 1)` times.
*   The value of `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0.
*   The value of `i` is `x - k + 2`.
*   The stdin contains at least one line.
