Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `z` is equal to `k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1`, stdin contains at least one line, `x - k + 3` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to `k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1`, which is the result of the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions `x - k + 3` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 are still valid.
