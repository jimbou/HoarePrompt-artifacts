Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is an integer between -1 and 99 + (z // (k - 1) + 1) + (z // (k - 1) + 1), `x - k + 3` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least one line**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, `x - k + 3`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one line.
