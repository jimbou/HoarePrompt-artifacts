Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is greater than `k - 2`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line, `z` is an integer between 1 and 29, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself. Since `z` was initially between 0 and 28, and `k` is between 2 and 30, the value of `z // (k - 1)` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, the new value of `z` is between 1 and 29. The other variables remain unchanged.
