Postcondition: ***`k`, `x`, `a` are integers, and stdin contains at least one line. If `x` is less than `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is equal to `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 2, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k-1`, then `z` is calculated by repeating the expression `k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1` `x - k + 3` times, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
