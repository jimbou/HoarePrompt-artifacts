Output State: `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line, `z` is an integer between 0 and 28, `i` is `x - k + 2`, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the exception that `i` is now equal to `x - k + 2` and `z` is an integer between 0 and 28. The loop does not change the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or the contents of stdin.
