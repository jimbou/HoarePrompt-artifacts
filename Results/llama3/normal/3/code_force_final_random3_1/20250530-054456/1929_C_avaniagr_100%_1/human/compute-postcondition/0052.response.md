Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is an integer between -1 and 98 + (z // (k - 1) + 1), `x - k + 3` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one line**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions `x - k + 3` is greater than 0 and stdin contains at least one line are still valid.
