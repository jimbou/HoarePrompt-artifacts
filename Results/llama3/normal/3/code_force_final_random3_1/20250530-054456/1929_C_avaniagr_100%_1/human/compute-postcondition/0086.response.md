Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `z` is equal to `k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (previous value of z) // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x - k + 3` times, stdin contains at least one line, `i` is `x - k + 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as integers. The value of `z` is updated `x - k + 3` times, each time adding the result of the division of the previous value of `z` by `k - 1` plus 1. The loop variable `i` is equal to `x - k + 2` after the loop finishes executing. The input stream `stdin` still contains at least one line.
