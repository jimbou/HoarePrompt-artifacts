Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `z` is equal to `k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, stdin contains at least one line, `x - k + 3` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, `x - k + 3`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one line.
