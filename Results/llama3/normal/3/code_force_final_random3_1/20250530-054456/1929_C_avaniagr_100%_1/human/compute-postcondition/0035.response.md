Postcondition: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line, `z` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
