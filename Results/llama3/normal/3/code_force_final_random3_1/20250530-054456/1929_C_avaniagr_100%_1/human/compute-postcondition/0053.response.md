To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x - k + 3`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 100.

To make the loop execute again, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The values of `x` and `k` remain the same.

State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is an integer between -1 and 98 + (z // (k - 1) + 1), `x - k + 3` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least one line**
