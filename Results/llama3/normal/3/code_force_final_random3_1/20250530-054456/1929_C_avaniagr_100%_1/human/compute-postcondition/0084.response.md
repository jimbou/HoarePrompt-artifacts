The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, x and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `x` and `k`. If `i` is less than `x - k + 3`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x - k + 3` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `x - k + 3` must be greater than 2.
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `z` is equal to `k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k-2 + (k-2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, stdin contains at least one line, `x - k + 3` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
