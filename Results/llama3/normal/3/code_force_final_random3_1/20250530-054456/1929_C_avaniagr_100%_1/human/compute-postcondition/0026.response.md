Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 and greater than `k`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains at least one line, `z` is an integer between 3 and 61, `i` is 2**

The value of `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to it. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `z // (k - 1)` can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, `z` is incremented by either 1 or 2. As a result, the new value of `z` is between 3 and 61. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
