Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 2, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is an integer between -1 and 99 + (x - k + 3 - 1) * (z // (k - 1) + 1), `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
