The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, x and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `k`. If `x - k + 3` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `z` is equal to `k-2`, stdin contains at least one line does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `x - k + 3` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `z` is equal to `k-2`, stdin contains at least one line, `x - k + 3` is greater than 0, i is 0**
