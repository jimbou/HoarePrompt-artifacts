Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, and `z` is an integer between 0 and 28.**

In this output state, the value of `z` is calculated as `k - 2`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 30. Therefore, `z` is an integer between 0 and 28. The values of the other variables, `k`, `x`, `a`, and the contents of stdin, remain unchanged. The conditions `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1` are still valid.
