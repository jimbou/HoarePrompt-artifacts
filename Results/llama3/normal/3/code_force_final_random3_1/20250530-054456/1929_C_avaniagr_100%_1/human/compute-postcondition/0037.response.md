Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, where `z` is an integer between 0 and 10^9 and `i` is `x - k + 2`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
