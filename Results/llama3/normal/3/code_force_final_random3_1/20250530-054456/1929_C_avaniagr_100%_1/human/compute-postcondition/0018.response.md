Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line, and the current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.***
