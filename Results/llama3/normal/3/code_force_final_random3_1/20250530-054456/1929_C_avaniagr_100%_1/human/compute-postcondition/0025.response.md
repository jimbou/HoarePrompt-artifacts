The only variables in the loop head are variables `i`, `x`, and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `x`, and `k`. If `i` is less than `x - k + 3`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 and greater than `k - 2`, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 30. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than `k - 2 + 2` and `k` remains the same.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 and greater than `k`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `stdin` contains at least one line, `z` is an integer between 2 and 30, `i` is 2**
