Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least one line, `z` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `i` is `x - k + 2`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The value of `z` has increased to a value between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the value of `i` is now equal to `x - k + 2`, which is the final value of the loop counter after the loop has finished executing.
