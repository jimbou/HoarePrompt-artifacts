According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one fewer input than initially**
