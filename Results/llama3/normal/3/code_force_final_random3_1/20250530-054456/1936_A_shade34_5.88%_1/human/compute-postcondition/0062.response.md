Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 and has at least 3 elements, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', and `mak` is 0 or 1.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` clears the output buffer, so the output buffer is now empty. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output buffer previously contained '? 0 0 1 1', but this is no longer the case after the flush operation.
