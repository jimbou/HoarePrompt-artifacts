Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 0, if s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, otherwise pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, the current value of s is either '>' or '=', the output buffer has been flushed n times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of i (which is n-1), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2).***
