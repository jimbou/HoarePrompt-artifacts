Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', `mak` is 1, and the output buffer has been flushed twice, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. The current value of the input is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output buffer and input values are still the same.
