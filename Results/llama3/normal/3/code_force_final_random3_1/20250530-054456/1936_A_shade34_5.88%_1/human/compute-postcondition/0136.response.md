Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1` and must have at least 3 elements, the output buffer is empty, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', `mak` is either 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak`, followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), and the output buffer has been flushed `n+1` times. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` is 0.**
