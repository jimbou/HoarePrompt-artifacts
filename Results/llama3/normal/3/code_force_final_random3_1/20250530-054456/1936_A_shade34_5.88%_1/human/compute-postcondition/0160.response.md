Based on the precondition, the variables and objects have the following values:

* `n` is an integer greater than 2.
* `i` is 2.
* `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
* `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 0, since `s` is '<'.
* The loop variable `_` is 1.
* The output buffer is empty, and the previous output was flushed.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`

The print statement will output the following values:

* '?' is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak` is 1, so it will be printed as 1.
* `mak` is printed again, so it will be printed as 1 again.
* `i` is 2, so it will be printed as 2.
* `i` is printed again, so it will be printed as 2 again.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
