Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 and has at least 4 elements, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', and if the user input is '>', then `mak` is 2, otherwise `mak` remains 0 or 1. The output buffer now contains '?' followed by the 0th or 1st or 2nd element of the list `pans` repeated twice, followed by the 3rd element of the list `pans` repeated twice.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer now contains a specific string that was printed before flushing the buffer. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `pans`, `s`, and `mak` remain unchanged.
