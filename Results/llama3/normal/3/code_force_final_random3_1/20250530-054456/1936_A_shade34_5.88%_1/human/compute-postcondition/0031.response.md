Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string containing the input value '=', `pans` is a list containing the value 0, and the output remains ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` is appended to the list `pans`. Since `i` is 0, the list `pans` now contains the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being at least 1, `s` still being a string containing the input value '=', and the output still being ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2.
