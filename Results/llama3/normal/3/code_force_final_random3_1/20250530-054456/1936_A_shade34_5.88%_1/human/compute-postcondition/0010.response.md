The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak` repeated twice, and the value of `i` repeated twice. 
The value of `mak` is either 1 or 0, depending on whether the input from stdin is '<' or not. 
The value of `i` is 2.
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is either 1 or 0 depending on the input from stdin)**
