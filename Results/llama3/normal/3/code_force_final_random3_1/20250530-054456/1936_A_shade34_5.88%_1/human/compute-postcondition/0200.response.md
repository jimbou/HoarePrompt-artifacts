Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n, the output buffer is empty, s is a string. If s is '<', then pans is [n-1], mak is n-1, and mak2 is 0. If s is '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-2. In all cases, mak and mak2 remain unchanged if s is not '<'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, as the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
* The output buffer is empty, as the loop flushes the output buffer after each iteration.
* The value of `s` is a string, as it is read from the input in each iteration.
* If `s` is '<', then `pans` contains only the last element `n-1`, `mak` is set to `n-1`, and `mak2` is set to 0.
* If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains `n-1` elements, all equal to `n-1`.
* If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', then `pans` contains `n-1` elements, all equal to `n-2`.
* In all cases, `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged if `s` is not '<'.
