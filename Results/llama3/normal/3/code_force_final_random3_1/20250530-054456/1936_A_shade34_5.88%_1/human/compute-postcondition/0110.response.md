The code prints a string containing a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<', their values are integers in the range 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) or 0 if `s` is '<'. The value of `i` is 1.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 1 [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are integers in the range 0 to n-2 or 0 if s is '<')**
