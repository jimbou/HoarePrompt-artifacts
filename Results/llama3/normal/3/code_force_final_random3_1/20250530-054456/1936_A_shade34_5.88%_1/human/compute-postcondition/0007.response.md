Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `_` is 0, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially. The current value of the input from stdin is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The console still displays `? 0 0 1 1`, and the stdin still contains at least one fewer input than initially, with the current value being '<'.
