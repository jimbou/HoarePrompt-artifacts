Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, "? 0 0 1 1" is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and the output buffer is flushed. The value of `mak` and `i` is printed. The printed value is: ? 3 3 3 3.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 3. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `mak` and `i` is printed, resulting in the output "? 3 3 3 3".
