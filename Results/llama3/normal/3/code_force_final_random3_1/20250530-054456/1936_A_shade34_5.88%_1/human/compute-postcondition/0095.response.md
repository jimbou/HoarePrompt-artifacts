Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', the output buffer has been flushed four times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1 or 2), followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1 or 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 3), followed by the value of `i` (which is 3). If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3.***
