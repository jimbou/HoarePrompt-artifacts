To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pans`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(pans)` is at least 2, since the range starts from 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1` and must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer is empty, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', the output buffer has been flushed `n` times, `mak` is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 0), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), followed by the value of `i` (which is 1), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<')**
