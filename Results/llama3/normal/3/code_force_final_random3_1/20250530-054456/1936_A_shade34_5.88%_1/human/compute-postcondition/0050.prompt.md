Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least 4, i is n-1, mak is either n-1 or 1, mak2 is either n-1 or 1, pans is an empty list, stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 1, i is 0, s is a string containing the input value, and the input buffer is empty. If s is '<', then mak is 0, pans is [0], and the output remains ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with the output still being ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2, and the string s not equal to '<' or '='.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is at least 2, i is 1, s is a string containing the input value. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output is ?, 1, mak2, 1, mak2. If s is '=', then pans is [0, 1]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the program remains unchanged, with the output still being ?, mak, mak2, 1, mak2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 3, i is 2, s is a string containing the input value. If s is '<', then mak is 2, pans is [2], and the output is ?, 2, mak2, 1, mak2. If s is '=', then pans is [0, 1, 2]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the program remains unchanged, with the output still being ?, mak, mak2, 1, mak2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
