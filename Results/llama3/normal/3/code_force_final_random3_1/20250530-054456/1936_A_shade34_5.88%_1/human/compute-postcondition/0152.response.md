To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<', and the loop variable `_` is 1**
