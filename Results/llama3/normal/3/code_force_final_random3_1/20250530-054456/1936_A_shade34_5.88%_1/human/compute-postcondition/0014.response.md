Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input from stdin is '<', then `mak` is 2 and "? 1 1 2 2" is printed. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and "? 0 0 2 2" is printed.***
