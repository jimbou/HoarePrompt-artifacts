Output State: **n is an integer, i is n, pans is a list containing all values from 0 to n, the output buffer is empty, s is '=' or '>', mak is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` has been updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `i` remains the same as the original value of `n`. The list `pans` still contains all values from 0 to the original value of `n`. The output buffer is empty, and the output buffer has been flushed. The value of `s` remains either '=' or '>', as it was not modified by the code. The value of `mak` has been reset to 0.
