Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least n, i is n-1, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, s is '=' or '>', the output buffer has been flushed n-1 times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of mak (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of i (which is n-1), followed by the value of i (which is n-1). If the input is '<', then mak is n-1, mak2 is mak.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, i is 0, if s is '<', then pans is a list containing 0, otherwise if s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, otherwise pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, the current value of s is either '<', '>' or '=', the output buffer has been flushed n times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'), followed by the value of i (which is 0 if s is '<', otherwise n-1), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<').

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, i is 1, s is either '<', '>' or '=', the output buffer is empty and has been flushed n+1 times, the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are being printed, s is a string containing a single character input from the user. If s is '<', then pans is a list containing 1, mak is 1, and mak2 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'. If s is not '<', then pans is a list containing 1 if s is '<', otherwise if s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, 1, otherwise pans is a list containing 1, and mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is either '<', '>' or '=', the output buffer is empty and has been flushed n+1 times, the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are being printed, s is a string containing a single character input from the user. If s is '<', then pans is a list containing 1, mak is 2, and mak2 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing 1, 2, mak is 1, and mak2 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'. If s is '>', then pans is a list containing 1, mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
