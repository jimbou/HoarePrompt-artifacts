The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must contain at least one integer and the integer must be greater than 0 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains at least one integer that is greater than 0, _ is 0**
