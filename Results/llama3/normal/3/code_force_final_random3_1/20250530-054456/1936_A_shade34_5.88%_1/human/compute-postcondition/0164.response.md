Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, `mak2` is 0, and the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [2] [2] [2] [2]. Otherwise, `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged, and the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i].***
