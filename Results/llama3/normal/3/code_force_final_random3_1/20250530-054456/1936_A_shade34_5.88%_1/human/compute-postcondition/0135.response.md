The code prints a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `mak`, which is either 0 or 1 depending on the input. The next two characters are the value of `mak` repeated, which is either 0 or 1. Then, the value of `i` is printed, which is 2. Finally, the value of `i` is printed again, which is also 2.

Since `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `pans` must have at least 3 elements. However, the values of `pans[0]` and `pans[2]` are not explicitly defined in the precondition. Therefore, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where mak is either 0 or 1, and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**
