Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', the output buffer is empty and has been flushed `n+1` times, the string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` are being printed, `s` is a string containing a single character input from the user. If `s` is '<', then `pans` is a list containing 1, 2, `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'. If `s` is not '<', then `pans` is a list containing 1, 2 if `s` is '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing 1, 2, and `mak` and `mak2` are either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer and the printing of the string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` are still the same. The value of `s` is still a single character input from the user, and its value determines the values of `pans`, `mak`, and `mak2`.
