Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 0, s is '<', mak is 0, pans is [0], and the output remains ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The string `s` still contains the input value '<'. The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The list `pans` is initialized with the value of `i`, which is also 0. The output remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
