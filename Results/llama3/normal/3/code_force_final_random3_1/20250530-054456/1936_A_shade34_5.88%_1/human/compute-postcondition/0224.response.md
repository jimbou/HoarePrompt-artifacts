Output State: **The output buffer is empty, n is greater than or equal to 1, i is n, s is a string. If s is '<', then pans is [n-1], mak is 0, and mak2 is 0. If s is '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-1, mak is 0, and mak2 remains unchanged. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-2, mak is 0, and mak2 remains unchanged, and this is printed: '!', the value of mak2 which is 0, and the value of mak which is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the output buffer is now empty because sys.stdout.flush() has been executed, which flushes the output buffer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
