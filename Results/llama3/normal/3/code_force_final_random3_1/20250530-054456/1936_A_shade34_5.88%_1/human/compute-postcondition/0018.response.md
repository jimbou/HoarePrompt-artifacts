Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input from stdin is '<', then `mak` is 2 and "? 1 1 2 2" is printed. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and "? 0 0 2 2" is printed. The value of `mak` and `i` is printed. If the input from stdin is '<', then the printed value is: ? 2 2 3 3. Otherwise, the printed value is: ? 1 1 3 3.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is immediately written to the console. Since the output buffer is already flushed in the initial state, this code does not change the state of the program. The values of `n`, `i`, and `mak` remain the same, and the console output remains the same. The stdin still contains at least one fewer input than initially.
