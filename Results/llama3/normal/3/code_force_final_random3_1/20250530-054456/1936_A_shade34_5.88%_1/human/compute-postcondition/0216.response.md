The code prints a string containing the character '?', followed by the elements at indices `mak` and `i` of the `pans` list, each repeated twice. Since `mak` is 2 and `i` is 3, the elements at indices 2 and 3 of the `pans` list will be printed.

Output: **? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[2] and pans[3] are the elements at indices 2 and 3 of the pans list)**
