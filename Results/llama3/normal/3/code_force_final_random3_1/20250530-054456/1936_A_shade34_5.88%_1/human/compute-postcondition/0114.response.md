Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', `pans` is a list containing 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise if `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing 0, 1, otherwise `pans` is a list containing 1, the output buffer is empty and has been flushed `n+1` times, `mak` and `mak2` are either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'. The string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` are being printed, `s` is a string containing a single character input from the user.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains greater than 1, `i` is still 1, and `s` is still either '<', '>' or '='. The list `pans` now contains the value 1 if `s` is '<', or 0 and 1 if `s` is '=', or just 1 if `s` is '>'. The output buffer remains empty and has been flushed `n+1` times. The values of `mak` and `mak2` are still either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'. The string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` are still being printed, and `s` is still a string containing a single character input from the user.
