Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, pans is a list containing 0, the output buffer is empty, s is '<', the output buffer has been flushed n times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 0), followed by the value of mak2 (which is 0), followed by the value of i (which is 0), followed by the value of mak2 (which is 0).**

The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `mak` and then appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `pans`. The rest of the variables and the output buffer remain unchanged.
