This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a sequence of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it finds the maximum and second maximum elements in the sequence and prints them in the format '!', max, second_max. The function repeats this process for all test cases and then terminates, leaving the output buffer empty.
