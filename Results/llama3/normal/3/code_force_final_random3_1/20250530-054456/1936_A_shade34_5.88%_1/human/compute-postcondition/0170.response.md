Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3, the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [3] [3] [3] [3] and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] or ? [2] [2] [2] [2] depending on the input, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [3] [3] and the output buffer is flushed.***
