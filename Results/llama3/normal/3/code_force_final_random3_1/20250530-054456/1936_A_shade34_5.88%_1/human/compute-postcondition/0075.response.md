To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the loop variable `_` and the range object created by `range(int(input()))`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to worry about its state.

The range object is created by calling `int(input())`, which means the loop will iterate over a range of numbers from 0 to the input value minus 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is at least n
* `i` is n-1
* `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1
* The output buffer is empty
* `s` is '=' or '>'
* `mak` is n-1
* The output buffer has been flushed

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the range object. If the loop is to execute again, the range object must have at least one more value to iterate over. This means the input value must be at least `n+1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least n+1, `i` is n, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', `mak` is n, and the output buffer has been flushed**
