Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', `mak` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed twice, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means it forces any buffered output to be written to the output device. Since the output buffer is already empty and has been flushed, the effect of this code is to flush the output buffer again. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `pans`, `s`, and `mak` are not affected by this code. The output buffer remains empty, and the output buffer has been flushed twice. The printed output remains the same: ? 0 0 1 1.
