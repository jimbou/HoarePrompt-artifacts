Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, the output buffer is '?1(n-2)1(n-2)' if `s` is '<', '?1mak2i(mak2)' if `s` is '=', and '?1mak2i(mak2)' if `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `s` is a string, `pans` is [0, 1, 1] if `s` is '<', [0, 1, 1] if `s` is '=', and [1] if `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<', `mak2` is `n-2` if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 1, to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer and the values of `mak` and `mak2` depend on the value of `s`, which is a string.
