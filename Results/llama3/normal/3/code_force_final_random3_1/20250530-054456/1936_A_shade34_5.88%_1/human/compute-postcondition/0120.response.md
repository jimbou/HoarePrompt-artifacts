Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is either '<', '>' or '=', the output buffer is empty and has been flushed n+1 times, the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are being printed, s is a string containing a single character input from the user. If s is '<', then pans is a list containing 1, mak is 1, and mak2 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'. If s is not '<', then pans is a list containing 1 if s is '<', otherwise if s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, 1, otherwise pans is a list containing 1, and mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'. The string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are being printed.**

The first line flushes the output buffer, which is already empty and has been flushed n+1 times. This line does not change the state of any variables. The second line assigns the user's input to s, which is a string containing a single character. The value of s is either '<', '>' or '='. The rest of the state remains the same.
