To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state variables involved in it.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (because of how `range(n)` works in Python, incrementing `i` by 1 is implicit in the loop's operation), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` is still greater than 0 but must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
- `i` is 1.

All other state variables (`s`, `pans`, the output buffer, `mak`, `mak2`) are not directly affected by the loop head and therefore do not change based on the loop's iteration logic alone.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<', otherwise if `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing 0, otherwise `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer is not empty and has been flushed `n` times, `mak` and `mak2` are either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'.**
