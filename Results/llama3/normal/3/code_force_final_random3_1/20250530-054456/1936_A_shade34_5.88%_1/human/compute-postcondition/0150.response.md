State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', `mak` is either 0 or `n-1`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak`, followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-1`), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), and the output buffer has been flushed `n+1` times, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or `n-1`), and the output buffer has been flushed, the loop variable `_` is 1**
