Based on the precondition, we know that `n` is at least 1 and `i` is 0. However, the precondition does not provide any information about the values of `mak` and `mak2`.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the precondition, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise description of the output.

Output: **?, [unknown value of mak], [unknown value of mak2], 0, [unknown value of mak2]**
