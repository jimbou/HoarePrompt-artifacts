Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables `mak2` and `mak` as follows:

* If `s` is '<', then `mak2` is 0 and `mak` is 0.
* If `s` is '=', then `mak2` remains unchanged (but its initial value is not specified, so we can't determine its exact value) and `mak` is 0.
* If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', then `mak2` remains unchanged (but its initial value is not specified, so we can't determine its exact value) and `mak` is 0.

Since `mak` is 0 in all cases, we can conclude that the value of `mak` is 0.

The value of `mak2` is not specified in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe its value as "unchanged" or "unknown".

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **! 0 0 (where mak2 is an unknown or unchanged value)**
