The code prints a string that starts with '?', followed by the value of `pans[mak]` (which is `pans[0]` since `mak` is 0), followed by the value of `pans[mak]` again (which is `pans[0]` since `mak` is 0), followed by the value of `pans[i]` (which is `pans[1]` since `i` is 1), followed by the value of `pans[i]` again (which is `pans[1]` since `i` is 1).

Since `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, `pans[0]` is 0 and `pans[1]` is 1.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
