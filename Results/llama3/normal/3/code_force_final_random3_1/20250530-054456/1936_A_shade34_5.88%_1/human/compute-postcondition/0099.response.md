Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`

From the initial state, we know:

* `n` is greater than 0.
* `i` is 0.
* `pans` is an empty list (not used in the print statement).
* The output buffer is empty (not relevant to the print statement).
* `s` is '=' or '>', but its value is not used in the print statement.
* The output buffer has been flushed `n-1` times (not relevant to the print statement).
* `mak` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`.
* If the input is '<', then `mak` is `n-1`, and `mak2` is `mak`.

Since `i` is 0, the value of `i` in the print statement will be 0.

The value of `mak` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`, but we don't know the exact value. Similarly, the value of `mak2` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`, but we don't know the exact value.

However, if the input is '<', then `mak` is `n-1`, and `mak2` is `mak`, which means `mak2` is also `n-1`.

So, the print statement will output:

* '?' (a literal string)
* The value of `mak` (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`, or `n-1` if the input is '<')
* The value of `mak2` (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`, or `n-1` if the input is '<')
* The value of `i` (which is 0)
* The value of `mak2` (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`, or `n-1` if the input is '<')

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 0 [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2, or n-1 if the input is '<')**
