Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, i is n, pans is a list containing all values from 0 to n, the output buffer is empty, s is '=' or '>', mak is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', and the output buffer has been flushed twice, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', and the output buffer has been flushed three times, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 2), followed by the value of `mak` (which is 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2). Otherwise, `mak` is 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or 1), followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or 1), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', the output buffer has been flushed four times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1 or 2), followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1 or 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 3), followed by the value of `i` (which is 3). If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
