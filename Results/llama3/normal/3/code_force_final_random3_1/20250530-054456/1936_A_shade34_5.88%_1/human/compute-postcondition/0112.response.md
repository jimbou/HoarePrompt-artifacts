Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, s is either '<', '>' or '=', pans is a list containing 0 if s is '<', otherwise if s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, otherwise pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty and has been flushed n+1 times, mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'. The string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are being printed, s is a string containing a single character input from the user.**

The first line flushes the output buffer, which has already been flushed `n` times, so the total number of flushes becomes `n+1`. The second line reads a single character input from the user and assigns it to `s`. The values of `n`, `i`, `pans`, `mak`, and `mak2` remain unchanged. The output buffer is now empty after the flush. The string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` are still being printed.
