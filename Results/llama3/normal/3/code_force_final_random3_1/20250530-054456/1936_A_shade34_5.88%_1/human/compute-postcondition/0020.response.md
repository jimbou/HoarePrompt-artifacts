Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `mak` is either 3 or 1, depending on whether the input from stdin is '<' or not. The value of `mak` and `i` is printed. If the input from stdin is '<', then the printed value is: ? 3 3 3 3. Otherwise, the printed value is: ? 1 1 3 3. In both cases, "? 0 0 1 1" is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and the output buffer is flushed.***
