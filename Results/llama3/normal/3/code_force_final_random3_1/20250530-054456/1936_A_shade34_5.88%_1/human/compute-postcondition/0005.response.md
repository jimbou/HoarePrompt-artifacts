The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to force the output buffer to be written to the console. This means that any output that has been printed but not yet displayed will be displayed immediately.

In the initial state, the following is printed: `? 0 0 1 1`. This output is not yet displayed because it is still in the output buffer.

After executing the code `sys.stdout.flush()`, the output buffer is flushed, and the printed output `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed immediately.

The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` are not affected by this code, so they remain the same.

The stdin still contains at least one fewer input than initially.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially.**
