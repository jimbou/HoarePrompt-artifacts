Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`

From the initial state, we know:

* `mak` is 0
* `i` is 1

So, when the print statement is executed, it will print:

* The string '?' (a literal string)
* The value of `mak`, which is 0
* The value of `mak` again, which is still 0
* The value of `i`, which is 1
* The value of `i` again, which is still 1

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**

Note that the values of `n`, `stdin`, and `_` are not relevant to the print statement, so they are not included in the output description.
