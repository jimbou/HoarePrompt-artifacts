Output: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input from stdin is '<', then `mak` is 2 and "? 1 1 2 2" is printed. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and "? 0 0 2 2" is printed. The value of `mak` and `i` is printed. If the input from stdin is '<', then the printed value is: ? 2 2 3 3. Otherwise, the printed value is: ? 1 1 3 3.**
