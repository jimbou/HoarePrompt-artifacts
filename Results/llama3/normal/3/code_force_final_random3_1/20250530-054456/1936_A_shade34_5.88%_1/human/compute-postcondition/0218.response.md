Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `pans` has at least 4 elements, the output buffer is empty, `s` is a string, `mak` is 2, and this is printed: ? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3] and the output buffer is flushed**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `pans`, `s`, and `mak` remain unchanged. The output buffer, which was empty, is now flushed, meaning that any pending output is sent to the output device. The printed text "? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3]" is still present in the output.
