Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, s is '=' or '>', the output buffer has been flushed n-1 times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of mak (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of i (which is n-1), followed by the value of i (which is n-1). If the input is '<', then mak is n-1, mak2 is mak.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is `n-1`. The list `pans` is now empty as it was reassigned to an empty list in the second line of the code. The output buffer remains empty as there were no new outputs added. The value of `s` is still either '=' or '>', and the output buffer has still been flushed `n-1` times. The printed output remains the same, with '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`), followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`), followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-1`), followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-1`). Additionally, if the input is '<', then `mak` is `n-1`, and `mak2` is assigned the value of `mak`.
