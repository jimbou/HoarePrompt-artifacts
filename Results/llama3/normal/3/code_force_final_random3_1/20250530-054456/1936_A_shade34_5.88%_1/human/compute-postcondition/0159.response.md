To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we know that `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, such as `pans`, `s`, `mak`, `mak2`, and the output buffer, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, if `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 0, otherwise `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged, and the loop variable `_` is 1, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed.**
