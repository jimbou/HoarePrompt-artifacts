Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is either `n-1` or 1, depending on whether the input from stdin is '<' or not. The value of `mak` and `i` is printed. If the input from stdin is '<', then the printed value is: ? `n-1` `n-1` `n-1` `n-1`. Otherwise, the printed value is: ? 1 1 `n-1` `n-1`. In both cases, "? 0 0 1 1" is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated `n-1` times, and the value of `mak` is either `n-1` or 1, depending on the input from stdin. The loop has printed the values of `mak` and `i` in the format "? `mak` `mak` `i` `i`" for each iteration. The console displays the initial print statement "? 0 0 1 1", and the output buffer is flushed. The stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially.
