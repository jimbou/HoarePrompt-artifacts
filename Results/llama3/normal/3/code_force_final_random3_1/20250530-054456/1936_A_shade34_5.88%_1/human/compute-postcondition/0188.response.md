Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 1, the output buffer is '?1(n-2)1(n-2)' if s is '<', '?1mak2i(mak2)' if s is '=', and '?1mak2i(mak2)' if s is neither '<' nor '=', s is a string, pans is [1], mak is 1, mak2 is n-2 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<'.**

The code modifies the values of `mak` and `pans`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, making `mak` equal to 1. The second line appends the value of `i` to `pans`, making `pans` equal to `[1]`. The value of `mak2` is only affected if `s` is '<', in which case it remains unchanged. The output buffer and the values of `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
