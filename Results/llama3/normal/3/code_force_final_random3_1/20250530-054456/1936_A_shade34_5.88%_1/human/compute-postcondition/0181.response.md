Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `pans` is a list containing a single element 0, the output buffer is empty, `s` is a string and equals to '=', and `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `i` is still 0, but it has been appended to the `pans` list, which now contains a single element, 0. The other variables, `n`, `s`, `mak`, and `mak2`, remain unchanged, and the output buffer is still empty.
