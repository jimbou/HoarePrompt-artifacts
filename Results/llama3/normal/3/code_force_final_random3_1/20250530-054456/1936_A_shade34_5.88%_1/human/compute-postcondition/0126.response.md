Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to n, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', the output buffer has been flushed `n` times, `mak` is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 0), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), followed by the value of `i` (which is `n`), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<').**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mak` has been reset to 0, while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The output buffer still contains the same printed values, but now `mak` is specifically 0.
