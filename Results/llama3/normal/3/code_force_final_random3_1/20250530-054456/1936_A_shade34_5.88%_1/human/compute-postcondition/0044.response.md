Output: **n is at least 3, i is 2, s is a string containing the input value. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output is ?, 1, mak2, 1, mak2. If s is '=', then pans is [0, 1]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the program remains unchanged, with the output still being ?, mak, mak2, 1, mak2. and this is printed: ?, the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2**
