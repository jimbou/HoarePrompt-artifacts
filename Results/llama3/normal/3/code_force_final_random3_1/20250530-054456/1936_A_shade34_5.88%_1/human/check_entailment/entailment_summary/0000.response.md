Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find the maximum and second maximum elements in the sequence and prints them in the required format. The program also handles the input and output operations correctly, flushing the output buffer after each print statement to ensure that the output is displayed immediately.

The program's logic is also correct. It first finds the maximum element in the sequence by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the second maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum and the current second maximum. Finally, it prints the maximum and second maximum elements in the required format.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if there is only one element in the sequence, it correctly prints that element as both the maximum and second maximum.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
