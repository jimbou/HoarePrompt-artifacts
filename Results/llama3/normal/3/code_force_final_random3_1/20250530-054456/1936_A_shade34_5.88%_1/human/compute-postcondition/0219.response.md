Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `pans` has at least 4 elements, `mak` is 3, `s` is a string, the output buffer is empty, and the output buffer contains the string: ? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3]**.

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the string: ? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3], and it is empty after being flushed.
