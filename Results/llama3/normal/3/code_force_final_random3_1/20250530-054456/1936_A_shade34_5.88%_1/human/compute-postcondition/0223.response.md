Output: **n is greater than or equal to 1, i is n, the output buffer is empty, s is a string. If s is '<', then pans is [n-1], mak is 0, and mak2 is 0. If s is '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-1, mak is 0, and mak2 remains unchanged. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-2, mak is 0, and mak2 remains unchanged, and this is printed: '!', the value of mak2 which is 0, and the value of mak which is 0**
