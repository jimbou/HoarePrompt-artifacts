Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 1, the output buffer is '?1(n-2)1(n-2)' if s is '<', '?1mak2i(mak2)' if s is '=', and '?1mak2i(mak2)' if s is neither '<' nor '=', s is a string, if s is '<', pans is [1], mak is 1, and mak2 is n-2. If s is '=', pans is [0, 1, 1], otherwise pans is [0, 1] if s is '<', and an empty list if s is neither '<' nor '=', mak is 1 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<', mak2 is n-2 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<'.***
