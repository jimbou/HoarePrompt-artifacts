Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n-1, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, if s is '<', then mak is n-1 and mak2 is n-1, otherwise mak and mak2 remain unchanged, and the loop variable _ is n-1, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] for i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is `n-1`. The list `pans` is now empty because it is reassigned to an empty list in the second line of the code. The output buffer is still empty as there are no new print statements in the code. The values of `mak` and `mak2` are updated only if `s` is '<'. If `s` is '<', then `mak` remains `n-1` and `mak2` becomes `n-1` because it is assigned the value of `mak` in the first line of the code. The loop variable `_` is still `n-1` as it is not modified by the code. The print statements and the output buffer flushing remain the same as they are not affected by the code.
