Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n, the output buffer is empty, s is a string. If s is '<', then pans is [n-1], mak is 0, and mak2 is 0. If s is '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-1, mak is 0, and mak2 remains unchanged. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-2, mak is 0, and mak2 remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been changed to 0, regardless of the initial value of `s`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
