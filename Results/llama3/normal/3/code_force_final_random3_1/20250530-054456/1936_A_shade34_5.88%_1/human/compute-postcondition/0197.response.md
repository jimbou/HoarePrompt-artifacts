Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a string, if `s` is '<', `pans` is [1, 2], `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is `n-2`. If `s` is '=', `pans` is [0, 1, 1], otherwise `pans` is [0, 1] if `s` is '<', and an empty list if `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<', `mak2` is `n-2` if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `mak` and `mak2` are still dependent on the value of `s`.
