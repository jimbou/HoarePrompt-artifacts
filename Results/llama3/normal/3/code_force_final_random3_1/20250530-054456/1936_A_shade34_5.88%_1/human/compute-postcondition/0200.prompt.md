Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n-1, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, if s is '<', then mak is n-1 and mak2 is n-1, otherwise mak and mak2 remain unchanged, and the loop variable _ is n-1, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] for i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, the output buffer is empty, s is a string. If s is '<', then pans is [0], mak is 0, and mak2 is n-1. If s is '=', then pans is [0]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is an empty list. In all cases, mak and mak2 remain unchanged if s is not '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 1, the output buffer is '?1(n-2)1(n-2)' if s is '<', '?1mak2i(mak2)' if s is '=', and '?1mak2i(mak2)' if s is neither '<' nor '=', s is a string, if s is '<', pans is [1], mak is 1, and mak2 is n-2. If s is '=', pans is [0, 1, 1], otherwise pans is [0, 1] if s is '<', and an empty list if s is neither '<' nor '=', mak is 1 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<', mak2 is n-2 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 2, s is a string. If s is '<', pans is [2] and mak is 2, otherwise if s is '<', pans is [1, 2] and mak is 1. If s is '=', pans is [0, 1, 1]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', pans is [0, 1] if s is '<', and an empty list if s is neither '<' nor '='. mak2 is n-2 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
