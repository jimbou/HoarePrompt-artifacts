To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already an integer greater than or equal to 1, we don't need to adjust its state.

However, we need to adjust the state of `i`. Since the loop will iterate from 0 to `n-1`, we need to set `i` to 0 for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, if `s` is '<', then `mak` is `n-1` and `mak2` is `n-1`, otherwise `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged, and the loop variable `_` is `n-1`, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed.**
