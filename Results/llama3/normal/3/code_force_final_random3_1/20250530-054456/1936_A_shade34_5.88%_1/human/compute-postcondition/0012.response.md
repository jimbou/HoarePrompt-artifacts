Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input from stdin is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2" if the input from stdin is '<', otherwise "? 0 0 2 2", and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any buffered output is immediately written to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the console output and stdin state are also unchanged.
