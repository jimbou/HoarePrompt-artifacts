Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, if `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 0, otherwise `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged, and the loop variable `_` is 1, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any pending output is sent to the output device. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `pans`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the output buffer is empty. The output buffer is flushed, which means that the output is sent to the output device, but the output buffer itself is empty.
