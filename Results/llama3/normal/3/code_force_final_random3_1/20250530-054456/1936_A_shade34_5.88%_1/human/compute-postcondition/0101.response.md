Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, s is either '<' or '>', the output buffer has been flushed n times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of i (which is n-1), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2). If the input is '<', then mak is n-1, mak2 is mak.**

The first line flushes the output buffer, which has already been flushed n-1 times, so it is now flushed n times. The second line reads a string input and assigns it to s. Since the input is either '<' or '>', s becomes either '<' or '>'. The values of n, i, and pans remain unchanged. The output buffer remains empty. The printed output remains the same, with the values of mak, mak2, and i as specified in the initial state.
