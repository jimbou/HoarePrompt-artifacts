The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, s is a string containing the input value, and the input buffer is empty. If s is '<', then mak is 0, pans is [0], and the output remains ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with the output still being ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2, and the string s not equal to '<' or '='.**
