Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 2, s is a string. If s is '<', pans is [2] and mak is 2, otherwise if s is '<', pans is [1, 2] and mak is 1. If s is '=', pans is [0, 1, 1]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', pans is [0, 1] if s is '<', and an empty list if s is neither '<' nor '='. mak2 is n-2 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<'.***
