Output State: **n is a positive integer, mak is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially**

In this output state, the value of `n` is a positive integer because it is assigned the value of the first integer from stdin, which is greater than 0. The value of `mak` is 0 because it is explicitly assigned this value in the code. The value of `_` remains 0 because it is not modified by the code. Stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially because one integer is read and assigned to `n`.
