Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', `mak` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed three times, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 2), followed by the value of `mak` (which is 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2)**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the previously printed values, and the output buffer has been flushed three times.
