Output: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, s is '=' or '>', the output buffer has been flushed n-1 times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2), followed by the value of i (which is n-1), followed by the value of mak2 (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2). If the input is '<', then mak is n-1, mak2 is mak.**
