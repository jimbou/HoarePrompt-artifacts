To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', the output buffer is empty and has been flushed n+1 times, the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are being printed, s is a string containing a single character input from the user. If s is '<', then pans is a list containing 1, mak is 1, and mak2 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'. If s is not '<', then pans is a list containing 1 if s is '<', otherwise if s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, 1, otherwise pans is a list containing 1, and mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<'.**
