Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 1, the output buffer is empty, s is a string. If s is '<', then pans is [0, 1], mak is 1, and mak2 is n-2. If s is '=', then pans is [0, 1]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is an empty list. In all cases, mak and mak2 remain unchanged if s is not '<'. The following is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak (which is 1 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<'), followed by the value of mak2 (which is n-2 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<'), followed by the value of i (which is 1), followed by the value of mak2 (which is n-2 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<').**
