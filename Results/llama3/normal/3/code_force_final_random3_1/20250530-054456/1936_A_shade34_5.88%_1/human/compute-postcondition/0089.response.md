Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is '=' or '>', and the output buffer has been flushed three times, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 2), followed by the value of `mak` (which is 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2). Otherwise, `mak` is 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or 1), followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or 1), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2).***
