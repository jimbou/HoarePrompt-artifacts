To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `s`, `mak`, `pans`, `mak2`, and the output, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **n is at least 3, i is 2, s is a string containing the input value. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output is ?, 1, mak2, 1, mak2. If s is '=', then pans is [0, 1]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the program remains unchanged, with the output still being ?, mak, mak2, 1, mak2.**
