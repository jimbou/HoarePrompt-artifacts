Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n-1, pans is a list containing all numbers from 0 to n-1, the output buffer is empty, if s is '<', then mak is n-1 and mak2 is 0, otherwise mak and mak2 remain unchanged, and the loop variable _ is n-1, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] for i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The value of `i` is now `n-1`.
* The list `pans` remains unchanged, containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
* The output buffer is empty.
* If the input is '<', then `mak` is now `n-1` and `mak2` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged.
* The loop variable `_` is now `n-1`.
* The output buffer is updated with the printed values: `? 0 0 1 1`, followed by `? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`. The output buffer is flushed after each iteration.
