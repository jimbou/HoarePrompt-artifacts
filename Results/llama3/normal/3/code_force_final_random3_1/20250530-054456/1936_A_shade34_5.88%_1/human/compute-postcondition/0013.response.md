Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `_` is 0, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and this is printed: "? 1 1 2 2" if the input from stdin is '<', otherwise "? 0 0 2 2", and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
