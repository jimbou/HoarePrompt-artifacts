Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, i is 0, s is a string containing the input value, and the input buffer is empty. If s is '<', then mak is 0, pans is [0], and the output remains ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with the output still being ?, mak, mak2, 0, mak2, and the string s not equal to '<' or '='.***
