Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] or ? [2] [2] [2] [2] depending on the input, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [3] [3] and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer has been flushed, meaning that any buffered output has been written to the output device. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `pans` remain unchanged, and the output buffer still contains the same text as before, but it has been flushed to ensure that it is visible to the user.
