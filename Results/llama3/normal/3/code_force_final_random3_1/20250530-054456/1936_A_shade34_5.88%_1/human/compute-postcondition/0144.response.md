Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1` and must have at least 4 elements, the output buffer is empty, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', `mak` is 3, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 3), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), followed by the value of `i` (which is 3), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), and the output buffer has been flushed `n+1` times. If the input is '>', then the output buffer has been flushed one more time. and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 3), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<'), followed by the value of `i` (which is 3), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<').**

In natural language, the output state is that `mak` is now assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The output buffer has been flushed and printed with the new value of `mak`.
