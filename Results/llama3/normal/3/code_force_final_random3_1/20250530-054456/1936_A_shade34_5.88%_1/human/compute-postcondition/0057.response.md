Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `s` is '>', `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1, `mak` is 1, and the output buffer contains '? 0 0 1 1'**.

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the previously printed string '? 0 0 1 1', and the current value of `s` is still '>'.
