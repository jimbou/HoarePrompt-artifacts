Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n, the output buffer is empty, s is a string. If s is '<', then pans is [n-1], mak is 0, and mak2 is 0. If s is '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-1, mak is 0, and mak2 remains unchanged. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is a list of n-1 elements, all equal to n-2, mak is 0, and mak2 remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` has at least 2 elements, the output buffer is empty, `s` is a string. If the current input is '>', '?' followed by the elements at index 1, 1, 1, and 1 of the list `pans` is printed to the console and the output buffer is flushed, and `mak` is 1. Otherwise, '?' followed by the elements at index mak, mak, 1, and 1 of the list `pans` is printed to the console and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `pans` has at least 3 elements, the output buffer is empty, `s` is a string, `mak` is 2. If the current input is '>', '?' followed by the elements at index 2, 2, 2, and 2 of the list `pans` is printed to the console and the output buffer is flushed. If the current input is not '>', the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `pans` has at least 4 elements, `s` is a string, the output buffer is empty. If the user input is '>', then `mak` is 3 and the output buffer contains the string: ? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3]. Otherwise, `mak` remains 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
