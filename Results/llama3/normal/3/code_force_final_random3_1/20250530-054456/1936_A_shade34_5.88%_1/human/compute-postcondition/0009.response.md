According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input from stdin is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially.**
