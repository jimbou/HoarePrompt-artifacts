Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer is empty, if `s` is '<', then `mak` is `n-1` and `mak2` is `n-1`, otherwise `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged, and the loop variable `_` is `n-1`, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where i is 0, and mak and mak2 are either n-1 if s is '<' or their unchanged values**
