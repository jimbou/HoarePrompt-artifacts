Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of elements in each sequence.
2. It uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum element in the sequence, which is correct.
3. Once it finds the maximum element, it uses another binary search-like approach to find the second maximum element, which is also correct.
4. It prints the maximum and second maximum elements in the correct format.
5. The program repeats this process for all test cases and leaves the output buffer empty at the end.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
