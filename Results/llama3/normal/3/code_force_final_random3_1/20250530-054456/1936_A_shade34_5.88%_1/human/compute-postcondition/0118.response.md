Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

The value of `mak` depends on the value of `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1. If `s` is not '<', then `mak` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0.

The value of `mak2` also depends on the value of `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak2` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0. If `s` is not '<', then `mak2` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0.

The value of `i` is 2.

Therefore, the output will be the string '?' followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value 2, and the value of `mak2` again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 2 [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are the values of mak and mak2 respectively, which depend on the value of s)**
