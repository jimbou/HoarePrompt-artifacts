To determine the output of the print statement, we need to consider the initial state and the conditions that affect the values of the variables involved.

1. **Value of `s`**: The value of `s` is crucial as it determines the values of `pans`, `mak`, and `mak2`. However, the exact value of `s` is not provided in the initial state. We have conditions for when `s` is '<', '=' , and when it is neither '<' nor '='.

2. **Values of `mak` and `mak2`**:
   - If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is `n-2`.
   - If `s` is not '<', then `mak` remains unchanged (but since we don't have an initial value for `mak` when `s` is not '<', we can't determine its exact value in this case) and `mak2` also remains unchanged (similarly, without an initial value for `mak2` when `s` is not '<', its exact value is undetermined).

3. **Value of `i`**: `i` is given as 2.

Given these considerations, the print statement `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)` will output a string that includes the character '?', followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

- If `s` is '<', then the output will include `mak` as 1, `mak2` as `n-2`, and `i` as 2. So, the output would be `? 1 (n-2) 2 (n-2)`.
- If `s` is not '<', without explicit initial values for `mak` and `mak2` in this condition, we cannot precisely determine the numerical values that will be printed for `mak` and `mak2`. However, we know `i` will be 2.

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `s` and consequently the exact values of `mak` and `mak2` when `s` is not '<', we'll provide output descriptions for both scenarios:

- **If `s` is '<'**: Output: **? 1 (n-2) 2 (n-2)**
- **If `s` is not '<'**: Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 2 [mak2]** (where `[mak]` and `[mak2]` represent the undetermined values of `mak` and `mak2` when `s` is not '<')
