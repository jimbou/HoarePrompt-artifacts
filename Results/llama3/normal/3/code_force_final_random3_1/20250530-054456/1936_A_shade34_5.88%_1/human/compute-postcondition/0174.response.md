The code prints a string with a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Based on the precondition, `mak` and `mak2` are either `n-1` or remain unchanged. Since `s` is '<', `mak` and `mak2` are set to `n-1`. 

The value of `i` is 0.

Therefore, the output will be a string with a question mark followed by `n-1`, `n-1`, 0, and `n-1` again.

Output: **? [n-1] [n-1] 0 [n-1] (where n-1 is the value of n minus 1)**
