Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `mak` and `mak2` are only assigned values if `s` is '<'. If `s` is not '<', their values remain unchanged. Since `s` is not specified to be '<' in the precondition, we cannot determine the exact values of `mak` and `mak2`. However, we can describe their values as "unchanged" or "undefined".
* `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
* `mak2` is printed twice, which is likely a typo and the intention was to print `pans` or another variable. However, based on the given code, we will assume that `mak2` is printed twice.

Considering the above points, the output of the print statement can be described as:

Output: **?, [unchanged or undefined value of mak], [unchanged or undefined value of mak2], 1, [unchanged or undefined value of mak2]**
