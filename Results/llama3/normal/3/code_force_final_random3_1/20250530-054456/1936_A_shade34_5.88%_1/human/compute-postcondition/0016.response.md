The code prints a string that starts with '?', followed by the value of `mak`, which is either 1 or 2 depending on the input from stdin, then another `mak`, then the value of `i` which is 3, and finally another `i` which is also 3.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where mak is either 1 or 2 depending on the input from stdin)**
