Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 1, the output buffer is '?1(n-2)1(n-2)' if s is '<', '?1mak2i(mak2)' if s is '=', and '?1mak2i(mak2)' if s is neither '<' nor '=', s is a string, pans is [0, 1] if s is '<', [0, 1] if s is '=', and an empty list if s is neither '<' nor '=', mak is 1 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<', mak2 is n-2 if s is '<', and remains unchanged if s is not '<'.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The output buffer now contains the string '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 1 if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<'), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is `n-2` if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<'), followed by the value of `i` (which is 1), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is `n-2` if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<'). The value of `s` is now a string that was input by the user. The value of `pans` is [0, 1] if `s` is '<', [0, 1] if `s` is '=', and an empty list if `s` is neither '<' nor '='. The value of `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<'. The value of `mak2` is `n-2` if `s` is '<', and remains unchanged if `s` is not '<'.
