Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, `s` is either '<', '>' or '=', `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` or 0 if `s` is '<', and the loop variable `_` is 1, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer is empty, so there is no output to flush. However, the output `? 0 0 1 1` is still printed. The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.
