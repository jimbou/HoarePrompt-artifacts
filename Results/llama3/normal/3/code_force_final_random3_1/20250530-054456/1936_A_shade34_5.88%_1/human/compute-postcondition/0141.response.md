The code prints a string containing a '?' followed by the value of `pans[mak]` (which is either 0 or 2 depending on the value of `s`), followed by the value of `pans[mak]` (which is either 0 or 2 depending on the value of `s`), followed by the value of `pans[i]` (which is the 3rd element of the `pans` list), followed by the value of `pans[i]` (which is the 3rd element of the `pans` list).
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[mak] is either 0 or 2 depending on the value of s, and pans[i] is the 3rd element of the pans list)**
