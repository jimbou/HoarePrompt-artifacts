Based on the initial state, let's break down the values of the variables and objects that will be printed:

* `?` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak` is either 1 or 0, depending on the input. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise it is 0. Since the input is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe it as "either 1 or 0, depending on the input".
* `i` is 2, which is a known explicit value.

Now, let's combine these values to describe the output:

Output: **? either 1 or 0, depending on the input, either 1 or 0, depending on the input, 2, 2**
