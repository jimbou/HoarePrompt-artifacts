Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `pans` is a list containing 0, the output buffer is empty, the current value of `s` is '=', the output buffer has been flushed `n` times, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`), followed by the value of `i` (which is `n-1`), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2`).**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
