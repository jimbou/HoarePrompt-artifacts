The `print` statement will print a string containing several values from the `pans` list.

The values printed are:
- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this will print the first element of the `pans` list, which is 0.
- `pans[mak]`: This is the same as the previous one, so it will also print 0.
- `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 1, this will print the second element of the `pans` list, which is 1.
- `pans[i]`: This is the same as the previous one, so it will also print 1.

The string is prefixed with '?' and the values are separated by spaces.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
