Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, the output buffer is empty, s is a string. If s is '<', then pans is [0], mak is 0, and mak2 is n-1. If s is '=', then pans is [0]. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is an empty list. In all cases, mak and mak2 remain unchanged if s is not '<'.***
