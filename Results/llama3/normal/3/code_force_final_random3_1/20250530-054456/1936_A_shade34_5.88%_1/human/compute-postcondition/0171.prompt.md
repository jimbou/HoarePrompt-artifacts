Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value, i is n-1, pans is a list containing all numbers from 0 to n-1, the output buffer is empty, s is either '<', '>' or '=', mak is 0, mak2 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-2 or 0 if s is '<', and the loop variable _ is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, if `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 0, otherwise `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged, and the loop variable `_` is 1, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, `mak2` is 0, and the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [2] [2] [2] [2]. Otherwise, `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged, and the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3, the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [3] [3] [3] [3] and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, the output buffer is updated with ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] or ? [2] [2] [2] [2] depending on the input, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [3] [3] and the output buffer is flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
