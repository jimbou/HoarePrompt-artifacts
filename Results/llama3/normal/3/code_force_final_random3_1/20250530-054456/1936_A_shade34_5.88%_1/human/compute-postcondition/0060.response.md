The code prints a string that starts with '?', followed by two identical elements from the `pans` list at index `mak`, and then two identical elements from the `pans` list at index `i`. 

Since `mak` is 0 or 1, the two identical elements from the `pans` list at index `mak` will be either 0 or 1 (because `pans` contains all values from 0 to n-1). 

Since `i` is 2, the two identical elements from the `pans` list at index `i` will be 2 (because `pans` contains all values from 0 to n-1 and `n` is at least 1).

Output: **? [0 or 1] [0 or 1] 2 2**
