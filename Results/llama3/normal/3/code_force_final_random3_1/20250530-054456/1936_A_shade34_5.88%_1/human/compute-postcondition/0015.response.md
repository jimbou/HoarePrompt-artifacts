The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `? 0 0 1 1` is displayed on the console, and stdin contains at least one fewer input than initially, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input from stdin is '<', then `mak` is 2 and "? 1 1 2 2" is printed. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and "? 0 0 2 2" is printed.**
