Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer equal to the first input, l is a list of integers equal to the second input, n is greater than x + 1, i is equal to x + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases. If the loop completed all iterations without breaking, then flag is not defined. Otherwise, flag is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `n` is greater than `x` + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True, the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `n` is greater than `x` + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases, `flag` is True, the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `n` is greater than `x` + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases, `flag` is True, and the number 2 is being printed if the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1. Otherwise, the program continues executing without printing 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
