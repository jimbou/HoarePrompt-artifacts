The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is at least 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is at least 2, `x` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers**
