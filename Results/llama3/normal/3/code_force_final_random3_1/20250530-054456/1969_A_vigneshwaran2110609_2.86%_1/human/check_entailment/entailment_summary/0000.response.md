Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`. It then checks if there exists a pair of friends `i` and `j` such that `l[i] == j` and `l[j] == i`. If such a pair is found, it means that inviting these two friends will result in at least 2 friends coming to the party, so it prints 2.

If no such pair is found, it means that inviting any two friends will not result in at least 2 friends coming to the party. In this case, the program prints 3, which is the minimum number of invitations needed to guarantee that at least 2 friends will come to the party.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2, in which case inviting both friends will result in both friends coming to the party.

Correctness: **True**
