Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains the rest of the test cases. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
