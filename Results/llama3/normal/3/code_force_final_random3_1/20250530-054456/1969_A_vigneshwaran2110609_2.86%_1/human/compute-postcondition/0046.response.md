Output State: **i is greater than x, x is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `i` is initially `x + 1`, after this line, `i` becomes greater than `x`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`. Since stdin is empty after this line, it is not included in the output state. The value of `n` is not affected by the code and remains greater than `x + 1`.
