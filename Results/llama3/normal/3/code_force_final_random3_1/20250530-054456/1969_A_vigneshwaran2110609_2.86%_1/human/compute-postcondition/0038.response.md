The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `n` is greater than `x` + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases, `flag` is True, the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1**
