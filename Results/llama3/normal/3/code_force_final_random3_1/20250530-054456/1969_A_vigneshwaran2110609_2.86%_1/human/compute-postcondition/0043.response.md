Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `n` is greater than `x` + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases, `flag` is True, and the number 2 is being printed if the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1. Otherwise, the program continues executing without printing 2.***
