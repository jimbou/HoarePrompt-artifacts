Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `n` is greater than `x` + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases, `flag` is True, the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
