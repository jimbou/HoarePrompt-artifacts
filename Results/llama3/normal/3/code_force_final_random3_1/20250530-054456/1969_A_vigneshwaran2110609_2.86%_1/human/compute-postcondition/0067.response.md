Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, stdin is empty, and `flag` is True if `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1` for any `i` in the range of `x`, otherwise `flag` is not defined.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `i` has reached the value of `n`, `x` and `l` retain their last values, and the standard input is empty. The value of `flag` depends on whether the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met during the last iteration of the loop. If it was met, `flag` is True; otherwise, `flag` is not defined.
