To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is greater than 0. Since `i` is greater than `x`, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 1. Additionally, `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is at least 1, `x` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty**
