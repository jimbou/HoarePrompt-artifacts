Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `n` is greater than `x` + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True, the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number 2 is being printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
