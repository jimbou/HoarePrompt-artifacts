Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains the rest of the test cases and the rest of the input for the current test case
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains the rest of the test cases. If the loop completed all iterations without breaking, then `flag` is not defined. Otherwise, `flag` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `x`, `flag` is True if `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1` for any `i` in the range of `x`, and the number 2 is being printed if `flag` is True. Otherwise, the number 3 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is equal to x, x is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin is empty, flag is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
