Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `n` is greater than `x` + 1, stdin contains the rest of the test cases, `flag` is True, the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the number 2 is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `x`, `i`, `l`, `n`, `flag` and `l[l[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the rest of the test cases. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number 2 is still being printed.
