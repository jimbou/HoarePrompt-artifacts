According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases and the rest of the input for the current test case**
