Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result of each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer x and a list of x distinct integers, then checks if any integer in the list is equal to the integer at the index specified by the integer minus one. If such a pair is found, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but modifies the stdin by consuming the input.**
