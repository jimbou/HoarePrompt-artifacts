Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, stdin contains the rest of the test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` do not change. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The stdin still contains the rest of the test cases. The number 2 is still being printed.
