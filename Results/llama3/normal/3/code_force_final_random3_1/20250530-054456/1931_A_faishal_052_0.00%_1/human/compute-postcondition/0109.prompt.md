Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains one input: a list of integers `n` (3 <= n <= 78) of length `cases`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex <= 26:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        else:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    for k in range(3):
        print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, 26, or lex, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1, 1, lex]. If lex is 26, then arr is [1, 26, 26]. If lex is greater than 26 and less than 52, then arr is [1, 26, lex] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26, 26] if lex was 26. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k] is being printed. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[1] is being printed, and the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k] is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is a sorted list containing either 1 or 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25 and arr contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and arr contains 26. and this is printed: the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 which is the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + 1 if lex is less than or equal to 25, or the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + 26 if lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
