Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 2, arr has an additional element 26, lex is reduced by 26**

In this output state, the initial values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `arr` has been appended with the value 26, increasing its length by one. The variable `lex` has been decremented by 26, resulting in a new value that is 26 less than its original value.
