Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 1, k is 3, lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is [1, 26], and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, but its exact value is still not specified. The list `arr` has been appended with the value 26, resulting in `[1, 26]`. All other variables, including `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, remain unchanged. The characters being printed are still represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex, but the value of `lex` has been modified.
