Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is [1, 1, 26] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1, 26] if lex was 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

The code first appends 26 to the list `arr`, changing its value from either [1, 1] or [26, 1] to [1, 1, 26] or [26, 1, 26], respectively. Then, it decrements the value of `lex` by 26. Since `lex` was either less than or equal to 25 or exactly 26, after the decrement, `lex` will be less than or equal to 25. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
