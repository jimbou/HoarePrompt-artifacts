Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is a sorted list containing either 1 or 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25 and arr contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and arr contains 26.**

The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr` and then sorts the list in ascending order. The value of `lex` is an integer, and its value determines whether `arr` contains 1 or 26. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains 1, and if `lex` is larger than 25 and less than 52, `arr` contains 26. The sorting operation does not change the values of the elements in `arr`, but it rearranges them in ascending order. The other variables, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, are not affected by the code.
