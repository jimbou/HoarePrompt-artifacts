Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is [1, 1, 26] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1, 26] if lex was 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. This means that if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` becomes [1, 1, 26], and if `lex` was 26, `arr` becomes [26, 1, 26]. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, making it less than or equal to 25. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
