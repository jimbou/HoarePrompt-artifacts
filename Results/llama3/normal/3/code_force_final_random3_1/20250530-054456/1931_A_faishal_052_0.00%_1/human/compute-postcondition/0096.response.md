Postcondition: **The program executes the if part if lex is less than or equal to 26, and the else part otherwise. In both cases, cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, and arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and also either 1 or 26. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex (or 96 + lex - 1 in the if part) are being printed. The value of lex (or lex - 1 in the if part) determines the contents of arr: if it is less than or equal to 25, arr contains 1; if it is larger than 25 and less than 52, arr contains 26.**
