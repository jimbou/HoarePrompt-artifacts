To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and the range `2`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range `2`. If the range is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `j` is the loop variable, its initial value should be the starting point of the range, which is 0.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**
