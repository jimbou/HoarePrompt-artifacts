To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for k in range(3):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is at least 0 and less than 3. To execute the loop again, `k` must be incremented by 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, 26, or `lex`, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, `k` is at least 1 and less than 3, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is being printed**

Note that only the state of `k` has been adjusted, as it is the only variable in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
