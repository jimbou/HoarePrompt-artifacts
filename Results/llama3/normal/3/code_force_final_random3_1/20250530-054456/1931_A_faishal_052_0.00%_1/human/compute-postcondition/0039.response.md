According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range `2`. If the range is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 1, which is less than 2, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0. The range `2` is already greater than 0, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed**
