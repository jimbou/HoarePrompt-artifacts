The code prints a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since `k` is at least 0 and less than 3, it can take the values 0, 1, or 2. The list `arr` contains either the integer 1, 26, or `lex`, where `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26.

When `k` is 0, `arr[k]` will be the first element of the list `arr`, which can be 1, 26, or `lex`. Adding 96 to this value and converting it to a character using the `chr` function will result in a character corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 (for `lex` = 1), 122 (for `lex` = 26), or a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `lex + 96` (for `lex`).

When `k` is 1, `arr[k]` will be the second element of the list `arr`, which can also be 1, 26, or `lex`. Adding 96 to this value and converting it to a character using the `chr` function will result in a character corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 (for `lex` = 1), 122 (for `lex` = 26), or a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `lex + 96` (for `lex`).

When `k` is 2, `arr[k]` will be the third element of the list `arr`, which can also be 1, 26, or `lex`. Adding 96 to this value and converting it to a character using the `chr` function will result in a character corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 (for `lex` = 1), 122 (for `lex` = 26), or a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `lex + 96` (for `lex`).

Since the exact value of `lex` is not provided, we can't determine the exact character that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`.

Output: **a character corresponding to the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 (where k is at least 0 and less than 3, and arr[k] is either 1, 26, or lex)**
