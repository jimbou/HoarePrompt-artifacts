Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1, 1, lex]. If lex is 26, then arr is [1, 26, 26]. If lex is greater than 26 and less than 52, then arr is [1, 26, lex] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26, 26] if lex was 26.**

The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr` and then sorts the list in ascending order. The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is initially `[1, 1]`. If `lex` is 26, `arr` is initially `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is initially `[1, 26]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or `[26, 26]` if `lex` was 26. After appending `lex` to `arr`, the list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed.
