To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.


The loop head is `for k in range(3):`. This means that the only variable that can be adjusted is `k`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` becomes 2.


The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head, so their states remain the same.


State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1, 1, lex]. If lex is 26, then arr is [1, 26, 26]. If lex is greater than 26 and less than 52, then arr is [1, 26, lex] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26, 26] if lex was 26. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k] is being printed. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[1] is being printed.**
