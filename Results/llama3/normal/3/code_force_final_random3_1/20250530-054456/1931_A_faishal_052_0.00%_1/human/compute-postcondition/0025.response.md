Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr is a list containing either the integer 1 or 26, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `cases` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `j` is now 1 (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), `arr` contains either 1 or 26 (or a combination of both) depending on the initial value of `lex`, and `lex` is reduced to a value between 1 and 25 (inclusive).
