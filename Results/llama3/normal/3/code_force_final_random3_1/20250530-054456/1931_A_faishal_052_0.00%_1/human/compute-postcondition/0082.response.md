Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer larger than 26 and less than 52, arr is a list containing 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been updated to be less than 52, as it was decreased by 26 in the second line of the code. The list `arr` now contains the integer 26, which was appended in the first line of the code. All other variables remain unchanged, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed.
