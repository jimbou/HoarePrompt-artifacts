Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, 26, or lex, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26.**

The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr` and then sorts the list in ascending order. Since `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, and `arr` originally contained either 1 or 26, the sorted list will have `lex` in its appropriate position, maintaining the sorted order. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
