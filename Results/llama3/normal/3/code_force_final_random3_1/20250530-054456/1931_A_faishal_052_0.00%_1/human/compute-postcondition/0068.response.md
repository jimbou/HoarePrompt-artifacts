Output: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 1, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1, 1, lex]. If lex is 26, then arr is [1, 26, 26]. If lex is greater than 26 and less than 52, then arr is [1, 26, lex] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26, 26] if lex was 26. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k] is being printed. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[1] is being printed.**
