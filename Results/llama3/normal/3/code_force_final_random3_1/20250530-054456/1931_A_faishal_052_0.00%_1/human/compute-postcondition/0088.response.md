Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 1, k is 3, arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25 and arr contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and arr contains 26.**

The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The value of `lex` is either less than or equal to 25 or larger than 25 and less than 52. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains 1. If `lex` is larger than 25 and less than 52, `arr` contains 26. The value of `lex` is updated by subtracting 26, but its range remains the same. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed.
