The only variable in the loop head is variable `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 0 and less than 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, 26, or `lex`, and `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `k` is at least 0 and less than 3.
State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, 26, or `lex`, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, `k` is at least 0 and less than 3**
