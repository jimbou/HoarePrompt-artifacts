The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since `k` is at least 1 and less than 3, `k` can be either 1 or 2. Since `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, 26, or `lex`, and `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, the possible values of `arr[k]` are 1, 26, or `lex`. Adding 96 to these values and converting them to characters using the `chr` function will result in the characters 'a', '{', or a character between 'b' and 'z' (inclusive), respectively.

Output: **a character between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive), '{', or 'a'**
