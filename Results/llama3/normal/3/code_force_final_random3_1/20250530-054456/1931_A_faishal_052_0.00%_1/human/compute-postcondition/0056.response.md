Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, lex is one less than its original value, and arr is [1, 1, 1] if lex is less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1, 1] if lex is 26. If lex is greater than 26, lex is less than or equal to 25, and arr is [1, 26, 1]. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, and the list `arr` has an additional element appended to it, which is 1. The condition regarding the ASCII values and printing of characters remains the same as in the initial state.
