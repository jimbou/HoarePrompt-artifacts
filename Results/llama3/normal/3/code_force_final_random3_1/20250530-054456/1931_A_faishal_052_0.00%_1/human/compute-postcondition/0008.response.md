Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list containing the integer 26, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, j is 0, range is at least 1**

In this final state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The list `arr` now contains the integer 26, which was appended to it by the first line of the code. The value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, making it an integer greater than 0 but less than 26. The value of `j` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The range remains at least 1, as it is not affected by the code.
