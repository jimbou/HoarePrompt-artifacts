The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since `k` is less than 3, it can be either 0, 1, or 2. The value of `arr[k]` depends on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains 1, so `arr[k]` will be 1. If `lex` is larger than 25 and less than 52, `arr` contains 26, so `arr[k]` will be 26.

Since `arr[k]` can be either 1 or 26, the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` will be either 97 (for `arr[k] = 1`) or 122 (for `arr[k] = 26`). The characters represented by these ASCII values are 'a' and 'z', respectively.

Therefore, the code will print either 'a' or 'z', depending on the value of `lex`.

Output: **'a' or 'z' (where 'a' is printed if lex is less than or equal to 25 and 'z' is printed if lex is larger than 25 and less than 52)**
