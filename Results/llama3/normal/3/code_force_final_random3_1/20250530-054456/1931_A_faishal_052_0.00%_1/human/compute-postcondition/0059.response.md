Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 1, 26] and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If `lex` is 26, `arr` is [26, 1, 26] and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is [1, 1, 26] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1, 26] if `lex` was 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.***
