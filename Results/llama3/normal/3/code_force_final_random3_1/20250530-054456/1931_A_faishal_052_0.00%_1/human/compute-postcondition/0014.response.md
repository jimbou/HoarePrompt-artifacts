Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is [1, 1] or [26, 1], j is 1, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26 or greater than 25 but less than 52 or greater than 51.**

The code modifies the initial state by appending 1 to the list `arr` and decrementing the value of `lex` by 1. The value of `lex` is reduced by 1, but its range remains the same, i.e., greater than 0 but less than 26, greater than 25 but less than 52, or greater than 51. The list `arr` is updated to either [1, 1] or [26, 1], depending on its initial value. All other variables, including `cases`, `i`, and `j`, remain unchanged.
