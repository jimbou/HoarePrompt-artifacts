Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of an integer. For each case, it generates a sorted list of three integers, either 1 or 26, and a remaining value, then prints the corresponding lowercase letters represented by the ASCII values of 96 plus these integers. The function processes all test cases and prints the resulting characters for each case.**
