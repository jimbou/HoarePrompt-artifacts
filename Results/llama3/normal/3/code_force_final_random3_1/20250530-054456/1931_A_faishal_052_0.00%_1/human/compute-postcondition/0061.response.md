Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1, 1]. If lex is 26, then arr is [26, 1]. If lex is greater than 26 and less than 52, then arr is [1, 26] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26] if lex was 26.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the program is as follows: the variable `cases` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, `j` has reached 2 (the end of the loop), and `k` remains 3. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed. The value of `arr` depends on the initial value of `lex`. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 1]. If `lex` was 26, `arr` is [26, 1]. If `lex` was greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26] if `lex` was 26.
