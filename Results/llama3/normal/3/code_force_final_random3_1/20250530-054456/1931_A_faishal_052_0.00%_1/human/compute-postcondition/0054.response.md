Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is one less than its original value, and `arr` is [1, 1] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1] if `lex` is 26. Otherwise, `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 26], and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.***
