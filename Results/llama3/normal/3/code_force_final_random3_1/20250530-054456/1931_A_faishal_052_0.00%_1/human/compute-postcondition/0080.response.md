Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer between 0 and 26, arr is a list containing the integer 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

The code first appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making it a list containing the integer 26. Then, it subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, making it an integer between 0 and 26. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed.
