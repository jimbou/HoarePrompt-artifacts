Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is a sorted list containing either 1 or 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25 and arr contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and arr contains 26. and this is printed: the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 which is the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + 1 if lex is less than or equal to 25, or the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + 26 if lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of k is now 3, indicating that the loop has completed all 3 iterations. The state of the other variables, including cases, i, j, lex, and arr, remains unchanged. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed for the third time.
