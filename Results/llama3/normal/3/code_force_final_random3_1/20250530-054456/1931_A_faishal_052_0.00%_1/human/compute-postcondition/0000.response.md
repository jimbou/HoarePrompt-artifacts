Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains one input: a list of integers `n` (3 <= n <= 78) of length `cases`**

In this output state, the variable `cases` has been assigned the value of the first input integer from stdin, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains a list of integers `n` of length `cases`, where each `n` is between 3 and 78.
