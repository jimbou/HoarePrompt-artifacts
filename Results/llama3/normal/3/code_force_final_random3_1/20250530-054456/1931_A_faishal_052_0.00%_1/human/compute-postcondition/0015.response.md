Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is [1, 26] or [26, 26], j is 1, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26.**

The code appends 26 to the list `arr` and then subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. Since `arr` was either [1] or [26] initially, it becomes [1, 26] or [26, 26] respectively. The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, but its range is not affected, so it remains an integer greater than 0 but less than 26. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not modified by the code.
