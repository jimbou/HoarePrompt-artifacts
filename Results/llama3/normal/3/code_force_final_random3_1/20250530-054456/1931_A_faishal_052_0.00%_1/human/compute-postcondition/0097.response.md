Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is a list containing either 1 or 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25 and arr contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and arr contains 26.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of j is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The value of lex has been updated based on the conditions in the loop body, and the list arr contains either 1 or 26 depending on the value of lex. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed. The state of the other variables, such as cases, i, and k, remains unchanged.
