The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1.
State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25 and `arr` contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and `arr` contains 26.**
