Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 1, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1]. If lex is 26, then arr is [26].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is one less than its original value, and `arr` is [1, 1] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1] if `lex` is 26. Otherwise, `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 26], and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 1, 1] and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If `lex` is 26, `arr` is [26, 1, 1] and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is [1, 26, 1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1, 26] if `lex` was 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
