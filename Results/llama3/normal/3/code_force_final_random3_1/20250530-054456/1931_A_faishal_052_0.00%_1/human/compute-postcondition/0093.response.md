Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and also either 1 or 26 and 26, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 24 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

The code appends 26 to the list `arr`, which now contains either 1 or 26 and also either 1 or 26 and 26. The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, making it an integer with a value less than or equal to 24. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
