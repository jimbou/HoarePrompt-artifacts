Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, 26, or lex, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., 3 times), the values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop variable `k` has reached its final value of 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. Additionally, the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` have been printed, which are either 'a', 'b', or a combination of these characters, depending on the values in the `arr` list.
