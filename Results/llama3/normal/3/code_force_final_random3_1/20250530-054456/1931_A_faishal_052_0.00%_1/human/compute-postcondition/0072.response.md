Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1, 1, lex]. If lex is 26, then arr is [1, 26, 26]. If lex is greater than 26 and less than 52, then arr is [1, 26, lex] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26, 26] if lex was 26. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k] is being printed. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[1] is being printed, and the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k] is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed, and the array `arr` remains the same as before. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + arr[k] and 96 + arr[1] are still being printed, indicating that the loop has executed all its iterations and printed the corresponding characters.
