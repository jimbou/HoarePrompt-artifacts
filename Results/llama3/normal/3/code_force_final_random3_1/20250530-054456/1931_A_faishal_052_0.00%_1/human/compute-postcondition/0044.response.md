Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, arr is [26], k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. The current value of lex is less than 26.**

Explanation:
The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making it `[26]`. The second line subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`, making it less than 26. No other variables are affected.
