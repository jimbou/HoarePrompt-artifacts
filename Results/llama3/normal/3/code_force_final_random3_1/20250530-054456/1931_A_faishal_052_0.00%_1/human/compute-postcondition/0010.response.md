The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making it a list containing a single element, 26. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which is initially greater than 52. This means that `lex` will now be greater than 26.

Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is [26], lex is greater than 26, j is 0**
