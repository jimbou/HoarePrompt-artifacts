Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `arr` is a sorted list containing either 1 or 26.
* `k` is 2, which means we are accessing the third element of the list `arr` (since indexing starts at 0).
* The expression `arr[k] + 96` is being passed to the `chr` function, which converts an ASCII value to a character.
* If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains 1, so `arr[k] + 96` would be `1 + 96 = 97`, which is the ASCII value of the character 'a'.
* If `lex` is larger than 25 and less than 52, `arr` contains 26, so `arr[k] + 96` would be `26 + 96 = 122`, which is the ASCII value of the character 'z'.

Since the value of `lex` is not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact character that will be printed. However, based on the precondition, we can describe the output as:

Output: **the character 'a' if lex is less than or equal to 25, or the character 'z' if lex is larger than 25 and less than 52**
