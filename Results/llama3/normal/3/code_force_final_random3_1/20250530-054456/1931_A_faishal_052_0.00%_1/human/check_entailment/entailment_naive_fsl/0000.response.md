Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs "aab", but the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded is actually "baa". 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the input is less than 52. In this case, the program subtracts 26 from the input, but it should subtract the smallest possible value that would result in a valid three-letter word. 

For example, when the input is 6, the program subtracts 26, resulting in -20, which is not a valid value. Instead, the program should subtract 1, resulting in 5, and then append 1 to the array, resulting in [1, 1, 4]. This would correctly output "baa". 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
