To determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 2.
   - The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. This implies that the characters 'a', 'z', and a character determined by `lex` are being printed.
   - The value of `lex` determines the array `arr`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 1, lex]. If `lex` is 26, `arr` is [1, 26, 26]. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is [1, 26, lex] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26, 26] if `lex` was 26.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is printing the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k], where k is 2.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - Since `k` is 2, we are interested in the third element of the array `arr`.
   - The value of `lex` is crucial in determining the third element of `arr`. However, the exact value of `lex` is not provided, making it impossible to compute the exact numerical value of the third element of `arr`.
   - Given the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 plus the third element of the array `arr`, which depends on the value of `lex`.

4. **Output Description**:
   - The output will be the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 plus the third element of the array `arr`, which is determined by the value of `lex`.

Output: **the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 plus the third element of the array arr, which is determined by the value of lex**
