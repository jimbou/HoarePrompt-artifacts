According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1.
State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1]. If lex is 26, then arr is [26]**
