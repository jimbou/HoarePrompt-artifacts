Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and also either 1 or 26, and 1, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex - 1 are being printed. If lex - 1 is less than or equal to 25, lex - 1 is an integer with a value less than or equal to 24 and arr contains 1. If lex - 1 is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex - 1 is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and arr contains 26. If lex - 1 is less than or equal to 26, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.**

The code first appends 1 to the list `arr`, making it contain either 1 or 26, and also either 1 or 26, and 1. Then, it decrements the value of `lex` by 1. This affects the conditions related to `lex` in the initial state. If `lex - 1` is less than or equal to 25, `lex - 1` is an integer with a value less than or equal to 24 and `arr` contains 1. If `lex - 1` is larger than 25 and less than 52, `lex - 1` is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and `arr` contains 26. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex - 1 are being printed. The rest of the variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
