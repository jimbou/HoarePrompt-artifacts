Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing 1, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, resulting in a value less than or equal to 25. The list `arr` now contains the integer 1, which was appended by the first line of the code. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values.
