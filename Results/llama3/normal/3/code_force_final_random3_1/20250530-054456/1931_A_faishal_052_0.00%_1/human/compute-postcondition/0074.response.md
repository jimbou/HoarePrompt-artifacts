Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is an empty list, stdin contains no input, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line initializes an empty list called `arr`. The second line reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `lex`. Since `lex` is now an integer, the conditions in the initial state that depend on the value of `lex` are no longer relevant. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are still being printed, as the code does not modify this behavior. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The standard input is now empty, as the `input()` function has consumed the input.
