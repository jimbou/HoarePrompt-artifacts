Output State: **cases is 0, i is equal to the initial value of cases, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is a sorted list containing either 1 or 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25 and arr contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and arr contains 26.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all the iterations specified by the initial value of `cases`. The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `cases`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The inner loop counters `j` and `k` have reached their maximum values, indicating that the inner loops have also completed all their iterations. The list `arr` contains the sorted values of either 1 or 26, depending on the value of `lex`. The characters represented by the ASCII values of `96 + 1`, `96 + 26`, and `96 + lex` are being printed, which corresponds to the characters 'a', 'z', and the character represented by the ASCII value of `lex + 96`, respectively. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, it means that the input value was less than or equal to 25, and `arr` contains the value 1. If `lex` is larger than 25 and less than 52, it means that the input value was larger than 25 and less than 52, and `arr` contains the value 26.
