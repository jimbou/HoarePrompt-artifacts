The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `cases` must be greater than 2.
State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, then arr is [1, 1, lex]. If lex is 26, then arr is [1, 26, 26]. If lex is greater than 26 and less than 52, then arr is [1, 26, lex] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26, 26] if lex was 26. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k] is being printed. The character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[1] is being printed, and the character represented by the ASCII value of 96 + arr[k] is being printed.**
