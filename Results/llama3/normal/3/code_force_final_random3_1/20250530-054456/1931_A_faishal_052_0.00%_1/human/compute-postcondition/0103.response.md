The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since `k` is 1 and `arr` is a sorted list containing either 1 or 26, the value of `arr[k]` is either 1 or 26.

If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains 1, so `arr[k]` is 1. The ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is 97, which represents the character 'a'.

If `lex` is larger than 25 and less than 52, `arr` contains 26, so `arr[k]` is 26. The ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is 122, which represents the character 'z'.

Since `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0, these variables do not affect the output.

Output: **a (if lex is less than or equal to 25) or z (if lex is larger than 25 and less than 52)**
