To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the Python code snippet.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 1.
   - The characters represented by the ASCII values of `96 + 1`, `96 + 26`, and `96 + lex` are being printed. This implies that the characters 'a' (97 in ASCII), 'z' (122 in ASCII), and a character determined by `lex` are involved.
   - The value of `lex` determines the contents of `arr`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`. If `lex` is 26, `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, the value of `arr` depends on whether `lex` was less than or equal to 25 or if it was 26, resulting in either `[1, 26, lex]` or `[26, 26, 26]`, respectively.
   - The character represented by the ASCII value of `96 + arr[k]` is being printed. Given that `k` is 1, we're interested in the second element of `arr` (`arr[1]`).

2. **Determining the Value of `arr[k]`**:
   - Since `k` is 1, we look at the second element of `arr`, which is `arr[1]`.
   - Based on the initial state, if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr[1]` is 1. If `lex` is 26, `arr[1]` is 26. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr[1]` is 26 regardless of the previous value of `lex`.

3. **Calculating the ASCII Character**:
   - The character to be printed is determined by `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - If `arr[1]` is 1, the ASCII value is `1 + 96 = 97`, which corresponds to 'a'.
   - If `arr[1]` is 26, the ASCII value is `26 + 96 = 122`, which corresponds to 'z'.

Given the initial state and the logic applied to determine the value of `arr[k]`, the output will be either 'a' or 'z', depending on the value of `lex`. However, since the exact value of `lex` is not provided, we can't definitively say which character will be printed. But based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **'a' if lex is less than or equal to 25, 'z' if lex is 26 or greater than 26 and less than 52**
