According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If the range of `j` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, and `lex` is an integer, but these do not ensure that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be at least 0 and the range to be at least 1.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, `j` is 0, range is at least 1**
