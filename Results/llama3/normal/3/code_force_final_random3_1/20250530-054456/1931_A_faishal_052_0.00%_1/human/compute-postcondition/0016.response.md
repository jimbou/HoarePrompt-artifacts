Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is [1, 26] if lex was less than or equal to 25, arr is [26, 26] if lex was greater than 25 but less than 52, arr is [26, 26] if lex was greater than or equal to 52, j is 1, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26 if lex was greater than 25 but less than 52, lex is greater than 0 but less than 26 if lex was greater than or equal to 52**

The code appends 26 to the list `arr` and subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` becomes [1, 26] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` was greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` becomes [26, 26] and `lex` becomes an integer greater than 0 but less than 26. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` becomes [26, 26] and `lex` becomes greater than 0 but less than 26. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
