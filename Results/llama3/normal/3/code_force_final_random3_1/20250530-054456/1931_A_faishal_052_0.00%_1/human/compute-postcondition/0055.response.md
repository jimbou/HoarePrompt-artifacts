The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, but the loop will not execute again because `j` is not less than 2. However, we can still adjust the state to reflect that the loop will not execute again.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is one less than its original value, and `arr` is [1, 1] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1] if `lex` is 26. Otherwise, `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1, 26], and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**
