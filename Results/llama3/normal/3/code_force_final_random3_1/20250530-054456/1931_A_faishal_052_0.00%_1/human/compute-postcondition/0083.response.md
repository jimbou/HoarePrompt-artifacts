Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is between 0 and 26, lex is an integer between 0 and 26. If lex is larger than 26 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 26 and less than 52.***
