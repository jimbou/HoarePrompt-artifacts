Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, arr is [26], lex is an integer greater than 0 and less than 26, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making `arr` equal to [26]. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 26. Since `lex` is initially greater than 26, the new value of `lex` will be greater than 0 and less than 26. The other variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
