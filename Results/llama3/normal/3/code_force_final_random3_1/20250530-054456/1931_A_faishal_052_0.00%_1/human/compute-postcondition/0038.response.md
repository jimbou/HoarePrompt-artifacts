Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 1, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 1, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed**

The code first clears the list `arr`, making it empty. Then, it reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `lex`. The value of `lex` is now an integer greater than 0 but less than 26. The characters represented by the ASCII values of `96 + 1`, `96 + 26`, and `96 + lex` are being printed. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
