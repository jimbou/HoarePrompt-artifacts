Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 1, k is 3, lex is one less than its original value, and arr is [1, 1] if lex is less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1] if lex is 26.**

The code appends 1 to the list arr, which originally contained either [1] if lex was less than or equal to 25, or [26] if lex was 26. As a result, arr becomes [1, 1] in the first case, or [26, 1] in the second case. The second line of the code decrements the value of lex by 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
