Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is an empty list, stdin contains no input, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 25 and `arr` contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and `arr` contains 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26 and also either 1 or 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex are being printed. If lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is an integer with a value less than or equal to 24 and arr contains 1. If lex is larger than 25 and less than 52, lex is an integer larger than 25 and less than 52 and arr contains 26. If lex is less than or equal to 26, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program executes the if part if lex is less than or equal to 26, and the else part otherwise. In both cases, cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, and arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and also either 1 or 26. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96 + 2, 96 + 26, and 96 + lex (or 96 + lex - 1 in the if part) are being printed. The value of lex (or lex - 1 in the if part) determines the contents of arr: if it is less than or equal to 25, arr contains 1; if it is larger than 25 and less than 52, arr contains 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
