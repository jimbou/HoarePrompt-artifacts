The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1.
State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or 26, `j` is 1, range is at least 1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is [1]. If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is greater than 26.**
