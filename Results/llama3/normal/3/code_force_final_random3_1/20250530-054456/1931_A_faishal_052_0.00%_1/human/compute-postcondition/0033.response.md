The only variable in the loop head is variable `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1 and less than 3. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1. So, `k` is at least 2 and less than 3.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list containing either the integer 1, 26, or `lex`, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, `k` is at least 2 and less than 3, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is being printed, the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` which is either 'a' or 'b' is being printed**
