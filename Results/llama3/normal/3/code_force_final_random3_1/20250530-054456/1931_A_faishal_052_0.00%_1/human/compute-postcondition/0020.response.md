Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 2, arr has one more element than before (1), lex is one less than its previous value.**

The code block modifies the state of the program by appending the value 1 to the list `arr`, and decrementing the value of `lex` by 1. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
