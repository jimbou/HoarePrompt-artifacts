Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the number of problems in the bank (n) is less than the number of upcoming rounds (m). In this case, the program should output the difference between m and the number of unique difficulty levels in the bank, but instead, it outputs 0.

For example, if the input is:

3
5 7
ABCDE

The program should output 2, because Vlad needs to come up with 2 more problems of difficulty levels 'F' and 'G' to hold 7 rounds. However, the program outputs 0, which is incorrect.

The correct program should count the number of unique difficulty levels in the bank and then subtract this number from m to get the minimum number of problems that need to be come up with.
