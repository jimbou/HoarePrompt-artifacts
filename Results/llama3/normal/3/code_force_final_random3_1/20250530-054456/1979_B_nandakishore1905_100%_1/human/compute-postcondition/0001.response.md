Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The values of `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the first line of input in stdin, which now contains one less line of input. The value of `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, resulting in a non-negative integer.
