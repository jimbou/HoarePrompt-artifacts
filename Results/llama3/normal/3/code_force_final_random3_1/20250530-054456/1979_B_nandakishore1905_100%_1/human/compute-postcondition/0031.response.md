The only variable in the loop head is variable f, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable f.  If f & f - 1 != 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, f is k minus 2 to the power of p-1, So for the loop to be executed one more time f & f - 1 must not be equal to 0. That means f must not be a power of 2. That means k must not be equal to 2 to the power of p-1. That means the absolute difference between n and m must not be a power of 2. That means n and m must not be such that their absolute difference is a power of 2. That means n and m must be such that their absolute difference is not a power of 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **i is 1, n and m must be such that their absolute difference is not a power of 2, k is the absolute difference between n and m, l is a string of binary digits representing f, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1, f is k minus 2 to the power of p-1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines.**
