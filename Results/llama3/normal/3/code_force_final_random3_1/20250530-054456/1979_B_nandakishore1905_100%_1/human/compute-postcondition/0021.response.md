Postcondition: ***i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If k is a power of 2, the value of k is printed. If k is not a power of 2, then if k is odd, 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of k which is a power of 2 is printed.***
