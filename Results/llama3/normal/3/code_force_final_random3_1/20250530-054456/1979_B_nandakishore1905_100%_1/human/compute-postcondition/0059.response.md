Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two distinct non-negative integers x and y. It calculates the absolute difference k between x and y for each pair, and then prints k if it's a power of 2, 1 if k is odd, or the largest power of 2 less than k if k is even but not a power of 2. The function processes t pairs of integers and prints a corresponding value for each pair.**
