Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two distinct non-negative integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif k % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        f = k - q
        while f & f - 1 != 0:
            l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = f - q
        print(f)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If k is a power of 2, the value of k is printed. If k is not a power of 2, then if k is odd, 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of k which is a power of 2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines. If the absolute difference between n and m, which is k, is a power of 2, then k is printed. Otherwise, if k is odd, the number 1 is printed, and if k is even, the number 0 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line. If the absolute difference between n and m, which is k, is a power of 2, then k is printed. Otherwise, if k is odd, 1 is printed, and if k is even but not a power of 2, a power of 2 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
