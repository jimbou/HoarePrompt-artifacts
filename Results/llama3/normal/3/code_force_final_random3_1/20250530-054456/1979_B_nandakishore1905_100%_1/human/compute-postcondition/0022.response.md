To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `i`. Since `i` is 0, the value returned by `int(input())` must be at least 1.

The state of `n`, `m`, and `k` does not affect the loop's execution, so their values do not need to be adjusted.

The state of `stdin` is also not directly related to the loop's execution, but since one line of input has been consumed, the number of lines in `stdin` is reduced by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines.**
