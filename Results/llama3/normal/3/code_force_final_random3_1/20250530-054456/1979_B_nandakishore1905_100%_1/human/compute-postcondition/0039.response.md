Postcondition: ***i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines. If the absolute difference between n and m, which is k, is a power of 2, then k is printed. Otherwise, if k is odd, the number 1 is printed, and if k is even, the number 0 is printed.***
