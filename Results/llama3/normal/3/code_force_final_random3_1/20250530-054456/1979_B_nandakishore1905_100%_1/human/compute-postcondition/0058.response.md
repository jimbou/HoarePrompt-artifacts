Output State: **i is t-1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus t lines. If the absolute difference between n and m, which is k, is a power of 2, then k is printed. Otherwise, if k is odd, 1 is printed, and if k is even but not a power of 2, a power of 2 is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the initial value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `m` will still be integers, and `k` will be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The standard input `stdin` will have `t` fewer lines than initially. The loop will print the value of `k` if it is a power of 2, 1 if `k` is odd, or a power of 2 if `k` is even but not a power of 2.
