The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `input`. If `i` is less than the number of lines in `input`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `input` contains multiple lines of input minus three lines. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `input` must contain at least one more line.
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines.**
