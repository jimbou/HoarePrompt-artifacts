The code block consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Since stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines, after this line executes, stdin will contain multiple lines of input minus three lines. The second line calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`.

Output State: **i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines.**
