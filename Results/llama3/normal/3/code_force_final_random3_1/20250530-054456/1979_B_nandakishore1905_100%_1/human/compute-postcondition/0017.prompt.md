Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, l is a binary string representing k, p is the length of l, q is the value of the most significant bit in the binary representation of k, f is the result of subtracting the most significant bit from k, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line
Code of the loop:
while f & f - 1 != 0:
    l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
    p = len(l)
    q = 2 ** (p - 1)
    f = f - q


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer such that subtracting its most significant bit does not result in a power of 2, l is a binary string representing f, p is the length of l, q is the value of the most significant bit in the binary representation of f, f is the result of subtracting the most significant bit from k and must not be a power of 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer such that subtracting its most significant bit does not result in a power of 2, l is a binary string representing f, p is the length of l, q is the value of the most significant bit in the binary representation of f, f is the result of subtracting the most significant bit from k and must not be a power of 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer such that subtracting its most significant bit does not result in a power of 2, l is a binary string representing f, p is the length of l minus 1, q is the value of the most significant bit in the binary representation of f, f is the result of subtracting the most significant bit from k and is not a power of 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
