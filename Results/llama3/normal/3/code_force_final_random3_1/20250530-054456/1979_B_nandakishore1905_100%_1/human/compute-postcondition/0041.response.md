Output State: **i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is the absolute difference between n and m, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integer values obtained from the input, which replaces their previous values. The value of `k` is updated to the absolute difference between the new values of `n` and `m`. Stdin now contains one less line of input, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
