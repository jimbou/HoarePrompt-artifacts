Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, n is the number of elements in the third test case, x and y are the values from the third test case, arr is the third test case in the list and must have at least 3 elements, count is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) as a key and the number of times it appeared as its value plus one, num is the third element in the third test case, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, and current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y).**

The code block modifies the values of `r_x`, `r_y`, `count`, `current_key`, and `residue_map`. The first two lines calculate the remainders of `-num` divided by `x` and `num` divided by `y`, assigning them to `r_x` and `r_y`, respectively. The third line increments `count` by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` appeared before, which is retrieved from `residue_map`. The fourth line updates `current_key` to be the pair `(num % x, num % y)`. The fifth line increments the value associated with `current_key` in `residue_map` by 1.
