The only object in the loop head is variable  num and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 element, num is the first element in arr. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second element in the list.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is the number of elements in the first test case, x and y are the same as before, arr is the first test case in the list and must have at least 2 elements, count is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, num is the second element in arr, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y)**
