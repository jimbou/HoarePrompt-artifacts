Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, n is the number of elements in the second test case, x and y are the values from the second test case, arr is the second test case in the list and must have at least 3 elements, count is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before incremented by the value of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) incremented by 1, num is the third element in the second test case, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, and current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y).**

In this output state, the values of `r_x` and `r_y` have been updated based on the calculations involving `num`, `x`, and `y`. The `count` variable has been incremented by the value of `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map`, which reflects the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` appeared before. The `residue_map` dictionary has been updated with the pair `(num % x, num % y)` incremented by 1, reflecting the new occurrence of this pair. The `current_key` has been updated to the pair `(num % x, num % y)`, which is the same as the updated key in `residue_map`. All other variables remain unchanged.
