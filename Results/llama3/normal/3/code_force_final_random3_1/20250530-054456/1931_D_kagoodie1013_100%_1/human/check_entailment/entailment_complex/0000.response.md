Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary (residue_map) to store the residues of the numbers in the array modulo x and y. For each number in the array, it calculates the residues modulo x and y, and then checks if the pair of residues has been seen before. If it has, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

The program processes each test case independently and returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic for finding beautiful pairs. It uses a dictionary to efficiently store and look up the residues, and it correctly increments the count of beautiful pairs when it finds a pair of residues that has been seen before.

Correctness: **True**
