Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (t), the size of the array (n), Polycarp's favorite integers (x and y), and the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

2. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of test cases as input. Each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), Polycarp's favorite integers (x and y), and the elements of the array (arr).

3. Inside the `func_1` function, the program iterates over each test case. For each test case, it initializes a count variable to 0 and an empty dictionary `residue_map`.

4. The program then iterates over each element `num` in the array `arr`. For each element, it calculates the residue of `-num` modulo `x` (denoted as `r_x`) and the residue of `num` modulo `y` (denoted as `r_y`).

5. The program checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` is already present in the `residue_map` dictionary. If it is, it increments the count by the value associated with the tuple in the dictionary. This is because the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` represents a potential beautiful pair.

6. The program then updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count for the tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. This is because the tuple `(num % x, num % y)` represents the residue of `num` modulo `x` and `y`, respectively.

7. After iterating over all elements in the array, the program appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.

8. Finally, the program returns the `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues of the elements modulo `x` and `y`, which allows it to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs. The program also correctly handles the case where `x` or `y` is 1, as the problem statement guarantees that `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 1.
