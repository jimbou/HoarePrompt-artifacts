Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a. 

Here's why:

1. The program first reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list. Each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array `n`, Polycarp's favorite integers `x` and `y`, and the elements of the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. The program then defines a function `func_1` that takes the `test_cases` list as input. For each test case, it initializes a count variable to 0 and an empty dictionary `residue_map`.

3. The program then iterates over each number `num` in the array. For each number, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` with respect to `x` and `y` respectively.

4. It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` is already in the `residue_map`. If it is, it increments the count by the value associated with this pair in the `residue_map`. This is because for each pair `(r_x, r_y)`, there are `residue_map[(r_x, r_y)]` numbers that can form a beautiful pair with the current number.

5. The program then updates the `residue_map` by incrementing the count of the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

6. After iterating over all numbers in the array, the program appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.

7. Finally, the program returns the `results` list, which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
