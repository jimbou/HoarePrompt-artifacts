Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, n is the number of elements in the third test case, x and y are the values from the third test case, arr is the third test case in the list and must have at least n elements, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, num is the nth element in the second test case, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, and current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y)**.

The code snippet resets the `count` variable to 0 and initializes an empty dictionary `residue_map`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
