Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is the number of elements in the first test case, x and y are the same as before, arr is the first test case in the list and must have at least 1 element, count is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, num is the first element in arr, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y)**

The code calculates the remainders of the first element in the first test case when divided by x and y, and uses these remainders as a key in the residue_map dictionary. It then increments the count by the number of times this key appeared before, and increments the value of this key in the dictionary by 1. The values of x, y, n, and arr are not modified by the code.
