To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for num in arr:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `num` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second element in `arr`.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` must be the third element in `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the number of elements in the first test case, `x` and `y` are the same as before, `arr` is the first test case in the list and must have at least 3 elements, `count` is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, `num` is the third element in `arr`, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by `x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `current_key` is the pair (`num` % `x`, `num` % `y`)**
