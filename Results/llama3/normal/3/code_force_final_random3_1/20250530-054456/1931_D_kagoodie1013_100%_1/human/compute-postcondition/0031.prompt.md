Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, `n` is the number of elements in the first test case, `x` and `y` are the same as before, `arr` is the first test case in the list and must have at least n elements, `count` is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, `num` is the nth element in arr, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `r_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `current_key` is the pair (num % x, num % y), and the value of (num % x, num % y) in residue_map is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, `n` is the number of elements in the second test case, `x` and `y` are the values from the second test case, `arr` is the second test case in the list and must have at least `n` elements, `count` is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before incremented by the value of (r_x, r_y) in `residue_map`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) incremented by 1, `num` is the nth element in the second test case, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `r_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, and `current_key` is the pair (num % x, num % y).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus ... (n times) as its last element, `n` is the number of elements in the third test case, `x` and `y` are the values from the third test case, `arr` is the third test case in the list and must have at least n elements, `count` is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus ... (n times), `residue_map` is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) as a key and the number of times it appeared as its value plus one, `num` is the nth element in the third test case, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `r_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, and `current_key` is the pair (num % x, num % y).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
