Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list with the count of pairs (r_x, r_y) for each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `count`, `residue_map`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` are undefined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `test_cases` list is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The `results` list contains the count of pairs (r_x, r_y) for each test case, which represents the number of times each pair appeared in the corresponding test case. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `count`, `residue_map`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` are no longer defined, as they were only used within the loop and are no longer needed after the loop finishes executing.
