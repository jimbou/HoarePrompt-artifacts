Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus ... (n times) as its last element, `n` is the number of elements in the third test case, `x` and `y` are the values from the third test case, `arr` is the third test case in the list and must have at least n elements, `count` is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus ... (n times), `residue_map` is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) as a key and the number of times it appeared as its value plus one, `num` is the nth element in the third test case, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `r_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, and `current_key` is the pair (num % x, num % y).**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` has been updated with the current count of the pair (r_x, r_y) appearances, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `results` now contains the total count of the pair (r_x, r_y) appearances up to this point, including the current count.
