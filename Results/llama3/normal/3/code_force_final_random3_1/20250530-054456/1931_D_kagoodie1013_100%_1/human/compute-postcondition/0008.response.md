Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is the number of elements in the first test case, x and y are the same as before, arr is the first test case in the list and must have at least 3 elements, count is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, num is the third element in arr, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y), and the value of (num % x, num % y) in residue_map is incremented by 1.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code modifies the values of `r_x`, `r_y`, `count`, `current_key`, and the value of `(num % x, num % y)` in `residue_map`. The new values of `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the remainder of `-num` divided by `x` and the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, respectively. The `count` is incremented by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` appeared before. The `current_key` is updated to be the pair `(num % x, num % y)`, and the value of this key in `residue_map` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
