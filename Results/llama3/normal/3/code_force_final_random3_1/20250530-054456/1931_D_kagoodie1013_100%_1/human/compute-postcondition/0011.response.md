To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change based on the loop's progression. The loop head is `for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, and we've just processed the first test case. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases.

The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are directly assigned from the next test case in `test_cases`. Therefore, their values will change to reflect the next test case.

The other variables (`results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key`) are not directly part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. However, their values will likely change as a result of processing the next test case.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, `n` is the number of elements in the second test case, `x` and `y` are the values from the second test case, `arr` is the second test case in the list and must have at least n elements, `count` is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, `num` is the nth element in the second test case, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `r_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `current_key` is the pair (num % x, num % y), and the value of (num % x, num % y) in residue_map is incremented by 1**
