Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n, x, y, arr are the first test case in the list, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary**

The code initializes two new variables, `count` and `residue_map`, without modifying any existing variables. `count` is set to 0, and `residue_map` is set to an empty dictionary. The initial state of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remains unchanged.
