    #The program returns a list with the count of pairs (r_x, r_y) for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the residues modulo x and y for each integer, and counting the number of pairs of residues that have been seen before. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs of residues for the corresponding test case.
