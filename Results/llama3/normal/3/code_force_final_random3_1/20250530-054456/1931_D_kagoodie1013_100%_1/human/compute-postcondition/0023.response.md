According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` must have at least `n` elements. So for the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 element and `num` is the first element in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, `n` is the number of elements in the third test case, `x` and `y` are the values from the third test case, `arr` is the third test case in the list and must have at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the third test case, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `r_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, and `current_key` is the pair (num % x, num % y)**
