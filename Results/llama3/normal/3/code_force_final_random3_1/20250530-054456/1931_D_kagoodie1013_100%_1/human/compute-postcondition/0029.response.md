Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, n is the number of elements in the third test case, x and y are the values from the third test case, arr is the third test case in the list and must have at least n elements, count is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before plus ... (n times), residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) as a key and the number of times it appeared as its value plus one, num is the nth element in the third test case, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, and current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y).**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in the third test case (arr). The count variable has accumulated the number of times each pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, and the residue_map dictionary has been updated to reflect the frequency of each pair (num % x, num % y). The num variable now points to the last element in the third test case, and the r_x and r_y variables hold the remainders of the last element divided by x and y, respectively. The current_key variable holds the pair (num % x, num % y) for the last element.
