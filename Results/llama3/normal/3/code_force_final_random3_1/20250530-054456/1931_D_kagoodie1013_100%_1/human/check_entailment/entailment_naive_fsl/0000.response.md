Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a residue map to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions. The residue map is used to store the count of numbers that have the same residue modulo x and y. For each number in the array, it calculates the residue modulo x and y, and then checks if there is a pair in the residue map that has the same residue modulo x and y. If there is, it increments the count. The program also correctly handles the case where the same number appears multiple times in the array.

The program also correctly handles the case where x or y is 1, which is a special case because every number has a residue of 0 modulo 1. In this case, the program will correctly count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array is empty, which is a special case because there are no pairs to count. In this case, the program will correctly return 0.

Overall, the program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array, and it correctly handles all the special cases.
