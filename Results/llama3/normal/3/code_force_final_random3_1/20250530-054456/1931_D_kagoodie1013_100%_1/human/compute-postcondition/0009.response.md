Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is the number of elements in the first test case, x and y are the same as before, arr is the first test case in the list and must have at least n elements, count is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, num is the nth element in arr, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y), and the value of (num % x, num % y) in residue_map is incremented by 1.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates over each element in the array `arr`, updating the `count` variable based on the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has appeared before, and incrementing the value of the pair `(num % x, num % y)` in the `residue_map` dictionary. The loop continues until all elements in `arr` have been processed, resulting in the final state described above.
