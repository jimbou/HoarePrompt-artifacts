According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is the first test case in the list, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least 1 element and `num` is now the first element in `arr`.

State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n, x, y, arr is the first test case in the list and must have at least 1 element, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, num is the first element in arr**
