Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, `n` is the number of elements in the second test case, `x` and `y` are the values from the second test case, `arr` is the second test case in the list and must have at least `n` elements, `count` is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before incremented by the value of (r_x, r_y) in `residue_map`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) incremented by 1, `num` is the nth element in the second test case, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `r_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, and `current_key` is the pair (num % x, num % y).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the `results` list now has an additional element, which is the value of `count`. All other variables remain unchanged.
