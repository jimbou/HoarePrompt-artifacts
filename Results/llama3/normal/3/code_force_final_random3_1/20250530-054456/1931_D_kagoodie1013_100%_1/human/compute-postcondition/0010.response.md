Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, `n` is the number of elements in the first test case, `x` and `y` are the same as before, `arr` is the first test case in the list and must have at least n elements, `count` is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, `num` is the nth element in arr, `r_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `r_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `current_key` is the pair (num % x, num % y), and the value of (num % x, num % y) in residue_map is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the results list now includes the count of the pair (r_x, r_y) as its last element, while all other variables remain unchanged.
