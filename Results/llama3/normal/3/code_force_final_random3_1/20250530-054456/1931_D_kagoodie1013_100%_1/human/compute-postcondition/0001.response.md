According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases. If the test_cases has at least 1 test case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, results is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the test_cases must have at least 1 test case and the n, x, y, arr are the first test case in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, n, x, y, arr are the first test case in the list**
