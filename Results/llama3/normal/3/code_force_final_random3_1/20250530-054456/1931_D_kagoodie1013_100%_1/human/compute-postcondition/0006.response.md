Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is the number of elements in the first test case, x and y are the same as before, arr is the first test case in the list and must have at least 2 elements, count is the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key and its value incremented by 1, num is the second element in arr, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y)**

The code executes as follows:

1. The first line calculates the remainder of -num divided by x and assigns it to r_x. Since num is the second element in arr, r_x is the remainder of the negative of the second element in arr divided by x.

2. The second line calculates the remainder of num divided by y and assigns it to r_y. Since num is the second element in arr, r_y is the remainder of the second element in arr divided by y.

3. The third line increments count by the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before. Since residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (r_x, r_y) as a key, count is incremented by the value of residue_map[(r_x, r_y)] if it exists, otherwise it is incremented by 0.

4. The fourth line assigns the pair (num % x, num % y) to current_key. Since num is the second element in arr, current_key is the pair of the remainder of the second element in arr divided by x and the remainder of the second element in arr divided by y.

5. The fifth line increments the value of residue_map[current_key] by 1. Since current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y), the value of residue_map[(num % x, num % y)] is incremented by 1.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of any variables that are modified by the code. The variables r_x, r_y, count, and residue_map are updated based on the calculations performed in the code.
