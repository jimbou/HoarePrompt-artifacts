The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable arr.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the num is the third element in the list.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, n is the number of elements in the second test case, x and y are the values from the second test case, arr is the second test case in the list and must have at least 3 elements, count is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before incremented by the value of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) incremented by 1, num is the third element in the second test case, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, and current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y)**
