Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, n is the number of elements in the second test case, x and y are the values from the second test case, arr is the second test case in the list and must have at least 1 element, count is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) incremented by 1, num is the first element in the second test case, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, and current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y).**

In this output state, the values of `r_x` and `r_y` have been updated based on the new values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The `count` variable has been incremented by the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` appeared before in the `residue_map`. The `residue_map` has been updated with the new pair `(num % x, num % y)` incremented by 1. The `current_key` has been updated to the new pair `(num % x, num % y)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
