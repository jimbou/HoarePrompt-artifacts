Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a. The program uses a dictionary (residue_map) to store the residues modulo x and y for each integer in the array, and it correctly counts the number of pairs of residues that have been seen before. The program also correctly handles the case where the residues modulo x and y are the same for two different integers.

Correctness: **True**
