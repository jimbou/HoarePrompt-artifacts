Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list with the previous count plus the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before as its last element, n is the number of elements in the second test case, x and y are the values from the second test case, arr is the second test case in the list and must have at least 2 elements, count is the number of times the pair (r_x, r_y) appeared before incremented by the value of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the pair (num % x, num % y) incremented by 1, num is the second element in the second test case, r_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, r_y is the remainder of num divided by y, and current_key is the pair (num % x, num % y)**

The code block modifies the values of `r_x`, `r_y`, `count`, `residue_map`, and `current_key`. The first two lines calculate the remainders of `-num` divided by `x` and `num` divided by `y`, respectively, and assign them to `r_x` and `r_y`. The third line increments `count` by the value of `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map`, which represents the number of times the pair `(r_x, r_y)` appeared before. The fourth line updates `residue_map` by incrementing the value of the pair `(num % x, num % y)` by 1. The fifth line assigns the pair `(num % x, num % y)` to `current_key`. The other variables remain unchanged.
