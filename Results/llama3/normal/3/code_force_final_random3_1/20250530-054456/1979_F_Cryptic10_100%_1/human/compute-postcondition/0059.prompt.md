Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing only the integer 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) depending on the values of v2, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1, `p2` is an empty list, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing only the integer 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) depending on the values of v2 that is not empty, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1, `p2` is a list containing the integer v1, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, (v1, v2) is the last tuple in the reversed list ops

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing only the integer 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) depending on the values of v2 that is not empty, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly v1, `p2` is a list containing the integer v1 and possibly v1, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, the next tuple to be processed is the second-to-last tuple in the reversed list `ops`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is a set containing only the integer 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) depending on the values of v2 that has at least two elements, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly v1, `p2` is a list containing the integer v1 and possibly v1 and v1, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and the next tuple to be processed is the last tuple in the reversed list `ops`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
