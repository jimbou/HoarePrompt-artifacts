In this output state, the value of `vx` has been updated to a set of integers from 1 to at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise at least 4 plus v1. The value of `ops` is still an empty list. The values of `p1` and `p2` are still lists that have been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, but since `ops` is empty, these lists are also empty. The value of `_` is still 1. The stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1. The values of v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, and v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input. Finally, the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, is printed, preceded by "! ".
