Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `p1` is an empty list, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input.**

In this output state, the values of `vx`, `ops`, `_`, and stdin remain unchanged. The variables `p1` and `p2` are newly introduced and assigned the values of an empty list and an empty list, respectively.
