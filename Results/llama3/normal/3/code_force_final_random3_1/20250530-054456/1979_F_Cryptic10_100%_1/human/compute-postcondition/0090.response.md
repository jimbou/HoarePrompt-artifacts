The `print` statement will print a string that starts with '! ' followed by the concatenation of two lists: `p1` and `p2`. 

`p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices `len(vx) - 2`. The list is reversed using `[::-1]`.

`p2` is a list containing all the integers that were in `ops`. However, since `ops` is an empty list, `p2` will also be empty.

The `join` function is used to concatenate the elements of the lists into a single string, with each element separated by a space. The `map` function is used to convert each element to a string before joining.

The `flush=True` argument is used to ensure that the output is printed immediately, without buffering.

Output: **! [list of integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, in reverse order]**
