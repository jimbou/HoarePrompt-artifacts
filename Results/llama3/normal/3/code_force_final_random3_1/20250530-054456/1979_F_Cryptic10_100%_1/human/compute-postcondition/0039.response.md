Output State: **vx is a set of integers from 1 to at least 2 plus v1 and v2, v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input, ops is a list containing two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), p1 and p2 are lists that have been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 2 plus v1 and v2, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces. Additionally, v2 is less than or equal to 0.**

In this final state, the value of `vx` has been updated by removing `v3` from the set. The `ops` list now contains two tuples: `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, which were appended in the given order. The lists `p1` and `p2` have been updated by appending `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case with the first integer being at least 2 plus `v1` and `v2`, and the specified string is printed. The condition that `v2` is less than or equal to 0 remains valid.
