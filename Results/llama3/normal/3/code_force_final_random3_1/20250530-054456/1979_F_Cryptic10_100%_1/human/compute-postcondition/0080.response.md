Postcondition: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 5, minus the integer v1 and possibly v3, and also minus the integer that was at the index len(vx) - 2, and if v2 > 0, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) and possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0) and also the tuple (v1, v2), otherwise, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer and possibly v3 is an integer.**
