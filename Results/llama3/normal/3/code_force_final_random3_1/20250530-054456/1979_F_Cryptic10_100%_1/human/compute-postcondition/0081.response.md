Output State: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, ops is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer and possibly v3 is an integer.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the set vx has been updated to exclude the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, and the list ops contains tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0). The other variables in the precondition, p1, p2, _, and stdin, remain unchanged.
