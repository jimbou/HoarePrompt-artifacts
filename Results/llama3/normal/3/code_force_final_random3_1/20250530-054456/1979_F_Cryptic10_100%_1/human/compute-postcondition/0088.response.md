Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing at least three tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is a list containing v1 if p1[-1] == v2, otherwise p2 is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` and `v2` are the third-to-last tuple in `ops`, stdin contains the rest of the test case, and (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) has v1 appended to it, and now (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) has v1 appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) now has v1 appended to it. This means that if the last element of p1 is equal to v2, then p2 now contains v1, otherwise p1 now contains v1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
