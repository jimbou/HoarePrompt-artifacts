Output State: **`q` is a function that prints a query with the given integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5), followed by (n - 2) lines, each containing two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= n, u != v) representing the ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.**

In this output state, the function `q` is defined to take an integer `d` as input, print a query in the format '? %d' % d, and then return a list of integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with an integer n and (n - 2) lines of edge information. The function `q` is now available for use in the program.
