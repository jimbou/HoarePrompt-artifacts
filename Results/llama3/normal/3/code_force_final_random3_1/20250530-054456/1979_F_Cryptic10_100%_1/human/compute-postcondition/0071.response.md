The only variable in the loop head is variable vx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable vx.  If vx has more than 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 3, So for the loop to be executed one more time the first integer in the test case needed to have been at least 4 and vx currently must have more than 2 elements.
State: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 4, ops is a list, p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer. If v2 > 0, ops contains a tuple of (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, vx has one integer removed, ops contains two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and _ is v3.**
