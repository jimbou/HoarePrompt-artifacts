Postcondition: ***vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 4, minus the integer v1 and possibly v3, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) and possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer and possibly v3 is an integer. If v2 > 0, ops contains two tuples of (v1, v2). Otherwise, vx is updated to exclude v3, ops contains three tuples of (v1, v2), (v3, 0), (v1, 0).***
