Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `p2` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the second last two integers from the input, ops has at least 2 tuples, and either p1 or p2 has been appended with v1 depending on whether the last element of p1 is equal to v2 or not, and v1 and v2 are updated to the values of the next tuple in the ops list**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` remains empty. The lists `p1` and `p2` may have been appended with the value `v1`, depending on whether the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. The list `ops` still contains tuples of integers, and the variable `_` remains 0. The input stream `stdin` still contains at least one test case with a specific format. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are updated to the next tuple in the `ops` list.
