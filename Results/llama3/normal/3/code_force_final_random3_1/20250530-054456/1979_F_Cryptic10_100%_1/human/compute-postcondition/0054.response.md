Output State: **`vx` is a set containing only the integer 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) depending on the values of v2 that is not empty, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1, `p2` is a list containing the integer v1, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, (v1, v2) is the last tuple in the reversed list ops**

In this output state, the list `p2` now contains the integer `v1` because `p1[-1]` is 1 and `v2` is not 1 (since `vx` is a set containing only the integer 1), so `p2` is appended with `v1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The print statement still holds true, with the updated lists `p1` and `p2`.
