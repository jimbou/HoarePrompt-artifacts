Output State: **`q` is a function that prints a query with the given integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input, `ops` is an empty list, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the first integer.**

In this output state, the value of `vx` is determined by the first integer in the input, which is used to generate a set of integers from 1 to that value. The value of `ops` is an empty list, as it is initialized as such. The values of `q` and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the first integer that was used to determine the value of `vx`.
