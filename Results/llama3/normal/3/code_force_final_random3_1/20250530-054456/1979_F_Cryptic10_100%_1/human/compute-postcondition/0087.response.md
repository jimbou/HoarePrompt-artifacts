The only objects in the loop head are variables  ops, v1 and v2, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ops.  If the list has at least 3 tuples the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, ops has at least two tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), v1 and v2 are the second-to-last tuple in ops. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 tuples and the v1 and v2 are the third-to-last tuple in ops.
State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing at least three tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is a list containing v1 if p1[-1] == v2, otherwise p2 is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` and `v2` are the third-to-last tuple in `ops`, stdin contains the rest of the test case, and (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) has v1 appended to it.**
