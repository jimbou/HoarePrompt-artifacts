Output State: **`q` is a function that prints a query with the given integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus `v1` and `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus `v1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v1, v2)` and `(v1, v2)`, `_` is 0, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are integers from the input, `v1` and `v2` are the last two integers from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus `v1` and `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus `v1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The function `q` remains unchanged, the set `vx` remains unchanged, the list `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`, the variable `_` remains 0, and the values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case with the specified conditions.
