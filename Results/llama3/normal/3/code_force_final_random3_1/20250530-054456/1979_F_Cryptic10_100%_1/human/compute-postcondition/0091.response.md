Output: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, ops is an empty list, p1 is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, p2 is a list containing all the integers that were in ops, _ is an integer, v1 and v2 are the first tuple in ops, stdin contains the rest of the test case, and this is printed: '! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), where p1[::-1] is the reverse of p1 and p2 is an empty list, so the output will be '! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1)), where p1 is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2**
