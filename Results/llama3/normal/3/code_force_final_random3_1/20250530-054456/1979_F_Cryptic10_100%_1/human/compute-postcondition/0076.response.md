The only variable in the loop head is variable vx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable vx. If the length of vx is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 4, minus the integer v1 and possibly v3. For the loop to be executed one more time, the length of vx must be greater than 2, so vx must contain at least 3 integers. This means that the first integer in the test case must be at least 5, and v1 and v3 must not be equal to all the integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case.

State: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 5, minus the integer v1 and possibly v3, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) and possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer and possibly v3 is an integer. If v2 > 0, ops contains two tuples of (v1, v2). Otherwise, vx is updated to exclude v3, ops contains three tuples of (v1, v2), (v3, 0), (v1, 0).**
