Output State: **vx is an empty set, ops is an empty list, p1 is a list containing all integers from 1 to the first integer in the test case, p2 is an empty list, _ is equal to the number of test cases, stdin is empty, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, which is equivalent to "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1, with elements separated by spaces.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the set vx will be empty, the list ops will be empty, the list p1 will contain all integers from 1 to the first integer in the test case, the list p2 will be empty, the variable _ will be equal to the number of test cases, the standard input stdin will be empty, and the output will be a string that starts with "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1, with elements separated by spaces.
