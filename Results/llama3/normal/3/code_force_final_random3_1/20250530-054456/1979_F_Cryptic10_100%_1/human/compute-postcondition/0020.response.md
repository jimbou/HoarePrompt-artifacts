Output State: **vx is an empty set, ops is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the set `vx` is empty, the list `ops` contains tuples of integers from the input, the variable `_` remains 0, and the standard input contains at least one test case with the first integer being at least 4 plus the sum of `v1` and `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus `v1`. The integers `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are from the input, and `v1` and `v2` are the last two integers from the input.
