Output State: **vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1, v3 and the value of v3 obtained from q(0), ops is a list containing the tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), _ is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input.**

In this output state, the value of v3 obtained from q(0) is removed from vx. The list ops now contains four tuples: (v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). The value of _ remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains the remaining test cases. The values of v1, v2 and v3 remain unchanged as integers from the input.
