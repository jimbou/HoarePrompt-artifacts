Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `p2` is a list that has been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `ops` is an empty list, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `vx` remains an empty set, `p1` and `p2` are lists that have been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `ops` is an empty list, and the other variables remain unchanged. The loop has iterated over all the tuples in the `ops` list, appending the `v1` values to either `p1` or `p2` depending on the condition in the loop body.
