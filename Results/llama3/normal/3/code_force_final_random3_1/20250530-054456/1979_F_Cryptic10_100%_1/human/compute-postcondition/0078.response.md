Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 5, minus the integer `v1` and possibly `v3`, and also minus the integer that was at the index `len(vx) - 2`, `ops` is a list containing a tuple of (`v1`, `v2`) and possibly (`v3`, 0), (`v1`, 0) and also the tuple (`v1`, `v2`), `p1` is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, `p2` is a list containing some integers, `_` is an integer, `stdin` contains the rest of the test case, `v1` is an integer, `v2` is an integer and possibly `v3` is an integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` remains unchanged, containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, excluding `v1`, possibly `v3`, and the integer at the index `len(vx) - 2`. The list `ops` now contains an additional tuple (`v1`, `v2`) in addition to its previous contents. The lists `p1` and `p2`, the integer `_`, and the values of `v1`, `v2`, and possibly `v3` remain unchanged. The standard input `stdin` still contains the rest of the test case.
