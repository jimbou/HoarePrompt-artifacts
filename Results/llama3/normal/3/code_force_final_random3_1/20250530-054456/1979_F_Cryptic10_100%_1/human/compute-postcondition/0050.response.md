Postcondition: ***vx is a set of integers from 1 to at least 2 plus v2, v1 and v2 are integers, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise ops is a list containing three or four tuples: (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, v2) if v2 > 0 or (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, p1 and p2 are lists that have been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1 plus v1 and v2, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, and ops has been appended with the tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0.***
