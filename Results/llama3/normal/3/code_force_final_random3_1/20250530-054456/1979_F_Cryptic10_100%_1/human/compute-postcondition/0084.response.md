Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is a list containing v1 if p1[-1] == v2, otherwise p2 is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` is an integer, `v2` is an integer and possibly `v3` is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, `v1` and `v2` are the last tuple in `ops`**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` remains unchanged, containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2. The list `ops` also remains unchanged. The list `p1` remains the same, containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2. The list `p2` is updated to contain the integer `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, otherwise it remains an empty list. The values of `_`, `v1`, `v2`, and possibly `v3` are unchanged. The stdin still contains the rest of the test case. The last tuple in `ops` is still (`v1`, `v2`).
