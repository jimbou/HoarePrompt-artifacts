Output State: `vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has been appended with all the `v1` values from the `ops` list where the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list that has been appended with all the `v1` values from the `ops` list where the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `ops` is an empty list, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `vx` remains an empty set, `p1` and `p2` are lists that have been appended with all the `v1` values from the `ops` list based on whether the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2` or not, `ops` is an empty list because all its elements have been processed, and the other variables remain unchanged.
