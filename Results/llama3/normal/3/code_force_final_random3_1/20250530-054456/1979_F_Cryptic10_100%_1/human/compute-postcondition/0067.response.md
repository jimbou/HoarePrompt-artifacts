Output State: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 3, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, and the current value of v2 is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the list `ops` has been updated to include a tuple containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `vx` still contains integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, which is at least 3. The lists `p1` and `p2` still contain their respective integers. The variable `_` is still 0. The stdin still contains the rest of the test case. The values of `v1` and `v2` are still an integer and greater than 0, respectively.
