Output State: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 4, minus the integer v1, ops is a list containing two tuples of (v1, v2), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer.**

In this output state, the list `ops` now contains two tuples of `(v1, v2)`, where the first tuple was already present in the initial state and the second tuple is the new one added by the code. The other variables remain unchanged.
