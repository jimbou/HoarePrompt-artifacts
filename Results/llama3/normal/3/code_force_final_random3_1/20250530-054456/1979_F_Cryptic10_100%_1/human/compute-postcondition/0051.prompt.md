Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list that has been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `p2` is a list that has been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *vx is a set of integers from 1 to at least 3 plus v3, v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise ops is a list containing two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), p1 and p2 are lists that have been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 3 plus v3 if v2 > 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 2 plus v1 and v2, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *vx is a set of integers from 1 to at least 2 plus v1 and v2, v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise ops is a list containing three tuples: (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, v2) if v2 > 0 or (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, p1 and p2 are lists that have been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 2 plus v3 if v2 > 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 1 plus v1 and v2, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, v1 is removed from vx.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *vx is a set of integers from 1 to at least 2 plus v2, v1 and v2 are integers, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise ops is a list containing three or four tuples: (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, v2) if v2 > 0 or (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, p1 and p2 are lists that have been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1 plus v1 and v2, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, and ops has been appended with the tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
