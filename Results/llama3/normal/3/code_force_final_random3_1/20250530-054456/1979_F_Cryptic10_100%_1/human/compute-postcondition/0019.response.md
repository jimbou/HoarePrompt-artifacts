Postcondition: ***vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1, ops is a list containing the tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing the tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0) and (v1, v2), _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input. If v2 > 0, ops contains the tuples (v1, v2) and (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, v3 is removed from vx and ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). The first integer in the input must be at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1.***
