Output State: **vx is a set containing only the integer 1, ops is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) depending on the values of v2, p1 and p2 are lists that have been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the set vx will only contain the integer 1, the list ops will contain tuples of (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 is less than or equal to 0, the lists p1 and p2 will have been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, the variable _ will still be 1, the stdin will contain at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and the output will be the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, preceded by "! ".
