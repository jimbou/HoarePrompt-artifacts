According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ops. If ops has at least 1 tuple the loop executes. Before the loop starts, vx is an empty set, p1 is an empty list, p2 is an empty list, ops is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input. So for the loop to be executed ops must have at least 1 tuple and v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input.
State: **`vx` is an empty set, `p1` is an empty list, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input, ops has at least 1 tuple, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input**
