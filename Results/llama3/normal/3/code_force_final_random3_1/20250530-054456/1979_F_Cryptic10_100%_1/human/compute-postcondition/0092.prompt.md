Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that prints a query with the given integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5), followed by (n - 2) lines, each containing two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= n, u != v) representing the ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `p2` is a list that has been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `ops` is an empty list, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing only the integer 1, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, `p2` is a list containing some integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, ops is an empty list, p1 is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, p2 is a list containing all the integers that were in ops, _ is an integer, v1 and v2 are the first tuple in ops, stdin contains the rest of the test case, and this is printed: '! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), where p1[::-1] is the reverse of p1 and p2 is an empty list, so the output will be '! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1)), where p1 is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
