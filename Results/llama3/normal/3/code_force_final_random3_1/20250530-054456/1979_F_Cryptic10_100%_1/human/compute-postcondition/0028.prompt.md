Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is an empty set, `p1` is an empty list, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `p2` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input, ops has at least 1 tuple, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `p2` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the second last two integers from the input, ops has at least 2 tuples, and either p1 or p2 has been appended with v1 depending on whether the last element of p1 is equal to v2 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `p2` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the second last two integers from the input, ops has at least 2 tuples, and either p1 or p2 has been appended with v1 depending on whether the last element of p1 is equal to v2 or not, and v1 and v2 are updated to the values of the next tuple in the ops list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
