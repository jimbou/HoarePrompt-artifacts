Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` is an integer, `v2` is an integer and possibly `v3` is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is a list containing v1 if p1[-1] == v2, otherwise p2 is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` is an integer, `v2` is an integer and possibly `v3` is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, `v1` and `v2` are the last tuple in `ops`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is a list containing v1 if p1[-1] == v2, otherwise p2 is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` and `v2` are the second-to-last tuple in `ops`, stdin contains the rest of the test case, and (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) has v1 appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing at least three tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is a list containing v1 if p1[-1] == v2, otherwise p2 is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` and `v2` are the third-to-last tuple in `ops`, stdin contains the rest of the test case, and (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) has v1 appended to it, and now (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) has v1 appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
