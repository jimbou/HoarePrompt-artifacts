Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is a list containing v1 if p1[-1] == v2, otherwise p2 is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` and `v2` are the second-to-last tuple in `ops`, stdin contains the rest of the test case, and (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) has v1 appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` and the list `ops` remain unchanged. The list `p1` remains the same, but either `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it, depending on whether the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. The value of `_` and the contents of stdin also remain unchanged.
