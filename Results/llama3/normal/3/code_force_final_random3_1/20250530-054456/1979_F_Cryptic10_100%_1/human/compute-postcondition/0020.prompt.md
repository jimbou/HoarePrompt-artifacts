Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that prints a query with the given integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input, `ops` is an empty list, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the first integer.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *q is a function that prints a query with the given integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 3 minus the first integer, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *q is a function that prints a query with the given integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input. If v2 > 0, ops contains the tuples (v1, v2) and (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, v3 is removed from vx and ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1, ops is a list containing the tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing the tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0) and (v1, v2), _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input. If v2 > 0, ops contains the tuples (v1, v2) and (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, v3 is removed from vx and ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). The first integer in the input must be at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
