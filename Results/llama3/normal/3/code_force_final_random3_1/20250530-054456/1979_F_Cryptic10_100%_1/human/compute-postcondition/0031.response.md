Output: **`vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `p2` is a list that has been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `ops` is an empty list, `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces**
