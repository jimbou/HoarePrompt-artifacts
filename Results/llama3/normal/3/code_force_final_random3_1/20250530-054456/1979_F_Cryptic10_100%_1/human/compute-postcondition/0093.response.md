Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by (n - 2) lines of edge information. It then performs a series of queries and operations to reconstruct the original graph, and finally prints the reconstructed graph in a specific format. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the reconstructed graph to standard output. The final state of the program is that all input has been consumed, and the reconstructed graph has been printed to standard output.**
