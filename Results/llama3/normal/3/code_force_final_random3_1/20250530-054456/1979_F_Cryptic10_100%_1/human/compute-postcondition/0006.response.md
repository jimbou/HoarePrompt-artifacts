Output State: **`q` is a function that prints a query with the given integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1, `ops` is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 3 minus the first integer, v1 and v2 are integers from the input. The current value of v2 is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `ops` has been updated to include a tuple containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 3 minus the first integer, and `v2` is still greater than 0.
