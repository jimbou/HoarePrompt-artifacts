Output State: **`vx` is a set containing only the integer 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) depending on the values of v2 that has at least two elements, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly v1, `p2` is a list containing the integer v1 and possibly v1 and v1, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and the next tuple to be processed is the last tuple in the reversed list `ops`**

In this output state, the value of `p2` has been updated to include `v1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, otherwise, the value of `p1` has been updated to include `v1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The next tuple to be processed is now the last tuple in the reversed list `ops`.
