Output State: **vx is a set of integers from 1 to at least 3 plus v2, v1 and v2 are integers, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise ops is a list containing three tuples: (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, v2) if v2 > 0 or (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, p1 and p2 are lists that have been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 2 plus v3 if v2 > 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 1 plus v1 and v2, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces, and ops has been appended with the tuple (v1, v2)**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the ops list has been appended with the tuple (v1, v2). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
