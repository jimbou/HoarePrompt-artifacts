Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing tuples of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` is an integer, `v2` is an integer and possibly `v3` is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case.**

In this output state, `p1` is now a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, which is a copy of the set `vx`. `p2` is now an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.
