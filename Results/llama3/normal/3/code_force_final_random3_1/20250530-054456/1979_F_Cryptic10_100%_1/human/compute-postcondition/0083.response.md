To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ops`, `v1`, and `v2`. The loop will execute if `ops` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ops` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing all integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case, minus the integers that were at the indices len(vx) - 2, `p2` is an empty list, `_` is an integer, `v1` is an integer, `v2` is an integer and possibly `v3` is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, `v1` and `v2` are the last tuple in `ops`**
