Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `p2` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input, ops has at least 1 tuple, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The set `vx` remains empty. The list `p1` or `p2` has been appended with the value `v1`, depending on whether the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. The list `ops` and the variable `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case with the specified conditions. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are still integers from the input, and `v1` and `v2` are the last two integers from the input.
