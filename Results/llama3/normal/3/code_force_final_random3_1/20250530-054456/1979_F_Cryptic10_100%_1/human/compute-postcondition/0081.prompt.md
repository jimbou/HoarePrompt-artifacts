Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the first integer in the test case, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, `p2` is a list containing some integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test case.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 3, ops is a list, p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer. If v2 > 0, ops contains a tuple of (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, vx has one integer removed, ops contains two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and _ is v3.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 4, minus the integer v1 and possibly v3, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) and possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer and possibly v3 is an integer. If v2 > 0, ops contains two tuples of (v1, v2). Otherwise, vx is updated to exclude v3, ops contains three tuples of (v1, v2), (v3, 0), (v1, 0).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 5, minus the integer v1 and possibly v3, and also minus the integer that was at the index len(vx) - 2, and if v2 > 0, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) and possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0) and also the tuple (v1, v2), otherwise, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2), possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer and possibly v3 is an integer.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
