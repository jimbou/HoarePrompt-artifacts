Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to at least 3 plus v3, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are integers from the input, `ops` is a list containing a tuple of (`v1`, `v2`) if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` is a list containing three tuples: (`v3`, 0), (`v1`, 0), and (`v1`, `v2`), `p1` and `p2` are lists that have been appended with `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 2 plus `v3` if `v2` > 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 1 plus `v1` and `v2`, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists `p1` and `p2`, with elements separated by spaces, `v1` is removed from `vx`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` still contains integers from 1 to at least 3 plus `v3`, and the values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are still integers from the input. The list `ops` now contains an additional tuple of (`v1`, `v2`) if `v2` is positive, or three tuples if `v2` is not positive. The lists `p1` and `p2` have been updated with the `v1` values from the `ops` list in reverse order. The value of `_` remains 1. The stdin still contains at least one test case with the specified conditions. The concatenation of the reversed lists `p1` and `p2` is printed, followed by "! ". The value of `v1` is removed from the set `vx`.
