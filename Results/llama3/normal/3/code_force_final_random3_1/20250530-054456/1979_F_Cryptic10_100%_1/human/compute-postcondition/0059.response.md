Output State: **`vx` is a set containing only the integer 1, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, `p2` is a list containing some integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 1, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the set `vx` still contains only the integer 1, the list `ops` is empty because all its elements have been processed, the list `p1` contains the initial integer 1 and possibly some other integers that were appended during the loop iterations, the list `p2` contains some integers that were appended during the loop iterations, the variable `_` remains 1, and the input stream `stdin` still contains at least one test case with the first integer being at least 1. Finally, the output is printed as before, with the concatenation of the reversed lists `p1` and `p2`, separated by spaces, prefixed with "! ".
