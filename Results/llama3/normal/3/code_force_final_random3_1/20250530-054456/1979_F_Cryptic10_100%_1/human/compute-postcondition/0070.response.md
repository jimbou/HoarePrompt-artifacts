Postcondition: ***vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 3, ops is a list, p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer. If v2 > 0, ops contains a tuple of (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, vx has one integer removed, ops contains two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and _ is v3.***
