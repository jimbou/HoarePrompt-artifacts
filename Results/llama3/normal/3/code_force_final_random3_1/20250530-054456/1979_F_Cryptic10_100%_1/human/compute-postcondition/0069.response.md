Output State: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 3, with one integer removed, ops is a list containing two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is v3, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer and v2 is less than or equal to 0, stdin contains the rest of the test case**

In this output state, the set vx has one integer removed, which is v3. The list ops now contains two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). The variable _ now holds the value of v3. The other variables p1, p2, v1, v2, and stdin remain unchanged.
