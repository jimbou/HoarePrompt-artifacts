Postcondition: **vx is a set of integers from 1 to at least 3 plus v3, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, ops is an empty list, p1 is a list that has been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, p2 is a list that has been appended with v1 values from the ops list in reverse order, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 3 plus v3, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed lists p1 and p2, with elements separated by spaces. The current value of v2 is higher than 0.**
