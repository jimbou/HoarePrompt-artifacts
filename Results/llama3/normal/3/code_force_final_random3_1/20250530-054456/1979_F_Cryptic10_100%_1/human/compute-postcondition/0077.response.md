Output State: **vx is a set containing integers from 2 to the first integer in the test case which must be at least 5, minus the integer v1 and possibly v3, and also minus the integer that was at the index len(vx) - 2, ops is a list containing a tuple of (v1, v2) and possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing the integer 1 and possibly some other integers, p2 is a list containing some integers, _ is an integer, stdin contains the rest of the test case, v1 is an integer, v2 is an integer and possibly v3 is an integer.**

In this output state, the set vx has been updated to exclude the integer v1 and possibly v3, and also the integer that was at the index len(vx) - 2. The list ops still contains a tuple of (v1, v2) and possibly (v3, 0), (v1, 0). The lists p1 and p2, the integer _, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The values of v1, v2, and possibly v3 are also unchanged.
