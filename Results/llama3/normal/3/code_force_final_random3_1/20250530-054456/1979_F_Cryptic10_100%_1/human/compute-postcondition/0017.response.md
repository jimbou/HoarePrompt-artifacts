Output State: **vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise vx is a set of integers from 1 to the first integer in the input minus v1, ops is a list containing the tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing the tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0) and (v1, v2), _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the last two integers from the input.**

In this output state, the list `ops` has been updated to include the tuple `(v1, v2)` regardless of the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `vx` still depends on the value of `v2`, and the input in `stdin` is still valid. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are still integers from the input, and `v1` and `v2` are still the last two integers from the input.
