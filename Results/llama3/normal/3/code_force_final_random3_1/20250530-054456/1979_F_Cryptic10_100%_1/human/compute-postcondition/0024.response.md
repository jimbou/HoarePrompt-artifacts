The only variables in the loop head are variables  `v1`, `v2` and `ops`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops`. If `ops` has at least 2 tuples the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` has at least 1 tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the last two integers from the input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `ops` must have at least 2 tuples and `v1` and `v2` are the second last two integers from the input.
State: **`vx` is an empty set, `p1` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `p2` is a list that has either been appended with `v1` or remains empty, `ops` is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise ops is a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `_` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case where the first integer is at least 4 plus v1 and v3 if v2 is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the first integer is at least 4 plus v1, v1, v2 and v3 are integers from the input, v1 and v2 are the second last two integers from the input, ops has at least 2 tuples**
