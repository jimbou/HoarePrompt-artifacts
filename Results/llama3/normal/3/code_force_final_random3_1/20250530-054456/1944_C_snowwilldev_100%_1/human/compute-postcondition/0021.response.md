Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N+1` integers between 0 and `N`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N`, `N` must be greater than 1, `t` is less than 3 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, `i` is `N+2`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 and `t` is 2. Otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1.***
