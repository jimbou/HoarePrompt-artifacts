#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `N-1`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: `N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `N`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a test case from standard input, where the first line contains an integer N and the second line contains N integers between 0 and N-1. It then counts the occurrences of each integer and returns the smallest integer that appears either once or not at all in the input list. If no such integer is found, it returns N. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input.
