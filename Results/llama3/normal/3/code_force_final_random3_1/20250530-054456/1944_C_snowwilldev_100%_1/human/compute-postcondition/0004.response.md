Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[1]]` has been incremented by 1, in addition to the initial increment of `cnt[a[0]]` by 1. The values of `N`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
