To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. If `N` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `N` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, we can conclude that `N` is at least 1. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop executes.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0, which is the first value in the range of `N`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0**
