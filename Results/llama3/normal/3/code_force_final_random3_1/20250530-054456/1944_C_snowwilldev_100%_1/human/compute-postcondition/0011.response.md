Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `t` is 1, `N` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, and since we have processed one test case, it now contains multiple test cases minus 2.
