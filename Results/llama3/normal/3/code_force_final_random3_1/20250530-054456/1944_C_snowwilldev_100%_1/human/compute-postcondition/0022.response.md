Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `N`, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` is equal to `N`, and `t` is equal to the number of unique elements in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
