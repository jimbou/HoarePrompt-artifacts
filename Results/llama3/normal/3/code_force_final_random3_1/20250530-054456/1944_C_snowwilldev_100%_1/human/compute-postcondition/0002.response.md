The code increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1 in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `i` is 0, the count of the first element in the list `a` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0**
