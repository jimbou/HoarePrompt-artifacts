Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[2]]` has been incremented by 1, because `i` is 2 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
