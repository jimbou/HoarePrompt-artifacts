Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `N` must be greater than 0, `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, `i` is `N+1`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 and `t` is 1. Otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1.***
