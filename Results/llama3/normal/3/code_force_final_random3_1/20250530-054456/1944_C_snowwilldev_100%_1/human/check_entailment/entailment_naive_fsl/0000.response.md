Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The key insight is that Alice should aim to create a situation where there are at least two numbers that appear only once in the array `a`, because this will force Bob to remove one of them, allowing Alice to take the other one and create a MEX of at least 2.

The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N` (the size of the array) and checks if the count of each number is 1. If it finds two numbers with a count of 1, it returns the current number, because this means that Alice can take one of these numbers and Bob will be forced to take the other one, resulting in a MEX of at least 2.

If the program doesn't find two numbers with a count of 1, it returns the first number that has a count of 0, because this means that Alice can take this number and Bob will not be able to take it, resulting in a MEX of at least 1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the array `a` contains only one number, in which case the MEX is 1. It also correctly handles the case where the array `a` contains multiple numbers that appear only once, in which case the MEX is at least 2.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game.
