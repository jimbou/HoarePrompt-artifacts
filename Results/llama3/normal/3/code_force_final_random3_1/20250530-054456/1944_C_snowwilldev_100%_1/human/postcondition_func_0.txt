This function reads a test case from standard input, where the first line contains an integer N and the second line contains N integers between 0 and N-1. It then counts the occurrences of each integer and returns the smallest integer that appears either once or not at all in the input list. If no such integer is found, it returns N. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input.
