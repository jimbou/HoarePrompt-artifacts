Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `t` which is assigned the value 0.
