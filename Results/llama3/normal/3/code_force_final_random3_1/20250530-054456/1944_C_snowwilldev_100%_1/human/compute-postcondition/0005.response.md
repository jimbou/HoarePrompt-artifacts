The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 2.
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 2**
