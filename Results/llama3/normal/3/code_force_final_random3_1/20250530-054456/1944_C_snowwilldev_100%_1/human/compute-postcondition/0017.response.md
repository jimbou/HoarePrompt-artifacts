Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 if `cnt[i]` is not equal to 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 if `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1, `N` must be greater than 0, `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, `i` is `N+1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `stdin` depends on the value of `cnt[i]`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2. Otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1.
