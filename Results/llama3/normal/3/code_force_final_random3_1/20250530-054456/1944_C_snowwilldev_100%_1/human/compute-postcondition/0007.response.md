Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers between 0 and `N-1`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `N-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same range for `N` and the same structure for `a`. The `cnt` dictionary will have incremented the count for each element in `a` by 1, reflecting the total occurrences of each element in `a`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The loop variable `i` will be `N-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
