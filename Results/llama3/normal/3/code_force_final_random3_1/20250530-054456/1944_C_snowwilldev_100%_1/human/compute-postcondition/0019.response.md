To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `N`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `N+1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N+1`, so `i` should be `N+2`. However, since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we can only adjust `N` to make the loop execute again. 

So, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i`, which is `N+1`. Therefore, `N` must be at least `N+2`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `N+1` integers between 0 and `N`, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N`, `N` must be greater than 1, `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, `i` is `N+2`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 and `t` is 1. Otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1.**
