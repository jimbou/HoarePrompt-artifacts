Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1` or the first element in `inp`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to the first element in `inp` and `ans` remains 0. If `a` is larger than `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is set to 1.***
