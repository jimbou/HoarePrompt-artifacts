Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `x` is the next element in `inp` after the current value of `x`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, the first element in `inp`, or the next element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one more element after the new value of `x`, `a` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is updated to the next element in `inp`. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `x` remains the current value of `a`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, the state of the variables remains unchanged, otherwise, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3.**
