Output: **`n` is an integer, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` minus the number of unique elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to `y`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and the number of elements in `inp` minus the number of unique elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to `y` is being printed**
