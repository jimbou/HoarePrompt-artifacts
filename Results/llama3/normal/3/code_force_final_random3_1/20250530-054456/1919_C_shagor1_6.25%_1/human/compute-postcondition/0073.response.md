Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 3, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is equal to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `y` is unchanged, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a` is greater than `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is updated to be equal to `a`. The value of `y` is updated to be equal to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a` is greater than `y`. The values of `n`, `inp`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
