The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, the number of test cases is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the _ is 1 and the number of test cases is at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` minus the number of unique elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to `y`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and the number of elements in `inp` minus the number of unique elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to `y` is being printed**
