Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, inp is a list of integers, x is n+1, y is n+1, ans is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, a is the last element in inp that was processed by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 2. If the first element in `inp` is less than or equal to `n+1`, then `x` is set to the value of the first element in `inp`. If the first element in `inp` is less than or equal to `n+1` but larger than `n+1`, then `y` is set to the value of the first element in `inp`. If the first element in `inp` is larger than `n+1`, then `x` and `y` are set to the value of the first element in `inp`, and `ans` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 2. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is equal to `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `x` is equal to `y` which is equal to `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 3. `x` is equal to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `x` is equal to `y` which is equal to `a`. `y` is equal to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `y` is unchanged. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a` is greater than `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
