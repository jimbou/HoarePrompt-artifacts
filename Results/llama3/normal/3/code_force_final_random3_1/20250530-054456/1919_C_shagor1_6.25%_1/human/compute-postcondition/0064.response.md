Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n+1`, `y` is `n+1`, `ans` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `a` is the first element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n+1`, then `y` is set to the value of `a`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` are set to the value of `a`, and `ans` is set to 1.***
