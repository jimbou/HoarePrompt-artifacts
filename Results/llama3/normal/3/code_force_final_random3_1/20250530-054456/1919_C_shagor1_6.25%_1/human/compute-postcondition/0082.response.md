Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then finds the number of duplicate elements in the list by tracking the smallest and second smallest elements encountered so far. The function prints the count of duplicate elements for each test case.**
