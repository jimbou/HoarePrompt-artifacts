To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a` and `inp`. The loop will execute if `inp` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `inp` to have at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element in `inp`**
