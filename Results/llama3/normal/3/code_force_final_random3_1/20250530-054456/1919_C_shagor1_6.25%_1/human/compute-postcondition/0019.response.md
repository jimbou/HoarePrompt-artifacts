Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is the next element in `inp` after the current value of `x`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, the first element in `inp`, or the next element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0, 1 or 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one more element after the new value of `x`, `a` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the next element in `inp` after the current value of `x`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and `inp` still has at least one more element after the new value of `x`. The value of `a` is also updated to be the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`.
