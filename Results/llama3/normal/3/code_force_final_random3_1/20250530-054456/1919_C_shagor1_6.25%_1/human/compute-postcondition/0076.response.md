Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 3. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is equal to `a`, and `x` is equal to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `x` is equal to `y` which is equal to `a`. If `a` is not less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, `x` is equal to `y` which is equal to `a`.***
