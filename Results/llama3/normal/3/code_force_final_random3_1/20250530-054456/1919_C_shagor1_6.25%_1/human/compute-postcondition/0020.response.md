Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is the current value of `a`, `y` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`, `ans` is 0, 1 or 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one more element after the new value of `x`, `a` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`, which is the same as the new value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
