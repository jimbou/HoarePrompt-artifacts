The first line checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since `x` is `n+1` and `y` is also `n+1`, this condition is true. The second line assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is larger than `x` and `y`, `y` becomes larger than its original value. The third line increments `ans` by 1, making `ans` equal to 1.

Output State: **n is an integer, x is n+1, y is a and is larger than x, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, inp is a list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in inp and is larger than x.**
