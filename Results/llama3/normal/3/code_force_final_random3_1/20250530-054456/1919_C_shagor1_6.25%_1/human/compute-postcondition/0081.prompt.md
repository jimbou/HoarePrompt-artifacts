Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` minus the number of unique elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to `y`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and the number of elements in `inp` minus the number of unique elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to `y` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `x` is the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to `n+1`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to `n+1`, `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than `n+1` and the number of times an element in `inp` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `x`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `inp` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `a` is the last element in `inp` that was processed by the loop, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, inp is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n inputs, _ is n, x is the smallest element in the original inp list, y is the second smallest element in the original inp list, ans is the number of elements in the original inp list minus the number of unique elements in the original inp list, a is the last element in the original inp list, and the number of duplicate elements in the original inp list which is ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
