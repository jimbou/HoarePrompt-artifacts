Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 2. If the first element in `inp` is less than or equal to `n+1`, then `x` is set to the value of the first element in `inp`. If the first element in `inp` is less than or equal to `n+1` but larger than `n+1`, then `y` is set to the value of the first element in `inp`. If the first element in `inp` is larger than `n+1`, then `x` and `y` are set to the value of the first element in `inp`, and `ans` is set to 1.***
