Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is the second element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1`, otherwise `x` is `n+1`. `y` is `a`. `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1` or if `a` is less than or equal to `a`, otherwise `ans` is 1. `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `inp` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` has been updated to be equal to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the values of `a`, `n`, and `y`, but since `y` is now equal to `a`, the condition for `ans` being 0 or 1 has changed. The input list `inp` and the second element `a` in `inp` are still the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
