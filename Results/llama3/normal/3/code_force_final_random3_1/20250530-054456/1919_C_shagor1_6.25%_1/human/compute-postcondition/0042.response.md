Output State: **n is an integer, x is a if a is less than or equal to n+1, otherwise x is n+1, y is a, ans is 1 if a is less than or equal to n+1 or if a is less than or equal to y, otherwise ans is 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, inp is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in inp.**

The first line checks if `x` is equal to `y`, but since `x` and `y` are not necessarily equal initially, this line does not change any values. The second line assigns the value of `a` to `y`, so `y` becomes `a`. The third line increments `ans` by 1. Since `ans` is initially 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1` or if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, and 1 otherwise, `ans` becomes 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1` or if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, and 2 otherwise. No other variables are affected.
