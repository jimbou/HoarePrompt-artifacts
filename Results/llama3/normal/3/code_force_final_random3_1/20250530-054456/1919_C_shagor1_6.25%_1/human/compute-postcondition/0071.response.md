Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 2. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is equal to `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `x` is equal to `y` which is equal to `a`.***
