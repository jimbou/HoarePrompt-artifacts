Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is the current value of `a`, `y` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one more element after the new value of `x`, `a` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3.***
