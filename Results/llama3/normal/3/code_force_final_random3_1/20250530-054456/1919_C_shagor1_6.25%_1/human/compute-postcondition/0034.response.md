Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is `n+1`, `y` is equal to the first element in `inp`, `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `inp` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `inp`, `a` is larger than `x` and the current value of `a` is less than or equal to `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to the first element in `inp`, which is also the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `a` is larger than `x` and the current value of `a` is less than or equal to `y`, the new value of `y` is also larger than `x` and less than or equal to the original value of `y`.
