Output State: **n is an integer, x is the current value of a, y is the next element in inp after the new value of x, ans is 1, 2 or 3, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, inp is a list with at least one more element after the new value of x, a is the next element in inp after the new value of x**

The first line checks if `x` is equal to `y`, but this comparison does not affect any variables. The second line assigns the value of `a` to `y`, so `y` becomes the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`. The third line increments `ans` by 1, so `ans` becomes 1, 2, or 3. No other variables are affected.
