The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of elements in `inp` minus the number of unique elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to `y`. Here, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`.

Since the exact value of `inp` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the total number of elements in `inp` and the count of unique elements in `inp` that are less than or equal to the second smallest element in `inp`.

Output: **the difference between the total number of elements in inp and the count of unique elements in inp that are less than or equal to the second smallest element in inp**
