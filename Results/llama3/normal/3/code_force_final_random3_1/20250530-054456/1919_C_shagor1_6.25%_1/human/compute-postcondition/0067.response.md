Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is equal to `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to `a`, while the values of `n`, `inp`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
