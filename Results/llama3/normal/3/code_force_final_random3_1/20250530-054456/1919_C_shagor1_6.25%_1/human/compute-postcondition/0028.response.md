Output State: **n is an integer, x is n+1, y is n+1, ans is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `ans`. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, replacing its previous value. The second line assigns the values of the space-separated list of integers to `inp`, but since `inp` is not used in the rest of the code, its value is not relevant to the final state. The third line assigns `n+1` to both `x` and `y`, replacing their previous values. The fourth line assigns 0 to `ans`, replacing its previous value. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
