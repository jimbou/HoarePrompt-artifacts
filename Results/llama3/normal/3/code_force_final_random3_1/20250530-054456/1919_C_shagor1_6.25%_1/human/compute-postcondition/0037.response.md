Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is `n+1`, `y` is either `n+1` or the first element in `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `inp` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `inp` and is larger than `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is set to 1.***
