Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, x is an integer equal to n + 1, y is an integer equal to n + 1, ans is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1` or the first element in `inp`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to the first element in `inp`. If `a` is larger than `x`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is set to 1. If `a` is larger than `y`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `n + 1` or the next element in `inp`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, the first element in `inp`, or the next element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0, 1 or 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one more element after `x`, `a` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `x` is the next element in `inp` after the current value of `x`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, the first element in `inp`, or the next element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one more element after the new value of `x`, `a` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is updated to the next element in `inp`. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `x` remains the current value of `a`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, the state of the variables remains unchanged, otherwise, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
