Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is equal to the first element in `inp`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element in `inp` and the current value of `a` is equal to `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to the first element in `inp`, which is also equal to `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the list `inp` still has at least one element. The relationship between `a` and `x` has been updated to be equal, as `x` is now assigned the value of `a`.
