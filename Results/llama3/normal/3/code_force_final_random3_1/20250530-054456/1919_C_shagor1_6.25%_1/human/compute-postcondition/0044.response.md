Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `x` is the second element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1`, otherwise `x` is `n+1`. `y` is `n+1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1`, otherwise `y` is the second element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `y` is set to `a`. `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1` or if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `ans` is 2. `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `inp` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`.**
