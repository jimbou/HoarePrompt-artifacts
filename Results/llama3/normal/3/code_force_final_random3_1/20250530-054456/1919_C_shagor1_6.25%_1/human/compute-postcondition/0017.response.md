Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer equal to `n + 1` or the next element in `inp`, `y` is an integer equal to `n + 1`, the first element in `inp`, or the next element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0, 1 or 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `inp` is a list with at least one more element after `x`, `a` is the next element in `inp` after the new value of `x`.***
