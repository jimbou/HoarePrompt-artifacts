Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 2, `y` is equal to `a`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `inp`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged. However, a new variable `y` is introduced and assigned the value of `a`. Note that the value of `a` is not specified in the initial state, so `y` is now equal to the unknown value of `a`.
