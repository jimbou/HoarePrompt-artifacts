Output State: **n is an integer, x is the third element in inp if a is less than or equal to n+1, otherwise x is n+1, y is a, ans is 1 if a is less than or equal to n+1 or if a is less than or equal to y, otherwise ans is 2 if a is less than or equal to x, otherwise ans is 3, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, inp is a list that must have at least 3 elements, a is the third element in inp.**

The first line checks if x is equal to y. Since x is the third element in inp if a is less than or equal to n+1, otherwise x is n+1, and y is n+1 if a is less than or equal to n+1, otherwise y is the third element in inp if a is less than or equal to y, otherwise y is set to a, the comparison will be true if a is less than or equal to n+1, and false otherwise. 

The second line assigns the value of a to y. Since a is the third element in inp, y becomes the third element in inp.

The third line increments ans by 1. Since ans is 0 if a is less than or equal to n+1 or if a is less than or equal to y, otherwise ans is 1 if a is less than or equal to x, otherwise ans is 2, ans becomes 1 if a is less than or equal to n+1 or if a is less than or equal to y, otherwise ans is 2 if a is less than or equal to x, otherwise ans is 3.
