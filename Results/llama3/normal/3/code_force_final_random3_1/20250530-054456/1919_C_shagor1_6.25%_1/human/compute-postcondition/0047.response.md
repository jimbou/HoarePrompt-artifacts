Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is the third element in `inp` if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1`, otherwise `x` is `n+1`. `y` is `a`. `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n+1` or if `a` is less than or equal to `a`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `ans` is 2. `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `inp` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `inp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` has been updated to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now determined by the new value of `y`, which is `a`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
