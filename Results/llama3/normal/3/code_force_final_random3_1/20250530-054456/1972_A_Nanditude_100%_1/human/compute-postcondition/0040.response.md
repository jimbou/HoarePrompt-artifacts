Output State: **t is at least 3, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, cnt is 0, and i is 0.**

The code snippet reads three lines from stdin: the first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, the second line assigns a list of `n` non-decreasing integers to `a`, and the third line assigns a list of `n` non-decreasing integers to `b`. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, and the variable `i` is initialized to 0. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
