Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. If the current value of `b[j]` is not less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2. In both cases, `b[j]` is not less than `a[i-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` is still at least 1, the value of `_` is still 0, and there are still multiple test cases minus one in the standard input. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than 2, and the lists `a` and `b` are still lists of `n` non-decreasing integers. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2, depending on the previous value of `b[j]` compared to `a[i]`. The value of `j` is still 2, and `b[j]` is still not less than `a[i-1]`.
