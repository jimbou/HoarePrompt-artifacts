Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, i is 0, and j is n-1. Otherwise, if the previous value of cnt was equal to the number of iterations of the loop minus one, then cnt is equal to the number of iterations of the loop minus one, i is 1, and j is n-1. Otherwise, cnt is equal to the number of iterations of the loop minus two, i is increased by one, and j is n-1, with the condition that b[j] is not less than a[i-1].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate n times, where n is the length of the lists a and b. After the loop finishes executing, the value of cnt will be equal to the number of iterations of the loop if the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i]. If the previous value of cnt was equal to the number of iterations of the loop minus one, then cnt will be equal to the number of iterations of the loop minus one. Otherwise, cnt will be equal to the number of iterations of the loop minus two, and i will be increased by one, with the condition that b[j] is not less than a[i-1]. The values of t, _, stdin, n, a, and b remain unchanged.
