Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If the current value of `b[j]` is not less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. In both cases, `b[j]` is not less than `a[i-1]`.***
