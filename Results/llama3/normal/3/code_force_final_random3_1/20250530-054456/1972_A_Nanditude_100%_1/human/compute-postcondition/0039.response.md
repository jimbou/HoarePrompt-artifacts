The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is at least 3, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, and cnt which is the number of iterations of the loop minus two, one, or the number of iterations of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the initial state is being printed**
