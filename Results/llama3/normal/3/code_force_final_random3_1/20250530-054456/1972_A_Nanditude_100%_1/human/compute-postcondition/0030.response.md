Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is 1, with the condition that `b[j]` is not less than `a[i-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `cnt`, `i`, and `j` are still dependent on the comparison between `b[j]` and `a[i]`, but now `i` has a new value.
