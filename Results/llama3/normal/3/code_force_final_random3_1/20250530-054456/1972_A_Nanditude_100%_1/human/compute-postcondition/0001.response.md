The only variable in the loop head is variable `t` and `_`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**
