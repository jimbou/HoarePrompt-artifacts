Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt` being equal to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `b[j]` is still less than the current value of `a[i]`, and the rest of the conditions in the initial state are still valid.
