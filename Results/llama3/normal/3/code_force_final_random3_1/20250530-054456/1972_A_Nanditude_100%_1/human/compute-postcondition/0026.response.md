Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `cnt` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is not less than `a[i-1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `b[j]` and `a[i]` is now `b[j]` is not less than `a[i-1]`, since `i` has been incremented. The rest of the conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
