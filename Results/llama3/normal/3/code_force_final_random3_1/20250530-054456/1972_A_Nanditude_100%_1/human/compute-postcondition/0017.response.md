Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, cnt is the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a that is not less than the first element in b, i is the index of the first element in a that is not less than the first element in b, j is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains at least 1.
- The value of `_` remains 0.
- The value of `stdin` remains multiple test cases minus one.
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer.
- The value of `a` remains a list of `n` non-decreasing integers.
- The value of `b` remains a list of `n` non-decreasing integers.
- The value of `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is not less than the first element in `b`.
- The value of `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the first element in `b`.
- The value of `j` is `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `b`.
