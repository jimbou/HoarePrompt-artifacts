Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1, and `b[j]` is not less than the second element of the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is now 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
