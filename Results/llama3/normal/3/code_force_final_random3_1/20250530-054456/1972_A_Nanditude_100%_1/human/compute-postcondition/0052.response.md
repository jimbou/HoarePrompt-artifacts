Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2, and `b[j]` is not less than the second element of the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is now 3, and `i` and `j` remain 0 and 2, respectively. Otherwise, `cnt` is now 1, and `i` and `j` remain 1 and 2, respectively, with `b[j]` being not less than the second element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
