To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already a positive integer that must be at least 1, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust `j` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
