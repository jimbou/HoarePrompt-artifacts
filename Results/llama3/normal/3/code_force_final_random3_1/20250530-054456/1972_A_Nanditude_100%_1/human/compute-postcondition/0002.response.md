Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, cnt is 0, i is 0**

The code reads three lines from stdin for each test case. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` non-decreasing integers to `a`. The third line assigns a list of `n` non-decreasing integers to `b`. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0 and `i` is initialized to 0. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
