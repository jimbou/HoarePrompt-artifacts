To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `j` is the loop variable, it should start at 0 for the loop to execute. 

State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, cnt is 0, i is 0, j is 0**
