Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and two lists of n non-decreasing integers, a and b. It then counts the number of elements in b that are less than the current element in a, and prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the results directly to standard output.**
