Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 2, i is 0, and j is 1. If the current value of b[j] is not less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 1, i is 1, and j is 1. In both cases, b[j] is not less than a[i-1].**
