Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and `b[j]` is not less than the second element of the list `a`. `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `cnt`, `j`, and the relationship between `a` and `b` are still valid, but now `i` is 1.
