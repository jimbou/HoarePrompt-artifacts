Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `cnt` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is not less than `a[i-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a[i-1]` and `b[j]` is still valid, but the relationship between `a[i]` and `b[j]` is not guaranteed to be valid anymore.
