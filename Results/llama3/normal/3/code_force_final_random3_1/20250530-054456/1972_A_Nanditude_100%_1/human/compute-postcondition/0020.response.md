The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, cnt is the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a that is not less than the first element in b, i is the index of the first element in a that is not less than the first element in b, j is n, and the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a that is not less than the first element in b, which is cnt, is being printed**
