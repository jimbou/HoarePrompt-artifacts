Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, cnt is the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a that is not less than the first element in b, i is the index of the first element in a that is not less than the first element in b, j is n, and the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a that is not less than the first element in b, which is cnt, is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, and cnt which is the number of iterations of the loop minus two, one, or the number of iterations of the loop, depending on the conditions described in the initial state is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 3, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, cnt is a non-negative integer, i is n, and j is n, and the value of cnt which is a non-negative integer is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
