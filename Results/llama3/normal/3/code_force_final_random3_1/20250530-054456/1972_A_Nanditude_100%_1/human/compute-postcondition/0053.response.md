Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2, and `b[j]` is not less than the second element of the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 3, and the value of `_` is still 2. The number of test cases in stdin is still multiple minus one. The value of `n` is still a positive integer that must be at least 2. The list `a` still contains `n` non-decreasing integers, and the list `b` still contains `n` non-decreasing integers. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2, `i` is now 1, and `j` is still 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is now 2, and `j` is still 2, and `b[j]` is not less than the second element of the list `a`.
