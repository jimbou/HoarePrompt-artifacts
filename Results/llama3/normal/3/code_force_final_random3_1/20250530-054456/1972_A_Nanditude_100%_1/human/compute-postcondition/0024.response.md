Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be at least 1, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers, cnt is 1, i is 0, j is 0, and the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of cnt has been incremented by 1, and it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The current value of b[j] is still less than the current value of a[i].
