Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now contains only two lines instead of three. The first line of each test case contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n, and the second line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n.
