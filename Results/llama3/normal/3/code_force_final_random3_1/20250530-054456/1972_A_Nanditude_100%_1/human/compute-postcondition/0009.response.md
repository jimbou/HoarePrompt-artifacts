According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 1, i is 0, and j is 1. Otherwise, cnt is 0, i is increased by 1, and j is 1, and b[j] is not less than a[i-1]**
