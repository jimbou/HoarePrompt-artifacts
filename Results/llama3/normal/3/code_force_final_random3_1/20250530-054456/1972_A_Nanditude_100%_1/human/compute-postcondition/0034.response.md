Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, if the previous value of `cnt` was 1, then `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is 2, with the condition that `b[j]` is not less than `a[i-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains at least 2, and the value of `_` remains 1. The number of test cases in stdin is still multiple minus one. The number of elements `n` in lists `a` and `b` remains a positive integer that must be at least 1. Lists `a` and `b` still contain non-decreasing integers. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and its new value depends on the previous values of `cnt`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `j` remains 2. The value of `cnt` depends on the previous values of `cnt`, `a`, and `b`.
