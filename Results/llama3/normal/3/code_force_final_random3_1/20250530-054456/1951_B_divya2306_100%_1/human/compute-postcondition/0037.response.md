Functionality: **The function determines the maximum number of wins a cow can achieve in a competition, given its rating and the ratings of other cows. It takes as input the number of cows, the index of the cow, and the ratings of all cows. The function then calculates the number of wins the cow can achieve without swapping its rating with any other cow, and the number of wins it can achieve if it swaps its rating with the cow at the next higher rating. The function prints the maximum of these two values, minus one if the cow's original rating is not the highest, and returns nothing.**
