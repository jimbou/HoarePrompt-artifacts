Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `a[i]` is still greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`.
