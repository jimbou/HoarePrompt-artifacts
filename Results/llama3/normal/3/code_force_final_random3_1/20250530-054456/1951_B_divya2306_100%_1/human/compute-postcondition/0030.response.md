To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `wins + 2` and less than or equal to `k - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

`win_with_swap` is `wins + 3`, which is a constant expression, so its value does not change.

`k` is an integer, and its value does not change.

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be greater than or equal to `wins + 3` and less than or equal to `k - 1`.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `wins + 3` and less than or equal to `k - 1`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is less than `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 3**
