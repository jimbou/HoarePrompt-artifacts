Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `wins + 2` and less than or equal to `k - 1`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is less than `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 2`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
