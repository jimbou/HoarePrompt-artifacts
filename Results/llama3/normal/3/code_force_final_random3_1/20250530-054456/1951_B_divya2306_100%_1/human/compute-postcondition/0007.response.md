Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, and `wins` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1.
