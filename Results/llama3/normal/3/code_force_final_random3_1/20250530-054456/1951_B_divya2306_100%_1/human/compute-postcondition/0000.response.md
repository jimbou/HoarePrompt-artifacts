Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, wins is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

The code reads two lines from stdin for each test case. The first line assigns the number of cows (n) and the index of the cow (k) as integers. The second line assigns a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows to the variable 'a'. The variable 'wins' is initialized to 0. After executing this code, stdin will contain one less test case.
