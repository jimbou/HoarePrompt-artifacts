Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, `wins` is less than `k`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    win_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `wins + 1` and less than or equal to `k - 2`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is less than `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 2`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `wins + 2` and less than or equal to `k - 1`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is less than `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 3`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `wins + 3` and less than or equal to `k - 1`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is less than `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 4`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
