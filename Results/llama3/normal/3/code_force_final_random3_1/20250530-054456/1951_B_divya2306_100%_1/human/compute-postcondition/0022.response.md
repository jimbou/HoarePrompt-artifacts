Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `win_with_swap` and less than or equal to `k - 2`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is less than `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`.**
