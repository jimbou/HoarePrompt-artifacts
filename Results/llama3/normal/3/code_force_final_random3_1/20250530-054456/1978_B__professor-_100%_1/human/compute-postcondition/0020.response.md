The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer value.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing three integers, and the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is being printed**
