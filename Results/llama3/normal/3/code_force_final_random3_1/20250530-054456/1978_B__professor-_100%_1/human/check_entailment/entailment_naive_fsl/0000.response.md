Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. It considers three cases:

1. If the modified price (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price, resulting in a profit of n * a.

2. If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (b - a) is greater than or equal to the number of buns (n), it's optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program calculates the profit by selling the first (b - a) buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price. The profit is the sum of the profit from the modified price buns, calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2, and the profit from the remaining buns, which is a * n.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the maximum profit accordingly.
