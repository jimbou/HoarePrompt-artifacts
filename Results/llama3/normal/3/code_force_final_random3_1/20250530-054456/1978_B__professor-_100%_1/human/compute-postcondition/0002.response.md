The code reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively. Since stdin contains `t` lines of input, after executing this code, there will be `t-1` lines of input left in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing three integers**
