Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each line containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` is printed.***
