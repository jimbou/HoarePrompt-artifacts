Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing three integers. The current value of `b` is less than or equal to the current value of `a`, and the product of `n` and `a` is being printed, which is a value between 1 and 10^18**
