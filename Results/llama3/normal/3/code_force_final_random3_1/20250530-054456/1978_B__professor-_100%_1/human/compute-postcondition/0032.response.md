The code prints the value of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` which is an integer, where `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers assigned from the input.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each line containing three integers, and this is printed: `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`**
