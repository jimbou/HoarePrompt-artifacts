The code prints the result of the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, where `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing three integers, and the result of the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` is being printed**
