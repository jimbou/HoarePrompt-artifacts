Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing three integers, `b` is larger than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, and this is printed: the sum of the series from `a` to `b` (inclusive) plus the product of `a` and `n`, where the sum of the series is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series with `b - a + 1` terms, first term `a`, and last term `b`.**
