The code prints the result of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which is an integer.

Here's a breakdown of the variables and their values:

*   `t`: an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (not used in the expression)
*   `n`, `a`, and `b`: integers assigned from the input (their exact values are not specified)
*   `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`: calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `b - a + 1` terms, starting from `a` and ending at `b`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which discards the fractional part and returns an integer.
*   `+ a * n`: adds the product of `a` and `n` to the result of the previous calculation

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result.

Output: **(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n (where n, a, and b are the values assigned from the input)**
