Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t, and each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b. It then calculates and prints the sum of a sequence of numbers based on the values of n, a, and b, considering three different cases: when b is less than or equal to a, when b minus a is greater than or equal to n, and when b minus a is less than n. After processing all input lines, the function leaves stdin empty and t as 0.**
