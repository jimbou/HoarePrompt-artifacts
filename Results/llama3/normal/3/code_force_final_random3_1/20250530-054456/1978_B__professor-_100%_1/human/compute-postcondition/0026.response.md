Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each line containing three integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, but `n`, `a`, and `b` are now assigned the values of the three integers from the first line of input. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines of input, each line containing three integers.
