The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed. Otherwise, the result of the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` is printed.**
