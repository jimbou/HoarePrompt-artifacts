The code prints the result of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which is an integer value.

Here's a breakdown of the variables and their values:

*   `b - a`: This is the difference between `b` and `a`, which is an integer between 1 and `n-1` (since `b` is larger than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`).
*   `(b - a) * (b - a + 1)`: This is the product of the difference between `b` and `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` plus one. This is an integer value.
*   `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`: This is the result of the previous expression divided by 2, using integer division (i.e., the result is truncated to an integer). This is an integer value.
*   `a * n`: This is the product of `a` and `n`, which is an integer value.

The final expression is the sum of the last two expressions, which is also an integer value.

Output: **(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n (where b - a is the difference between b and a, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and n is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
