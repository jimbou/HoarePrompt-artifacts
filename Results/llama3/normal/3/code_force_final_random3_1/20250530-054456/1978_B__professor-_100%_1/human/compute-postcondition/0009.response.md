The code prints the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer.
Since `b` is larger than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, we can deduce that `b` is at least `a + n`.
Substituting this into the expression, we get `(2 * (a + n) - n + 1) * n // 2`, which simplifies to `(2a + n + 1) * n // 2`.
This expression represents the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `2a + 1` and the common difference is `1`.
Therefore, the output is the sum of this arithmetic series.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing three integers, `b` is larger than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the sum of the arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `2a + 1` and the common difference is `1` is being printed**
