The code prints the calculated value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, where `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Since the exact values of `b` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 (where b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between b and a is greater than or equal to n)**
