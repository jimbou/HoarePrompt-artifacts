Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is larger than `a`, then if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum of the arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `2a + 1` and the common difference is `1` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the series from `a` to `b` (inclusive) plus the product of `a` and `n` is printed, where the sum of the series is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series with `b - a + 1` terms, first term `a`, and last term `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed. Otherwise, the result of the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each line containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
