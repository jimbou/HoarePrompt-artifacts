Based on the precondition, we can determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

The precondition states that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers assigned the values of the three integers from the input, and `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1. However, the value of `t` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is `print(n * a)`. This statement will print the product of the values of `n` and `a`.

Since `n` and `a` are integers assigned from the input, we can't determine their exact values without knowing the specific input. However, we can describe their values based on the precondition.

`n` is an integer assigned from the input, and `a` is also an integer assigned from the input.

Therefore, the `print` statement will print the product of these two integers, `n` and `a`.

Output: **the product of n and a (where n and a are integers assigned from the input)**
