The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` accepts a line of input from stdin, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains `t` lines of input, each line containing three integers, the first line of input is consumed and assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The remaining `t-1` lines of input are still in stdin.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers read from the first line of input. The range of these values is not specified, but they are integers.

The value of `t` is not affected by this code, so it remains an integer between 0 and 10^4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing three integers.**
