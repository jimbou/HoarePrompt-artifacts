The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer.
In this expression, `b` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `//` denotes integer division (i.e., rounding down to the nearest whole number).
Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, and `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression without knowing the specific values of `n` and `b`.
However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression, which is an integer.
Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 (where n and b are the values of the variables n and b)**
