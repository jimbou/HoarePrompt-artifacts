Output State: **k is an integer, a and b are non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), ans is an integer equal to k * b + (n - k) * a.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `ans` is introduced and its value is calculated based on the given formula, which takes into account the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. The final value of `ans` is the sum of two products: `k` multiplied by `b` and `n-k` multiplied by `a`.
