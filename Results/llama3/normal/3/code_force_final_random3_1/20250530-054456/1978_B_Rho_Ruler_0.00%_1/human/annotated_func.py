#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer, a and b are non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b).
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the total cost (ans) is less than or equal to the maximum possible cost (n * max(a, b)), where ans is the total cost calculated as k * b + (n - k) * a, and max(a, b) is the maximum of the two non-negative integers a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and compares the total cost of two different scenarios, returning True if the total cost is less than or equal to the maximum possible cost, and False otherwise.
