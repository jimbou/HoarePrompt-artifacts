Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit. The function `func_1` is used to determine whether the current value of k is optimal or not.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet. It is unclear what this function does or how it determines whether the current value of k is optimal.

2. The program is using a binary search approach, but it is not clear why this is necessary. The problem can be solved using a simple mathematical formula to calculate the maximum profit.

3. The program is printing the value of `ans`, which is the optimal value of k, but the problem asks for the maximum profit, not the optimal value of k.

4. The program does not handle the case where `a` is greater than `b`. In this case, the maximum profit is simply `n * a`, and the program should return this value.

5. The program does not handle the case where `n` is 0. In this case, the maximum profit is 0, and the program should return this value.

6. The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are both 0. In this case, the maximum profit is 0, and the program should return this value.

7. The program does not handle the case where `a` is 0 and `b` is not 0. In this case, the maximum profit is `n * b`, and the program should return this value.

8. The program does not handle the case where `b` is 0 and `a` is not 0. In this case, the maximum profit is `n * a`, and the program should return this value.

Correctness: **False**
