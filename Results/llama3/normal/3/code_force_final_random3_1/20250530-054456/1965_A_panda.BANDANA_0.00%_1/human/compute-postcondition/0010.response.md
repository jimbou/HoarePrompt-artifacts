The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of `n` positive integers, `e` is a set of `n` positive integers, `m` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` and then a space-separated list of `n` integers. If the list `l` contains the number 1, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**
