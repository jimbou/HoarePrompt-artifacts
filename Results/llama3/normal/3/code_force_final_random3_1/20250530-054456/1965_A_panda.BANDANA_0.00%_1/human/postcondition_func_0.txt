This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers. It then checks if the number 1 is present in the list. If 1 is found, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding result for each case.
