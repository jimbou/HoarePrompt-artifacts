Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is a positive integer, l is a list of n positive integers, e is a set of n positive integers, m is equal to n, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a space-separated list of n integers. If the list l contains the number 1, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**
