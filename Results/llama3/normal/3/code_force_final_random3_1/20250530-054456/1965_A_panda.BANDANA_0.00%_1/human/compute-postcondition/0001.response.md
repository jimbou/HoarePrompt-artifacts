To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. Since `t` is a positive integer and the loop iterates over the range of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we need to set its initial value to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a space-separated list of n integers. n is a positive integer, and the integers in the list are positive integers.**
