The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a space-separated list of n integers. t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, and the integers in the list are positive integers. The first input is an integer t, which is assigned to the variable t. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a space-separated list of n integers. n is a positive integer, and the integers in the list are positive integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a space-separated list of n integers. n is a positive integer, and the integers in the list are positive integers.**
