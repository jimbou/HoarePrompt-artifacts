Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, i is t-1, n is a positive integer, l is a list of n positive integers, e is a set of n positive integers, m is equal to n, stdin contains 0 test cases. If 1 is in the list l, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be the same as it was initially (a positive integer), `i` will be one less than `t`, `n` will be a positive integer, `l` will be a list of `n` positive integers, `e` will be a set of `n` positive integers, and `m` will be equal to `n`. Additionally, there will be no more test cases left in the standard input (`stdin`), and the program will print either 'Bob' or 'Alice' depending on whether the list `l` contains the number 1.
