Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The current implementation only checks if 1 is in the list of pile sizes, and if so, it prints 'Bob'. However, this is not sufficient to determine the winner.

A counterexample is when the list of pile sizes is [2, 2, 2]. In this case, the program will print 'Alice', but the correct answer is 'Bob'. This is because Alice can only remove 1 stone from each pile on her first turn, leaving [1, 1, 1], and then Bob can remove 1 stone from each pile on his turn, winning the game.

The correct solution involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the pile sizes and checking if it is 1. If the GCD is 1, then Alice can always make a move that leaves a pile size of 1, forcing Bob to lose. If the GCD is greater than 1, then Bob can always make a move that leaves a pile size of 1, forcing Alice to lose.
