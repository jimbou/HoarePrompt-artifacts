Output State: **`count` is 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1, and `s[k]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is increased by 1, so it can be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `count` being 1 or 2 is still dependent on the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`. If either of them is '?' or they are equal, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1, and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not '?' and not equal to each other.
