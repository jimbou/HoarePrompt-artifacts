Output State: **`count` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input buffer still contains `t-1` strings, each with lowercase letters and/or question marks, and lengths between 1 and 5000. The list `s` still holds characters from the first string. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are also unchanged, with `n` being at least 5, `j` being `n // 2 - 2`, and `k` being `n // 2 - 1`.
