Postcondition: **`count` is 0, 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, if `s[k]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 0. In all other cases, `count` is 1.**
