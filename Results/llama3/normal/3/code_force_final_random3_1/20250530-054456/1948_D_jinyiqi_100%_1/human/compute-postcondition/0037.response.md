The value of `count` is reset to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The value of `n` is still at least 2, and `j` is still `n // 2 - 1`. The value of `k` is still 2.
