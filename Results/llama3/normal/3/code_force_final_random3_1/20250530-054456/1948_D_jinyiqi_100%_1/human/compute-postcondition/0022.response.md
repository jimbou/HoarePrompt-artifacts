Output State: **`count` is 0 or a multiple of `j`, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2, k is n - j.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the count is either 0 or a multiple of j, and the other variables remain unchanged. The count is 0 if the loop iterates n - j times without finding a match, and it's a multiple of j if the loop finds a match and the count reaches j. The stdin, s, n, and j remain the same as in the initial state.
