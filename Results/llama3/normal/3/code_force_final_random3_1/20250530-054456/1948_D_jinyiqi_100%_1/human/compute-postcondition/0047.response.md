Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is either '?' or `s[k + j]` is either '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, and neither `s[k]` nor `s[k + j]` is a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.***
