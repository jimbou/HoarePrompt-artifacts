Output State: **`count` is 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2, `n - j` is at least 1, k is 1**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it can be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each with the specified characteristics. The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are still the same, with `n` being at least 2, `j` being half of `n`, and `k` being 1.
