The only objects in the loop head are variables  k, n and j, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `n` and `j`. If `k` is less than `n - j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `n - j` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n - j` must be at least 2.
State: **`count` is 0, 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2, `n - j` is at least 2, k is 1**
