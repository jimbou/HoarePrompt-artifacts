Output State: **`count` is 1, 2, or 3, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 strings with the specified properties.
