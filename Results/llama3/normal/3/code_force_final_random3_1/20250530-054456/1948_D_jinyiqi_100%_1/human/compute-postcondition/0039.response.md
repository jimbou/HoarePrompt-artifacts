Output State: **`count` is 0 or a multiple of j, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`.**

The loop will execute until `k` reaches `n - j`, at which point it will terminate. The value of `count` will be either 0 or a multiple of `j`, depending on the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` during each iteration. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is a question mark, `count` will be incremented. Otherwise, `count` will remain 0. The state of the other variables, including `stdin`, `s`, `n`, and `j`, remains unchanged.
