Output State: **`count` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2 - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings, each with the specified characteristics. The list `s` remains a list of characters from the first string, and the values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are still as initially defined.
