Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `s[k]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
