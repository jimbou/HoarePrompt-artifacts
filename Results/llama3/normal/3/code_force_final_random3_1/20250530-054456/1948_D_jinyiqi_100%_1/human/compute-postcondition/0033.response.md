Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2 - 1, k is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables, including `stdin`, `s`, `n`, `j`, and `k`, remain unchanged. The conditions that were previously true, such as `s[k]` not being equal to `s[k + j]` and neither of them being equal to '?', are no longer relevant because `count` has been reset to 0.
