Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2 - 1, k is n - (n // 2 - 1)**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0. The values of the other variables, including `stdin`, `s`, `n`, `j`, and `k`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each with the specified characteristics. The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are still related by the equations j = n // 2 - 1 and k = n - (n // 2 - 1), and `n` is still at least 2.
