Output State: **`count` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The value of `n` is still at least 4, and the values of `j` and `k` are still `n // 2 - 2` and `n - (n // 2 - 2)`, respectively.
