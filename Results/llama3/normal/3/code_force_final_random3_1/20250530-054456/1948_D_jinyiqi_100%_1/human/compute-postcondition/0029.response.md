Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2 - 1, k is 0, and s[k] is not equal to '?' and s[k + j] is not equal to '?' and s[k] is not equal to s[k + j]**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code `count = 0` only reassigns the value of `count` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, none of the other variables are affected, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.
