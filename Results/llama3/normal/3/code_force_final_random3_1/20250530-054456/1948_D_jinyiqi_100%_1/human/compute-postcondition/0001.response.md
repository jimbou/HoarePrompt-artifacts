To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n // 2` is greater than 0. Since `n` is the length of the first string, we can adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2 (because `n // 2` needs to be at least 1). We can also adjust the state of `j` to be `n // 2` since that's the starting value of the loop.

State: **stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2**
