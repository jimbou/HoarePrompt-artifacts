To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k`, `n`, and `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - j`. If `n - j` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `n` is at least 2 and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, we can deduce that `n - j` is at least 1.

So, for the loop to execute, `k` must be 0 (since it starts from 0), `n` must be at least 2, and `j` must be `n // 2 - 1`.

State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2 - 1, k is 0**
