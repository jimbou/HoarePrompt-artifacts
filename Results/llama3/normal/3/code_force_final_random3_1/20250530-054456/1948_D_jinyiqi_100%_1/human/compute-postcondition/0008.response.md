Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 or 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2, `n - j` is at least 1, k is 0. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, and `s[k]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.***
