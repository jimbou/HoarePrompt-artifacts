Output State: **`count` is either 1 or 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it can be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` also remain the same, with `n` being at least 5, `j` being `n // 2 - 2`, and `k` being `n // 2 - 1`.
