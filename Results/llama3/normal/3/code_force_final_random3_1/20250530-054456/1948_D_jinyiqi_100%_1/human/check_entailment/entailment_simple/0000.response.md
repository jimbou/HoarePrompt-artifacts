Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the input string, and converts it into a list of characters. It then iterates over the possible lengths of the tandem repeat from the longest to the shortest. For each length, it checks if there is a substring of that length that can be made into a tandem repeat by replacing the question marks.

The program uses a sliding window approach to check for the tandem repeat. It maintains a count of the number of matching characters in the current window. If the count becomes equal to the length of the window, it means that a tandem repeat of that length has been found, and the program prints the length of the tandem repeat and returns.

If no tandem repeat is found for any length, the program prints 0.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input string is too short to contain a tandem repeat or when the input string does not contain any question marks.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
