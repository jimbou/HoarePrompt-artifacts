Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 2. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is a question mark, then `count` is incremented. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
