Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2**

In this output state, a new variable `count` is introduced and initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each with the specified characteristics. The list `s` still contains characters from the first string, and the values of `n` and `j` remain the same, with `j` being half of `n`.
