Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, 1, 2 or 3, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2, `n - j` is at least 2, k is 1. If `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]` and neither `s[k]` nor `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is 0. Otherwise, `count` is 1, 2 or 3.***
