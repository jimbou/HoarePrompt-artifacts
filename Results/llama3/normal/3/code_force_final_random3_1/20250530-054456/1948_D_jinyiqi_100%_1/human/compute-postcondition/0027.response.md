Output State: **`count` is 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2 - 1, k is 0. The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'**

The code increments the value of `count` by 1, so it changes from 0 to 1. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
