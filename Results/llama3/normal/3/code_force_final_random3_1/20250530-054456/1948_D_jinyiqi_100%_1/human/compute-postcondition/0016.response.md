Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is n // 2, `n - j` is at least 1, k is 1**

The code sets the value of `count` to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The value of `n` is still at least 2, `j` is still `n // 2`, `n - j` is still at least 1, and `k` is still 1.
