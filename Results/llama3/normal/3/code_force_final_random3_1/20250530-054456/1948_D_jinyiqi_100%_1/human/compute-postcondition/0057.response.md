Output State: **`count` is 0 or a multiple of `j`, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `count` will either be 0 or a multiple of the current value of `j` (which will be 1 at the end of the loop), the input state remains unchanged with `t-1` strings in `stdin`, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks with lengths between 1 and 5000, the list `s` remains unchanged as a list of characters from the first string, the length of the string `n` is at least 2, the loop counter `j` will have reached 1 (since it decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1), and the inner loop counter `k` will be `n - 1` after the last iteration of the outer loop.
