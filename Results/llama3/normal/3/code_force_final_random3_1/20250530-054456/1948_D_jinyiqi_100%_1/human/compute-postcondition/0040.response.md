The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` is `n // 2 - 2`. Since `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`count` is 0 or a multiple of `n // 2 - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`**
