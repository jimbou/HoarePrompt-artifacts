Output State: **`count` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0. The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or the current value of `s[k + j]` is either '?' or the current value of `s[k]` is equal to the current value of `s[k + j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings, each with the same characteristics as before. The list `s` remains the same, and the values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged. The relationship between the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` also remains the same.
