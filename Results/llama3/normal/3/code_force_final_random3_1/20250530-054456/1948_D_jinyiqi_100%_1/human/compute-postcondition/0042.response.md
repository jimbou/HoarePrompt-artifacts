To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k`, `n`, and `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - j` is greater than 0. Since `n` is at least 4 and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, we can adjust the state of `n` and `j` to ensure `n - j` is greater than 0.

State: **`count` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0**
