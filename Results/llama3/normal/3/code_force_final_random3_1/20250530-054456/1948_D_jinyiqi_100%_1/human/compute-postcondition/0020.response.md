Output State: **`count` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `n - j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive)**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each with the specified characteristics.
