Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1], resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths), ps is p[ps - 1], paths is a list containing a[ps - 1] repeated ps - 1 times, resb is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1] that must have at least 1 element, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of preb plus the value of pathb[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is 0, ps is p[ps - 1], paths is a list containing a[ps - 1] repeated ps - 1 times, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, preb is the value of its original value plus the value of pathb[i], pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i]. If k is less than i plus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1] that must have at least 2 elements, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of preb plus the value of pathb[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is 1, ps is p[ps - 1], paths is a list containing a[ps - 1] repeated ps - 1 times, preb is the value of its original value plus the value of pathb[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, p is an integer, a is an integer or a list of integers, vis is an integer or a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, resb is the maximum of its original value and (preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)), curr is preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), pres is an integer, ress is an integer, i is an integer, ps is an integer, paths is an integer or a list of integers, and preb is preb + pathb[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
