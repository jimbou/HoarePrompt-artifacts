Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the maximum values calculated from the input test cases.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input test cases, including the four integers `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`, and the two lists of integers `p` and `a`.

2. It correctly initializes the `pathb` and `paths` lists to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

3. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating through the `pathb` and `paths` lists and calculating the maximum values.

4. It correctly compares the maximum values for Bodya and Sasha and outputs the correct result, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the maximum values for Bodya and Sasha are equal, outputting 'Draw' in this case.

6. The program correctly continues to execute until all test cases have been processed, producing a series of output strings indicating the winner or a draw for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input test cases.

Correctness: **True**
