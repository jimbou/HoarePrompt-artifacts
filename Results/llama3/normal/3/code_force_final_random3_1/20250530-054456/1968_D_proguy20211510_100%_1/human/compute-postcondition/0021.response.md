Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer equal to p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing multiple integer values a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], ..., a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], paths is a list containing the integer value a[ps - 1], vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (ps - 1)th index which is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional block.
