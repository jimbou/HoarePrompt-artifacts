Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `vis` is a list of integers with `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` equal to 1, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `ps` is an integer, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `curr` is the value of `pres` plus the value of `paths[i]` times the value of `k` minus `i`, `pres` is the value of its original value plus the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their original values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
