Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game or a draw based on the maximum values calculated from the input test cases. The function accepts multiple test cases from the input, each containing four integers and two lists of integers. It processes each test case, calculating the maximum values for 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', and outputs 'Bodya' if the maximum value for 'Bodya' is greater, 'Sasha' if the maximum value for 'Sasha' is greater, or 'Draw' if the maximum values are equal. The function continues to execute until all test cases have been processed, producing a series of output strings indicating the winner or a draw for each test case.**
