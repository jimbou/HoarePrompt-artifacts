Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer equal to p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing multiple integer values a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], ..., a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], paths is a list containing the integer values a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], ..., a[ps - 1], vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (ps - 1)th index which is 1, resb is 0, ress is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], resb is the maximum value between its original value and curr.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: curr is updated to preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is updated to preb + pathb[i], resb is updated to the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is either increased by 1 or remains the same depending on the value of k, len(pathb) is greater than the new value of i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: curr is updated to preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is updated to preb + pathb[i], resb is updated to the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
