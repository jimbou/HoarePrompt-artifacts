Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb)), paths is a list of paths that must have at least len(pathb) paths. If resb is greater than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If ress is greater than resb, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, n, k, pb, p, a, vis remain unchanged, ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1, paths is a list that must have at least len(paths) elements, pathb must have at least len(pathb) + len(paths) - 1 elements, i is len(paths) - 1. If resb is greater than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If ress is greater than resb, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed and ress is less than or equal to resb.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, k, pb, p, a, vis, pathb, resb, ps, preb, i, curr, pres, ress, and paths are unchanged. If resb is higher than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If ress is higher than resb, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
