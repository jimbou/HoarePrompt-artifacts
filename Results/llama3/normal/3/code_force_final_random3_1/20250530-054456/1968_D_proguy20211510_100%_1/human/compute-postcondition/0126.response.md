Postcondition: ***`resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `curr` is the value of `pres` plus the value of `paths[i]` times the value of `k` minus `i`, `pres` is the value of its original value plus the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis` remain unchanged, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `pathb` must have at least `len(pathb)` elements, `i` is 1. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
