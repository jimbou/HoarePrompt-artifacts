Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with vis[p[pb - 1] - 1] equal to 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, ps is an integer, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths)**

The code block modifies the values of `pathb` and `pb`. The first line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to `pathb`, adding a new element to the list. The second line updates the value of `pb` to `p[pb - 1]`, changing the value of `pb` to the value at index `pb - 1` in the list `p`. No other variables are affected by the code block.
