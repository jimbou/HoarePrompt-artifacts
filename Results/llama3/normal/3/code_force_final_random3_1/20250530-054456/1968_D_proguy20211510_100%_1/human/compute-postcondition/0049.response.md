Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `preb` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values, `i` is 0, `paths` is a list of paths that must have at least 1 path, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, and `paths` remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `k` is still less than the current value of `i` plus 1.
