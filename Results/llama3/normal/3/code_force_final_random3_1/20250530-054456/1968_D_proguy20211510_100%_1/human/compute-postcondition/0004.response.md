The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `pathb`. Since `a` is a list of integers and `pb` is an integer, this operation adds a single integer value to the list `pathb`. The second line assigns the value of `p[pb - 1]` to `pb`. Since `p` is a list of integers and `pb` is an integer, this operation updates the value of `pb` to another integer value.

Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a single integer value a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (pb-1)th index which is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 lines of input**
