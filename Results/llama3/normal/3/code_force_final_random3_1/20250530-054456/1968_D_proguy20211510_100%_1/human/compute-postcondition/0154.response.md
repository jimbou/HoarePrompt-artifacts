Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with vis[p[pb - 1] - 1] equal to 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, ps is an integer, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths)**

Explanation:
The first line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to `pathb`. Since `pathb` already contains `a[pb - 1]`, it now contains two copies of the same value. The second line assigns the value of `p[pb - 1]` to `pb`. This means that `pb` now points to the parent of its original value. As a result, `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` is equal to 1, indicating that the parent of the original `pb` has been visited. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
