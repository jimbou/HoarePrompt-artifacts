Output State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0), preb is the sum of its original value and a[pb - 1], i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb), n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], and a[p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1.**

The code snippet does not modify any variables except for the list `vis`. The first line initializes `vis` as a list of `n` zeros, and the second line sets the `ps-1`th element of `vis` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their original values as described in the initial state.
