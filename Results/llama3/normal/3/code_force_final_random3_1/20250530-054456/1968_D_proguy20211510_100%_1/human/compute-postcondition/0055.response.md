Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `preb` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values, `i` is 1, `paths` is a list of paths that must have at least 2 paths. If `k` is less than `i` + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`. The value of `curr` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`). The value of `preb` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values. The value of `i` remains 1. The list of paths `paths` remains unchanged, with at least 2 paths. If `k` is less than `i` + 1, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
