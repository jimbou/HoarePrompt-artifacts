Output State: **resb is 0, ress is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0, curr, i, n, k, pb, p, a, pathb, and vis remain unchanged, and ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1, and paths is updated by appending the values of a[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.**

The code initializes two pairs of variables, `resb` and `ress`, and `preb` and `pres`, all to 0. The rest of the variables, including `curr`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `vis`, remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, and the value of `paths` is updated by appending the values of `a[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1.
