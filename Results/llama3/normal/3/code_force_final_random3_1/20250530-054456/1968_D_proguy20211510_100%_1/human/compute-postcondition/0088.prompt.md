Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb), n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0), `preb` is the sum of its original value and `a[pb - 1]`, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `len(pathb)`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the `pb-1`th element set to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0), `preb` is the sum of its original value and `a[pb - 1]`, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `len(pathb)`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` and `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the `p[pb - 1]-1`th element set to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0), `preb` is the sum of its original value and `a[pb - 1]`, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `len(pathb)`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the `p[p[pb - 1]-1]`th element set to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
