Postcondition: ***YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing two integer values a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (p[pb - 1] - 1)th index which is 1. If the (pb - 1)th index of vis is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
