Output State: **vis[ps - 1] is 1, then resb, curr, preb, i, n, k, pb, ps, p, a, pathb, and paths remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If vis[ps - 1] is not 1, then paths is updated by appending the value of a[ps - 1], and ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

If the value at index `ps - 1` in the `vis` list is 1, then all variables (`resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths`) remain unchanged, and the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.

However, if the value at index `ps - 1` in the `vis` list is not 1, then the `paths` list is updated by appending the value at index `ps - 1` in the `a` list, and the value of `ps` is updated to the value at index `ps - 1` in the `p` list.
