Postcondition: ***`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0), `preb` is the sum of its original value and `a[pb - 1]`, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `len(pathb)`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` and `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the `p[pb - 1]-1`th element set to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
