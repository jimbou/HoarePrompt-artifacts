Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1], resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths), ps is p[ps - 1], paths is a list containing a[ps - 1] repeated ps - 1 times, resb is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0.**

The code initializes the variables `resb`, `preb`, and `pres` to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The loop does not execute because the condition `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, which breaks the loop. Therefore, the variables `ps` and `paths` are not updated. The final state of the variables is a combination of their initial values and the changes made by the code.
