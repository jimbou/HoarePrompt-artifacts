Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer equal to p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing multiple integer values a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], ..., a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], paths is a list containing the integer values a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], ..., a[ps - 1], vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (ps - 1)th index which is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that the list 'paths' will contain multiple integer values a[ps - 1] repeated multiple times, depending on the number of iterations of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
