Postcondition: **The program's state is updated based on the value of `vis[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.**
