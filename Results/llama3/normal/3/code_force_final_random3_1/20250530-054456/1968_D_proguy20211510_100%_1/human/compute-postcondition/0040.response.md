Postcondition: ***`curr`, `preb`, `resb` are updated based on their original values and the values of `pathb[i]` and `k`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated and `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. In all cases, `len(pathb)` is greater than the new value of `i`.***
