According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `paths`. If the list has at least 1 path the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb)). So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 path and the i is 0.
State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is 0, paths is a list of paths that must have at least 1 path**
