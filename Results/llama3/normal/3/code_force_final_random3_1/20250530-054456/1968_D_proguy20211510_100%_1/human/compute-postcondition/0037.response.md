Output State: **curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], resb is the maximum value between its original value and curr.**

The first line calculates a new value for `curr` by adding the product of `pathb[i]` and `(k - i)` to `preb`. This new value is compared with the original value of `curr`, and the maximum of the two is assigned to `curr`. The second line increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. The third line compares the original value of `resb` with the new value of `curr` and assigns the maximum of the two to `resb`.
