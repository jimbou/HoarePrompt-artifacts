Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given problem description. It correctly handles the cases where the players stay at the same position or move to a different position, and it correctly calculates the scores for both players.

The program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the paths for both players, and it correctly handles the case where a player reaches a position that has already been visited. The program also correctly calculates the scores for both players by considering the maximum score that can be achieved by staying at the same position or moving to a different position.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the game lasts for only one turn, or when the players start at the same position. It also correctly handles the case where the game lasts for a large number of turns, by using a efficient algorithm to calculate the scores.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given problem description, and it handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
