Output State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb)), paths is a list of paths that must have at least len(pathb) paths.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `preb` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values, and `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and the length of `pathb`. Additionally, `paths` is a list of paths that must have at least as many paths as the length of `pathb`.
