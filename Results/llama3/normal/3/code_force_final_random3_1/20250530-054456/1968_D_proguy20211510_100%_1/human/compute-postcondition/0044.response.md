Postcondition: ***`curr`, `preb`, `resb`, `i` are updated as follows: if `k` is less than `i + 1`, then `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no updates are made.***
