The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and paths, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `paths`. If `i` is less than `len(paths)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated to `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(paths)`, so `i` must be updated to `i + 1` again and `paths` must have at least `i + 1` elements.
State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis`, `pathb`, `resb`, `ps`, and `preb` are unchanged, `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`, `ress` is updated to `max(ress, curr)`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `paths` must have at least `i + 1` elements**
