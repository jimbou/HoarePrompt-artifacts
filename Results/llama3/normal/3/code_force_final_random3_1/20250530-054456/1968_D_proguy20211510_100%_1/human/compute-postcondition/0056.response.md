To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `paths`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `paths`. If `i` is less than the length of `paths`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `paths` must have at least 2 paths.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `paths` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `preb` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values, `i` is 2, `paths` is a list of paths that must have at least 3 paths**
