Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb)).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is 0, paths is a list of paths that must have at least 1 path.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `preb` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values, `i` is 1, `paths` is a list of paths that must have at least 2 paths. If `k` is less than `i` + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is 2, paths is a list of paths that must have at least 3 paths.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
