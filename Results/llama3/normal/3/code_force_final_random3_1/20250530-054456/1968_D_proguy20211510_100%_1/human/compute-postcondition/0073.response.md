The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input value, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the input value is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, the input value must be at least 2.
State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb)), paths is a list of paths that must have at least len(pathb) + 1 paths. If resb is greater than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If ress is greater than resb, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.**
