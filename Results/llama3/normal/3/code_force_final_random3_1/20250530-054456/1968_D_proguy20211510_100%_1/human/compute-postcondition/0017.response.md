Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing multiple integer values a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], ..., a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (ps - 1)th index which is 1.**

The code snippet initializes the `vis` list with zeros and sets the `(ps - 1)`th index to 1. This overwrites the previous value of `vis`, which had zeros except for the `(p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1)`th index being 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
