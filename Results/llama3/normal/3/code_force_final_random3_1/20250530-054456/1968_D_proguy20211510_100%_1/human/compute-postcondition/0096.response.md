Output State: **If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, then `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, then `paths` is updated by appending the value of `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `vis[ps - 1]` determines whether the program breaks out of the loop or continues execution. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, all variables remain unchanged. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, `paths` is updated by appending the value of `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`.
