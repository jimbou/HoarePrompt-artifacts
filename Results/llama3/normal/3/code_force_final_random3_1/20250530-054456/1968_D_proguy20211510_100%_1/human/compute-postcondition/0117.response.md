Output State: **resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of preb plus the value of pathb[i] times the value of k minus i, preb is the value of its original value plus the value of pathb[i], ress is 0, pres is 0, curr, n, k, pb, p, a, vis remain unchanged, ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1, paths is updated by appending the values of a[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1, pathb must have at least 3 elements, i is 2. If k is less than i + 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

The final state of the program is as follows: The value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`. The value of `curr` is calculated as the sum of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i`. The value of `preb` is incremented by the value of `pathb[i]`. The values of `ress`, `pres`, `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, and `vis` remain unchanged. The value of `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, and the value of `paths` is updated by appending the values of `a[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. The value of `pathb` must have at least 3 elements, and the value of `i` is 2. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
