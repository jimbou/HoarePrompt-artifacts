The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `pathb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `pathb`. If `i` is less than `len(pathb)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either increased by 1 or remains the same depending on the value of `k`, `len(pathb)` is greater than the new value of `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `len(pathb)` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`curr` is updated to preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `preb` is updated to preb + pathb[i], `resb` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is increased by 1, `len(pathb)` is greater than the new value of `i`**
