The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `len(pathb)`. If `i` is less than `len(pathb)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value, `len(pathb)` is greater than the last value. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `len(pathb)` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`curr` is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `preb` is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], `resb` is the maximum value between its original value and curr, `i` is increased by 1, `len(pathb)` is greater than the new value of `i`**
