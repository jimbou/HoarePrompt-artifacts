Output State: **n, k, pb, p, a, vis, pathb, resb, ps, and preb are unchanged. curr is updated to pres + paths[i] * (k - i), pres is updated to pres + paths[i], and ress is updated to max(ress, curr). i is updated to i + 1.**

The code block updates the values of `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` based on the values of `pres`, `paths[i]`, `k`, and `i`. The value of `curr` is calculated as the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`. The value of `pres` is incremented by `paths[i]`, and the value of `ress` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the new value of `curr`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
