Output State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis` remain unchanged, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `paths` is updated by appending the values of `a[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `pathb` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres` remain 0. The values of `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis` are unchanged. The value of `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. The list `paths` is updated by appending the values of `a[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. The list `pathb` still has at least 1 element. The value of `i` is still 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
