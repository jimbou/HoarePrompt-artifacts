Output State: **vis[ps - 1] is 1, then resb, curr, preb, i, n, k, pb, ps, p, a, pathb, and paths remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If vis[ps - 1] is not 1, then paths is updated by appending the value of a[ps - 1], and ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: If the value at index ps-1 in the vis array is 1, then all variables remain unchanged and we exit the innermost loop or if statement. If the value at index ps-1 in the vis array is not 1, then the paths array is updated by adding the value at index ps-1 in the a array, and the value of ps is updated to the value at index ps-1 in the p array, but we still exit the innermost loop or if statement.
