Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1] that must have at least 2 elements, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of preb plus the value of pathb[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is 1, ps is p[ps - 1], paths is a list containing a[ps - 1] repeated ps - 1 times, preb is the value of its original value plus the value of pathb[i].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `curr`, `preb`, and `resb`. The first line calculates the value of `curr` by adding the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i` to `preb`. The second line increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. The third line updates `resb` to be the maximum of its original value and the newly calculated `curr`. The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `vis`, `pathb`, `pres`, `ress`, `i`, `ps`, and `paths` remain unchanged.
