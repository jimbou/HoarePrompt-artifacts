Postcondition: ***`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `preb` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values, `i` is 0, `paths` is a list of paths that must have at least 1 path. If `k` is less than `i` + 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `resb`, `curr`, and `preb`.***
