Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1], resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of preb plus the value of pathb[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(pathb), ps is p[ps - 1], paths is a list containing a[ps - 1] repeated ps - 1 times, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, preb is the sum of all elements in pathb.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates over the elements of pathb, updating the values of preb and resb. The value of preb is the sum of all elements in pathb, and the value of resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, which is the value of preb plus the value of pathb[i] times the value of k minus i. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
