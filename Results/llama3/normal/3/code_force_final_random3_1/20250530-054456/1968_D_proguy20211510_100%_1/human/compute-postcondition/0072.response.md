Postcondition: ***resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb)), paths is a list of paths that must have at least len(pathb) paths. If resb is greater than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If ress is greater than resb, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.***
