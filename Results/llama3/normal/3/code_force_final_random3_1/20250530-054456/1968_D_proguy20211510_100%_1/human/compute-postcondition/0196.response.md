Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis`, `pathb`, `resb`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `i`, `ps`, `paths`, and `preb` are as described in the precondition. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `resb`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `i`, `ps`, `paths`, and `preb` are updated as described in the precondition.**
