Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the current state of the program. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (pb-1)th index which is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 lines of input**
