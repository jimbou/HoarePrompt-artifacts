Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a single integer value a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (pb-1)th index which is 1 and currently equals 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 lines of input.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 lines of input.
