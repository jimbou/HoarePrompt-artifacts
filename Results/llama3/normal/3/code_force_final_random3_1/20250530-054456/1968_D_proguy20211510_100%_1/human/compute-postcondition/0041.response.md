Output State: **curr is updated to preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is updated to preb + pathb[i], resb is updated to the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is either increased by 1 or remains the same depending on the value of k, len(pathb) is greater than the new value of i.**

In this output state, the values of `curr`, `preb`, and `resb` are updated based on their original values and the values of `pathb[i]` and `k`. The value of `i` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, depending on whether `k` is less than `i + 1`. The length of `pathb` is greater than the new value of `i`.
