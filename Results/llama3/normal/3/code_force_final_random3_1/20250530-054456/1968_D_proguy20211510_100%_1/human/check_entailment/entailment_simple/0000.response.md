Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the maximum values of `resb` and `ress` calculated for each test case.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`.
2.  It correctly constructs the paths for Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation `p` and marking visited nodes to avoid infinite loops.
3.  The program correctly calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating over their respective paths and considering the remaining turns `k`.
4.  It correctly compares the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner or a draw based on the comparison.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the game, and its output will be correct for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
