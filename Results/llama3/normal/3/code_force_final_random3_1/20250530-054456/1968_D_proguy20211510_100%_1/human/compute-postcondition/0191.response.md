Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, p is an integer, a is an integer or a list of integers, vis is an integer or a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, resb is the maximum of its original value and (preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)), curr is preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), pres is an integer, ress is an integer, i is an integer, ps is an integer, paths is an integer or a list of integers, and preb is preb + pathb[i].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `curr`, `preb`, and `resb`. The first line calculates the value of `curr` by adding the product of `pathb[i]` and `(k - i)` to `preb`. The second line increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. The third line updates `resb` to be the maximum of its original value and the newly calculated `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
