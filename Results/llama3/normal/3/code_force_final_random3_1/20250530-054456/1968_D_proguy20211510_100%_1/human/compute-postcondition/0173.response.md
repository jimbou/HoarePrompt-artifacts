Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1], resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths), ps is p[p[ps - 1] - 1], paths is a list containing a[p[ps - 1] - 1], a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1].**

The code appends a new element to the `paths` list and updates the value of `ps`. The first line adds a new element to the `paths` list, which is the value of `a[ps - 1]`. This increases the length of the `paths` list by 1. The second line updates the value of `ps` to be the value of `p[ps - 1]`. This changes the value of `ps` to be the value of the element at index `ps - 1` in the `p` list. The value of `i` is updated to be the new length of the `paths` list. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis`, `pathb`, `resb`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged.
