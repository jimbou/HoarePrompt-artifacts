Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until it has processed all test cases from the input. The output will be a series of 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' strings, each indicating the winner of a game or a draw, based on the maximum values of resb and ress calculated for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a series of strings indicating the winner of each game or a draw, based on the calculations performed within the loop. The loop will continue to execute until it has processed all test cases from the input, and the output will reflect the results of these calculations.
