Since the `while` loop statement is `while True`, it will always execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a single integer value a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (pb-1)th index which is 1. If the (pb-1)th index of vis is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 lines of input.**
