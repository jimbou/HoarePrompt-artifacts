Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing multiple integer values a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], ..., a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is a list containing the integer values a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (ps - 1)th index which is 1. If vis[ps - 1] is 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made, ps is p[ps - 1].**

In this output state, the values of YES, NO, MOD, alpha, n, k, pb, p, a, pathb, and vis remain unchanged. The list paths now contains an additional integer value a[ps - 1], and the value of ps has been updated to p[ps - 1].
