Output State: **curr is updated to preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is updated to preb + pathb[i], resb is updated to the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `curr`, `preb`, and `resb` are updated based on the given code. The value of `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, which means it now holds the result of the calculation involving `preb`, `pathb[i]`, and `k - i`. The value of `preb` is incremented by `pathb[i]`, and the value of `resb` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
