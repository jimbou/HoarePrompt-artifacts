To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `paths`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `paths`. If `i` is less than the length of `paths`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `paths` has at least 1 path. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `paths` must have at least 2 paths.

State: **`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `preb` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values, `i` is 1, `paths` is a list of paths that must have at least 2 paths**
