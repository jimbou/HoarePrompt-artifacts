Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0), preb is the sum of its original value and a[pb - 1], i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb), n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], and a[p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program's state is updated based on the value of `vis[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, then `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, then `paths` is updated by appending the value of `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *If vis[ps - 1] is 1, then resb, curr, preb, i, n, k, pb, ps, p, a, pathb, and paths remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If vis[ps - 1] is not 1, then paths is updated by appending the value of a[ps - 1], and ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
