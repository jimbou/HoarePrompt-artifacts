Since the `while` loop statement is `while True`, it will always execute again, regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with vis[p[pb - 1] - 1] equal to 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, ps is an integer, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths)**
