The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `paths`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `paths`. If `paths` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `len(pathb)`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `paths` must have at least 1 element.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `curr` is the value of `preb` plus the value of `pathb[i]` times the value of `k` minus `i`, `pres` is the value of its original value plus the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `i` is 0, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]` repeated `ps - 1` times that must have at least 1 element, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`.**
