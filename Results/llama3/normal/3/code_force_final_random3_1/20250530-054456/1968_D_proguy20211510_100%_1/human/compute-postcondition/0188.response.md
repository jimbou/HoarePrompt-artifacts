The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `pathb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pathb`. If `pathb` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `pathb` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `pathb` must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]` that must have at least 3 elements, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `curr` is the value of `preb` plus the value of `pathb[i]` times the value of `k` minus `i`, `pres` is the value of its original value plus the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `i` is 2, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]` repeated `ps - 1` times, `preb` is the value of its original value plus the value of `pathb[i]`.**
