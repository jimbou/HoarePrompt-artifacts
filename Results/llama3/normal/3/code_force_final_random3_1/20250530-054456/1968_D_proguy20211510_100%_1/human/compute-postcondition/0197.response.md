Output State: **n is unchanged, k is unchanged, pb is unchanged, p is unchanged, a is unchanged, vis is unchanged, pathb is unchanged, resb is unchanged, curr is updated to pres + paths[i] * (k - i), pres is updated to pres + paths[i], ress is updated to max(ress, curr), i is unchanged, ps is unchanged, paths is unchanged, and preb is unchanged.**

The code updates the values of `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` based on the values of `pres`, `paths[i]`, `k`, and `i`. The first line calculates the new value of `curr` by adding the product of `paths[i]` and `(k - i)` to `pres`. The second line increments `pres` by `paths[i]`. The third line updates `ress` to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
