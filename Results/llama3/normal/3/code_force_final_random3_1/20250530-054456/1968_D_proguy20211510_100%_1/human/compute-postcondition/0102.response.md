Postcondition: ***If vis[ps - 1] is 1, then resb, curr, preb, i, n, k, pb, ps, p, a, pathb, and paths remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If vis[ps - 1] is not 1, then paths is updated by appending the value of a[ps - 1], and ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
