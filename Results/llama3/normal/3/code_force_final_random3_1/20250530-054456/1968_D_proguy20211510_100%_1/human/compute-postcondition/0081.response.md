Output State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0), preb is the sum of its original value and a[pb - 1], i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb), n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the p[pb - 1]-1th element set to 1.**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `pathb`. Since `pathb` originally contained `a[pb - 1]`, it now contains `a[pb - 1]` and `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`. The second line assigns the value of `p[pb - 1]` to `pb`. This changes the value of `pb` to the value of the `pb-1`th element of the list `p`. 

The values of `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `paths`, and `vis` are not affected by the code. The value of `vis` remains a list of `n` zeros, but the index of the element set to 1 changes to `p[pb - 1]-1` due to the update of `pb`.
