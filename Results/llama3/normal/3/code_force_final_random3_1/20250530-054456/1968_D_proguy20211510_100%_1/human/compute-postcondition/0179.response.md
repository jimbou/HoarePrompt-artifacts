The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and pathb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the pathb.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1], resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths), ps is p[ps - 1], paths is a list containing a[ps - 1] repeated ps - 1 times, resb is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is 0.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0 except vis[ps - 1] which is 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1] that must have at least 1 element, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is 0, ps is p[ps - 1], paths is a list containing a[ps - 1] repeated ps - 1 times, resb is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0**
