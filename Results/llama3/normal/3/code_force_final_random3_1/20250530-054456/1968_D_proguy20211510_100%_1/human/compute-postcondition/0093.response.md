Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0), `preb` is the sum of its original value and `a[pb - 1]`, `i` is equal to the minimum value between `k` and `len(pathb)`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1]`, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the `ps-1`th element set to 1, and the current value of `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted by the break statement.
