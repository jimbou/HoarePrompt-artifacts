Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `curr` is the value of `preb` plus the value of `pathb[i]` times the value of `k` minus `i`, `preb` is the value of its original value plus the value of `pathb[i]`, `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis` remain unchanged, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `paths` is updated by appending the values of `a[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `pathb` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis` remain the same as before. The value of `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. The value of `paths` is updated by appending the values of `a[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. The value of `i` is still 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
