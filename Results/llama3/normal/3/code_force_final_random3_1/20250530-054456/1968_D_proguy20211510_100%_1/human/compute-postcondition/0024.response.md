Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing multiple integer values a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], ..., a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], paths is a list containing the integer values a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (ps - 1)th index which is 1.**

The code modifies the `paths` list by appending the value of `a[ps - 1]`, and updates the value of `ps` to `p[ps - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
