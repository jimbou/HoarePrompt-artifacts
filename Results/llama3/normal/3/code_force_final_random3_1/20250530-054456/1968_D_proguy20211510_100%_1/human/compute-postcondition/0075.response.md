Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb), n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1**
