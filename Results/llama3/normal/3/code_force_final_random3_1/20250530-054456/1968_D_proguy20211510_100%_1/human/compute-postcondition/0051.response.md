Output State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is 0, paths is a list of paths that must have at least 1 path.**

In this output state, the value of resb is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr. The value of curr is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i). The value of preb is updated to be the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values. The value of i remains 0, and the list of paths remains unchanged, with at least 1 path.
