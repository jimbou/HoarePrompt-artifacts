Output State: **If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, then `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, then `paths` is updated by appending the value of `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, with the only difference being that if `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, then `paths` is updated by appending the value of `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
