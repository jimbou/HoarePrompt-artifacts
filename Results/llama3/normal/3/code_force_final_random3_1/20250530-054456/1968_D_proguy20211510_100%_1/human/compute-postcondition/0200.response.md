Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis`, `pathb`, `resb`, `ps`, `paths`, and `preb` are unchanged. If `k` is less than `i` + 1, then `curr` is updated to `pres` + `paths[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `pres` is updated to `pres` + `paths[i]`, `ress` is updated to `max(ress, curr)`, and `i` is updated to `i` + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
