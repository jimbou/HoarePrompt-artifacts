Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the current state of the program. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with vis[pb - 1] equal to 1, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, ps is an integer, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths)**
