Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with vis[pb - 1] equal to 1, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, ps is an integer, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths)
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[pb - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with vis[pb - 1] equal to 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, ps is an integer, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths). If vis[pb - 1] is equal to 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing changes.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, vis is a list of integers with vis[p[pb - 1] - 1] equal to 1, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, ps is an integer, resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, i is len(paths). If vis[pb - 1] is equal to 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `vis` is a list of integers with `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` equal to 1, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `ps` is an integer, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `curr` is the value of `pres` plus the value of `paths[i]` times the value of `k` minus `i`, `pres` is the value of its original value plus the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`. If `vis[pb - 1]` equals 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
