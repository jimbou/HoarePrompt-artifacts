Since the `while` loop statement is `while True`, it will always execute again, regardless of the current state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **`vis[ps - 1]` is 1, then `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `vis[ps - 1]` is not 1, then `paths` is updated by appending the value of `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`.**
