The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range of the loop is defined by the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of the loop. If the range of the loop is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the range of the loop is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the range of the loop must be at least 2.
State: **resb is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, curr is the value of pres plus the value of paths[i] times the value of k minus i, pres is the value of its original value plus the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the value of curr, n, k, pb, p, a, vis remain unchanged, ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1, paths is a list that must have at least len(paths) + 1 elements, pathb must have at least len(pathb) + len(paths) elements, i is len(paths)**
