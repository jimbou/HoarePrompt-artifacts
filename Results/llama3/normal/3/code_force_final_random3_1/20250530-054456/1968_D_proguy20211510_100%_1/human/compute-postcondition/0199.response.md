Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `pb` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `vis` is unchanged, `pathb` is unchanged, `resb` is unchanged, `curr` is updated to `pres` + `paths[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `pres` is updated to `pres` + `paths[i]`, `ress` is updated to `max(ress, curr)`, `i` is updated to `i` + 1, `ps` is unchanged, `paths` is unchanged, and `preb` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain unchanged except for `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, and `i`, which are updated according to their respective formulas. Additionally, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
