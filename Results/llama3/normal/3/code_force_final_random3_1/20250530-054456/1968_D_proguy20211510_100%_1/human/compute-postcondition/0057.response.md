Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of `curr`, `curr` is the maximum value between its original value and `preb` + `pathb[i]` * (`k` - `i`), `preb` is the sum of its original value and the sum of all `pathb[i]` values, `i` is 2, `paths` is a list of paths that must have at least 3 paths, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, and `paths` remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the control flow of the program by exiting the current loop or if statement.
