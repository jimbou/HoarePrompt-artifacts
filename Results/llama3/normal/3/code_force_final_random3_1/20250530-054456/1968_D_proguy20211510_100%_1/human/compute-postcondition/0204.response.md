Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis`, `pathb`, `resb`, `ps`, and `preb` are unchanged, `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`, `ress` is updated to `max(ress, curr)`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, `paths` must have at least `i + 1` elements.***
