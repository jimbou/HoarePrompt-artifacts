Output State: **The loop will break when `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, and the values of `resb`, `curr`, `preb`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb` remain unchanged. The value of `paths` will be updated by appending the values of `a[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, and the value of `ps` will be updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will terminate when it encounters a node that has already been visited (i.e., `vis[ps - 1]` is 1). Until then, the loop will continue to update the `paths` list by appending the values of `a[ps - 1]` and update the value of `ps` to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
