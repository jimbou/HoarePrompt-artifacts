Output State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0), preb is the sum of its original value and a[pb - 1], i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb), n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1**

In this output state, the value of `resb` remains the same as its original value because it is not modified by the code. The value of `curr` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, where `pathb[0]` is `a[pb - 1]`. The value of `preb` is incremented by `a[pb - 1]`. The value of `i` is still the minimum value between `k` and the length of `pathb`, which is now 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, and `paths` remain unchanged. The value of `pb` is updated to be `p[pb - 1]`. The list `pathb` now contains `a[pb - 1]`. The list `vis` remains the same with the `pb-1`th element set to 1.
