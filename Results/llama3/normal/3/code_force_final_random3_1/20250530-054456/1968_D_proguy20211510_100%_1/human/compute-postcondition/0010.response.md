Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing two integer values a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (p[pb - 1] - 1)th index which is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of any variables.
