Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1,000,000,007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer equal to p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing multiple integer values a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], ..., a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1], paths is a list containing the integer value a[ps - 1], vis is a list of n integers initialized with zeros except for the (ps - 1)th index which is 1. If the (ps - 1)th index of vis is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
