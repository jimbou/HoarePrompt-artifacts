Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `curr` is the value of `pres` plus the value of `paths[i]` times the value of `k` minus `i`, `pres` is the value of its original value plus the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis` remain unchanged, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `pathb` must have at least `len(pathb) + 1` elements, `i` is 2.**

The code block modifies the values of `curr`, `pres`, and `ress`. The first line calculates the value of `curr` by adding the value of `pres` to the product of `paths[i]` and `k - i`. The second line increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`. The third line updates `ress` to be the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`. The values of `resb`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis`, `ps`, `paths`, and `pathb` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2.
