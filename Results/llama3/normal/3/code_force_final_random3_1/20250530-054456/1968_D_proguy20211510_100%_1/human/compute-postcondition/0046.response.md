Output State: **resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr, curr is the maximum value between its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values, i is equal to the minimum value between k and len(pathb)).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of resb is the maximum value between its original value and the maximum value of curr.
- The value of curr is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and (k - i).
- The value of preb is the sum of its original value and the sum of all pathb[i] values.
- The value of i is equal to the minimum value between k and the length of pathb.
