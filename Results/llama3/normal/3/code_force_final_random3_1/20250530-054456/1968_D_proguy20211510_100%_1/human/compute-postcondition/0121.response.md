Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `curr`, `curr` is the value of `preb` plus the value of `pathb[i]` times the value of `k` minus `i`, `preb` is the value of its original value plus the value of `pathb[i]`, `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `vis` remain unchanged, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pathb` must have at least `len(pathb)` elements, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted by the break statement.
