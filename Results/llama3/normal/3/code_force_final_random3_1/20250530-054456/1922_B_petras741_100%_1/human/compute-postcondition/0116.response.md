Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, j is 1, eta is the list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q[eta[1]], res is the value of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code adds the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to `res` and the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to `res`. It also adds the value of `q[eta[j]]` to `rho`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `buffer`, `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
