Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `eta_ln` is the number of elements in `eta`, `rho` is 1, `res` is 1 because q[eta[0]] is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to 0, `w` is still a list of integers, `buffer` is still an empty list, `q` is still a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is still a list containing all the values of `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `j` is still `n`, `eta_ln` is still the number of elements in `eta`, `rho` is still 1, `res` is now 1 because `q[eta[0]]` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and `eta_ln` is still not equal to 1.
