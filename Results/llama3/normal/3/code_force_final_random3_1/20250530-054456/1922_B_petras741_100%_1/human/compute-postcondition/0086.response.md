Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where the value at index w[j] is n and all other values are 0 except the value at index w[0], w[1], w[2], ..., w[n-1] which is n-1. Then, a list eta is created containing the values of j which is 0, 1, 2, ..., n if q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise eta is a list containing 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1. The length of eta is calculated and stored in eta_ln. If eta_ln is 1, the value of q at index eta[0] is stored in rho, otherwise the sum of all values in q is stored in rho. Then, either the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 is printed if eta_ln is 1, or the sum of the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 divided by 2 times the sum of all values in q at indices less than eta[j] is printed if eta_ln is greater than 1. If n is less than 3, 0 is printed.***
