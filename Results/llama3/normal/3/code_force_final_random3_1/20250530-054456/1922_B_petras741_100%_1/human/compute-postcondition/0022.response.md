Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing the value `j` because the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `w` is still a list of integers, `buffer` is still an empty list, `q` is still a list of `n+1` integers with the same values, `j` is still 2, and `eta` now contains the value `j` because `q[j]` is greater than 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
