Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer greater than -1, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is n and all other values are 0 except the value at index w[0], w[1], w[2], ..., w[n-1] which is n-1, eta is a list containing the values of j which is 0, 1, 2, ..., n if q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise eta is a list containing 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, j is 1, eta_ln is the length of eta and is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q at index eta[1], res is the value of q at index eta[0] times the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[1] times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[1] times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[0], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

The code modifies the values of `res` and `rho`. The first line increments `res` by the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 1 times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 2 divided by 6. The second line increments `res` by the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of `rho`. The third line increments `rho` by the value of `q` at index `eta[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
