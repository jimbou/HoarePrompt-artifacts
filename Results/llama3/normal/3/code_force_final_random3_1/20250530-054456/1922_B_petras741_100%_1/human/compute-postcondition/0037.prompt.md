Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `eta_ln` is the number of elements in `eta`, `rho` is 1, `res` is 1 because q[eta[0]] is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is 1, eta_ln is greater than 1, rho is 1 plus q[eta[1]], res is 1 plus q[eta[1]] times (q[eta[1]] - 1) times (q[eta[1]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[1]] times (q[eta[1]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[1]], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is 3, eta_ln is greater than 2, rho is 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]], res is 1 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) times (q[eta[2]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] times (q[eta[3]] - 1) times (q[eta[3]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[3]] times (q[eta[3]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is 5, eta_ln is greater than 2, rho is 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] plus q[eta[4]] plus q[eta[5]], res is 1 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) times (q[eta[2]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] times (q[eta[3]] - 1) times (q[eta[3]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[3]] times (q[eta[3]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] plus q[eta[4]] times (q[eta[4]] - 1) times (q[eta[4]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[4]] times (q[eta[4]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] plus q[eta[4]] plus q[eta[5]] times (q[eta[5]] - 1) times (q[eta[5]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[5]] times (q[eta[5]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] plus q[eta[4]] plus q[eta[5]], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
