Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `w[j]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are zeros, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing the value 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value 1, which is the current value of `j`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
