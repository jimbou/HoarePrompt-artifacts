#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n).
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        
        if n >= 3:
            q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n):
                q[w[j]] += 1
            eta = []
            for j in range(n + 1):

                    eta.append(j)
            eta_ln = len(eta)
            rho = q[eta[0]]
            if eta_ln == 1:
                print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
            else:
                res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
                for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                    rho += q[eta[j]]

    #State: t is 0, i is t, n is an integer equal to the last input value, w is a list of integers equal to the last input values, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains no test cases. If the last n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, and a list eta containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0 is created. If the length of eta is equal to 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed. If the length of eta is at least 2, the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln) is printed, where rho is the sum of q at all indices in eta. If the last n is less than 3, 0 is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates and prints the number of combinations of 3 elements that can be formed from the given integers, taking into account the occurrences of each integer. If the number of integers is less than 3, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
