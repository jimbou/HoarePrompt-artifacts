Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `w[j]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are zeros, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing the values from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0. stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `j` has reached the value `n`, and the list `eta` contains all the indices from 0 to `n` where the value of `q[j]` is greater than 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
