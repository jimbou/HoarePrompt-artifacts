The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, where `n` is an integer greater than 0.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression, which represents the number of combinations of 3 elements that can be chosen from a set of `n` elements.

Output: **n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
