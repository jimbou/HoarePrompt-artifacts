Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the second input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, and `buffer` remain unchanged. The new variable `q` is introduced, which is a list of `n + 1` zeros. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
