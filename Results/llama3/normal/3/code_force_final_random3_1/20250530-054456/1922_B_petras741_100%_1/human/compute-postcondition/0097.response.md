Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `w[j]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are zeros, `eta` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, a new variable `eta` is introduced and assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The value of `j` is still `n - 1`.
