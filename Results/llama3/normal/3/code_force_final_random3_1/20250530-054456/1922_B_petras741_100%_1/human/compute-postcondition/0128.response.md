Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input value, w is a list of integers equal to the second input values, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is less than 3, 0 is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n + 1 integers is created where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, and a list eta containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0 is created. If the length of eta is equal to 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed. If the length of eta is at least 2, the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln) is printed, where rho is the sum of q at all indices in eta.***
