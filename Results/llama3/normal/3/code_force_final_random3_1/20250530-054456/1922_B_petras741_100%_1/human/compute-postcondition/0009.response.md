To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and `q[w[1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 2**
