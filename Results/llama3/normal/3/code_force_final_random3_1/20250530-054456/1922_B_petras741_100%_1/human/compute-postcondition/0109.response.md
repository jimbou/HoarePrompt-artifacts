Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, j is n, eta is a list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta, rho is the value of q at index eta[0], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `buffer`, `q`, `j`, and `eta` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces two new variables: `eta_ln` and `rho`. `eta_ln` is assigned the length of the list `eta`, and `rho` is assigned the value of `q` at index `eta[0]`. The stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus two.
