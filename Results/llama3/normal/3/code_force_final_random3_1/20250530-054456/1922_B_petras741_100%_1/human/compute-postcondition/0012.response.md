Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is `n-1`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is still a list of integers, `buffer` is still an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is 1 for all `j` from 0 to `n-1` and the rest are 0, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, and `j` is now `n-1`.
