The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 1**
