Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, `j` is n, `eta` is a list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of eta, `rho` is the value of q at index eta[0], `res` is the value of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and eta_ln is greater than 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is calculated as the product of the value at index `eta[0]` in list `q`, the value at index `eta[0]` in list `q` minus 1, and the value at index `eta[0]` in list `q` minus 2, all divided by 6. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by two.
