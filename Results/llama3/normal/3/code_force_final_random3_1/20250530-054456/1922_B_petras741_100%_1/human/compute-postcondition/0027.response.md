The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a mathematical formula to calculate the number of combinations of 3 items from a set of `n` items.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the expression will evaluate to a non-negative integer.

Output: **n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 (where n is the number of items)**
