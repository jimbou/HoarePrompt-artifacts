To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `eta_ln`. The loop will execute if `eta_ln` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `eta_ln`. Therefore, we need to adjust `eta_ln` to be at least 2. Since `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, we can set it to be greater than 1. We also need to adjust `j` to be 1, because it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is 1, `res` is 1 because q[eta[0]] is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
