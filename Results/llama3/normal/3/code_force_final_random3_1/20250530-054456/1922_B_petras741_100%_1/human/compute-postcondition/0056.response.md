The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `n-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0 and `n` must be greater than -1. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than -1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `n` and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]`, `w[1]`, `w[2]`, ..., `w[n-1]` which is `n-1`, `eta` is an empty list, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
