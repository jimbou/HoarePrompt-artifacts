Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[1]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1, where `j` is 1. Since `w` is a list of integers, `w[1]` is an integer. The value at index `w[1]` in list `q` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
