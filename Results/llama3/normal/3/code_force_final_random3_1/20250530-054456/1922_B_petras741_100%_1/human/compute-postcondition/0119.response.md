The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and eta_ln, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and eta_ln. If j is less than eta_ln, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, eta_ln is at least 2. For the loop to execute again j is increased by 1 so j is 3 and for the loop to execute again eta_ln must be greater than 3.
State: **t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, j is 3, eta is the list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q[eta[1]] plus q[eta[2]], res is the value of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
