Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[1]` is 1 and the value at index `w[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `q` at index `w[2]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
