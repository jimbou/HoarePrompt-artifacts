Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and `q[w[1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[1]]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
