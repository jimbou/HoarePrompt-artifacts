Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, buffer is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is n, eta_ln is the number of elements in eta, rho is 1. If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is being printed, which is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6. Otherwise, res is 1 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] times (q[eta[j]] - 1) times (q[eta[j]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[j]] times (q[eta[j]] - 1) divided by 2 times the sum of q[eta[k]] for all k in range(1, j) for all j in range(1, eta_ln), and res is printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where the value at index w[j] is n and all other values are 0 except the value at index w[0], w[1], w[2], ..., w[n-1] which is n-1. Then, a list eta is created containing the values of j which is 0, 1, 2, ..., n if q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise eta is a list containing 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1. The length of eta is calculated and stored in eta_ln. If eta_ln is 1, the value of q at index eta[0] is stored in rho, otherwise the sum of all values in q is stored in rho. Then, either the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 is printed if eta_ln is 1, or the sum of the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 divided by 2 times the sum of all values in q at indices less than eta[j] is printed if eta_ln is greater than 1. If n is less than 3, 0 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input value, w is a list of integers equal to the second input values, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is less than 3, 0 is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n + 1 integers is created where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, and a list eta containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0 is created. If the length of eta is equal to 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed. If the length of eta is at least 2, the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln) is printed, where rho is the sum of q at all indices in eta.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
