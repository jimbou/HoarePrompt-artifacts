Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `n` and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]`, `w[1]`, `w[2]`, ..., `w[n-1]` which is `n-1`, `eta` is a list containing the values of `j` which is 1 and 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value of `j`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
