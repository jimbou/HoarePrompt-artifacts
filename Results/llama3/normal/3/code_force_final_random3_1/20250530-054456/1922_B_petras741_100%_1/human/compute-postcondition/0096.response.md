Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `w[j]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it increments the value at index `w[j]` in list `q` by 1. As a result, the final state of `q` will have the count of occurrences of each value in `w` at their respective indices, with the rest being zeros. The loop counter `j` will be `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
