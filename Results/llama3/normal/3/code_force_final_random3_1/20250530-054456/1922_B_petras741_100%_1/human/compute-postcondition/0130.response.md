Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates and prints the number of combinations of 3 elements that can be formed from the given integers, taking into account the occurrences of each integer. If the number of integers is less than 3, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.**
