Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer greater than -1, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is n and all other values are 0 except the value at index w[0], w[1], w[2], ..., w[n-1] which is n-1, eta is a list containing the values of j which is 0, 1, 2, ..., n if q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise eta is a list containing 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, j is equal to the length of eta, eta_ln is the length of eta, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] if eta_ln is 1, otherwise rho is the sum of all values in q, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and either the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 is being printed if eta_ln is 1, or the sum of the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 divided by 2 times the sum of all values in q at indices less than eta[j] is being printed if eta_ln is greater than 1.***
