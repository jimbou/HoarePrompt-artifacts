Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the variable `q` has been assigned a list of `n+1` zeros, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still greater than 0, `i` still 0, `w` still a list of integers, and `buffer` still an empty list. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
