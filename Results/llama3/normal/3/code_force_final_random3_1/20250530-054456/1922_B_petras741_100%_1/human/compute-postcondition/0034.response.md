Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is 3, eta_ln is greater than 2, rho is 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]], res is 1 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) times (q[eta[2]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] times (q[eta[3]] - 1) times (q[eta[3]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[3]] times (q[eta[3]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

The code increments the value of `res` by adding two terms. The first term is the product of `q[eta[j]]`, `q[eta[j]] - 1`, and `q[eta[j]] - 2`, divided by 6. The second term is the product of `q[eta[j]]`, `q[eta[j]] - 1`, divided by 2, and `rho`. The value of `rho` is also incremented by `q[eta[j]]`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected.
