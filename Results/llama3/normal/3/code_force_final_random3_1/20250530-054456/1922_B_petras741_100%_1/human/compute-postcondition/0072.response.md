Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than -1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is n and all other values are 0 except the value at index w[0], w[1], w[2], ..., w[n-1] which is n-1, `eta` is a list containing the values of j which is 0, 1, 2, ..., n if q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise eta is a list containing 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, `j` is n, `eta_ln` is the length of eta and is greater than 1, `rho` is the value of q at index eta[0], `res` is the value of q at index eta[0] times the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2 divided by 6, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: all variables keep their initial values except for `res`, which is now assigned the value of the combination of the value of q at index eta[0] taken 3 at a time, calculated as q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6.
