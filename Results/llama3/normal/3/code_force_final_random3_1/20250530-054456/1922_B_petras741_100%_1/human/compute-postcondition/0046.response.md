Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value from the input, and the list `w` now contains the integers from the input. The variable `t` remains greater than 0, and `i` remains 1. The `buffer` list is still empty. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by two, as two inputs have been read.
