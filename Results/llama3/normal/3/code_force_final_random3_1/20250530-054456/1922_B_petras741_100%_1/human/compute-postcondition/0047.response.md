Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the variable q has been added, which is a list of n+1 zeros. The other variables remain unchanged, with t still greater than 0, i still 1, n still equal to the input value, w still a list of integers equal to the input values, and buffer still an empty list. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
