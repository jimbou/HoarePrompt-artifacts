Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer greater than -1, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is n and all other values are 0 except the value at index w[0], w[1], w[2], ..., w[n-1] which is n-1, eta is a list containing the values of j which is 0, 1, 2, ..., n if q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise eta is a list containing 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, j is 2, eta_ln is the length of eta and is at least 3, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q at index eta[1] plus q at index eta[2] plus q at index eta[j], res is the value of q at index eta[0] times the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[1] times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[1] times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[2] times the value of q at index eta[2] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[2] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[2] times the value of q at index eta[2] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[1] plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[1], stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

The code modifies the values of `res` and `rho` by adding the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 1 times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 2 divided by 6 to `res`, and the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` to `rho`. The value of `j` is 2, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is at least 3. The value of `q` at index `eta[j]` is added to `rho`, and the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 1 times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 2 divided by 6 is added to `res`. The value of `res` is also modified by adding the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of `q` at index `eta[0]` and the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` times the value of `q` at index `eta[j]` minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of `q` at index `eta[1]`.
