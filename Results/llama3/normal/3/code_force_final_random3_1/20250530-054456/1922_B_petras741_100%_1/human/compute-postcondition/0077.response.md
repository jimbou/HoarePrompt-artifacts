To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects accordingly.


The loop head is `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`. The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `eta_ln`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `eta_ln`. If `j` is less than `eta_ln`, the loop can execute again.


At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `eta_ln` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3.


State: **t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer greater than -1, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is n and all other values are 0 except the value at index w[0], w[1], w[2], ..., w[n-1] which is n-1, eta is a list containing the values of j which is 0, 1, 2, ..., n if q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise eta is a list containing 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, j is 3, eta_ln is the length of eta and is at least 3, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q at index eta[1] plus q at index eta[2] plus q at index eta[j], res is the value of q at index eta[0] times the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[1] times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[1] times the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[2] times the value of q at index eta[2] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[2] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[2] times the value of q at index eta[2] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[1] plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2 divided by 6 plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[j] times the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1 divided by 2 times the value of q at index eta[1], stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**
