Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value `j` because the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
