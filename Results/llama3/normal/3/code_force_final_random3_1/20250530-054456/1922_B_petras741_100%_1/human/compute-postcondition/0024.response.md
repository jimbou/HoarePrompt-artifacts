Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the values of `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `eta` will contain all the indices `j` from the list `q` where the value at that index is greater than 0. The loop will have iterated over all indices in the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), and `j` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes. The other variables remain unchanged.
