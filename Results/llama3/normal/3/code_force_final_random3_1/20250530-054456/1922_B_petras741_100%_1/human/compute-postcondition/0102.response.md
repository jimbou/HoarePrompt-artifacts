The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at each index `w[j]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` and the rest are zeros, `j` is 1. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list. stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
