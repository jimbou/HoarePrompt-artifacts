The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and eta_ln, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and eta_ln. If j is less than eta_ln, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1, eta_ln is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 and eta_ln must be greater than 2.
State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is 2, eta_ln is greater than 2, rho is 1 plus q[eta[2]], res is 1 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) times (q[eta[2]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
