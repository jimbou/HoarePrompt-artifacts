Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than -1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `n` and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]`, `w[1]`, `w[2]`, ..., `w[n-1]` which is `n-1`, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` which is 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is an empty list, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.***
