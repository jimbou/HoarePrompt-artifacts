Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is 5, eta_ln is greater than 2, rho is 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] plus q[eta[4]] plus q[eta[5]], res is 1 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) times (q[eta[2]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[2]] times (q[eta[2]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] times (q[eta[3]] - 1) times (q[eta[3]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[3]] times (q[eta[3]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] plus q[eta[4]] times (q[eta[4]] - 1) times (q[eta[4]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[4]] times (q[eta[4]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] plus q[eta[4]] plus q[eta[5]] times (q[eta[5]] - 1) times (q[eta[5]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[5]] times (q[eta[5]] - 1) divided by 2 times 1 plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]] plus q[eta[4]] plus q[eta[5]], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code block increments the value of `res` by adding the product of `q[eta[j]]`, `(q[eta[j]] - 1)`, and `(q[eta[j]] - 2)` divided by 6, and the product of `q[eta[j]]`, `(q[eta[j]] - 1)`, and `rho` divided by 2. It also increments the value of `rho` by adding `q[eta[j]]`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected.
