Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 2, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is 2 and all other values are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 2 at index `w[j]` in the list `q`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
