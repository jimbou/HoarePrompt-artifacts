Output: **1 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] times (q[eta[j]] - 1) times (q[eta[j]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[j]] times (q[eta[j]] - 1) divided by 2 times the sum of q[eta[k]] for all k in range(1, j) for all j in range(1, eta_ln), where eta_ln is greater than or equal to 0, q[eta[j]] is 1 for all j in range(1, eta_ln), and q[eta[k]] is 1 for all k in range(1, j)**
