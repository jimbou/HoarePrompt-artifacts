Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `n` and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]`, `w[1]`, `w[2]`, ..., `w[n-1]` which is `n-1`, `eta` is a list containing the values of `j` which is 1 and 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing 1, `j` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer greater than 1, `w` is still a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is still an empty list, `q` is still a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `n` and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]`, `w[1]`, `w[2]`, ..., `w[n-1]` which is `n-1`, `eta` is a list containing the values of `j` which is 1 and 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing 1 and now also contains the value of `j` which is 2, `j` is now 3, and there are two less test cases in stdin.
