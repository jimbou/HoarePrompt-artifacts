Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `n` and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]`, `w[1]`, `w[2]`, ..., `w[n-1]` which is `n-1`, `eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, a new variable `eta` has been introduced and assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
