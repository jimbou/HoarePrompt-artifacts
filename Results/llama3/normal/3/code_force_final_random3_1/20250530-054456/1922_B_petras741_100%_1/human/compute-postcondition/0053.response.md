Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is 3 and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]` and `w[1]` which is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `w` is still a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is still an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is 3 and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]` and `w[1]` which is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is still 2.
