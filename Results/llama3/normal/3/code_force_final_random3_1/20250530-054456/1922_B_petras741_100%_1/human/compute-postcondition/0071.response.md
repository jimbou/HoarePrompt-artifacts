Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer greater than -1, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is n and all other values are 0 except the value at index w[0], w[1], w[2], ..., w[n-1] which is n-1, eta is a list containing the values of j which is 0, 1, 2, ..., n if q[j] is greater than 0, otherwise eta is a list containing 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1, j is n, eta_ln is the length of eta and is greater than 1, rho is the value of q at index eta[0], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.***
