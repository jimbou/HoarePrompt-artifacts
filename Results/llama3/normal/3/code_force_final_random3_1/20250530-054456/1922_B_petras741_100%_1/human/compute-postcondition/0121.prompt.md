Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, `j` is n, `eta` is a list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of eta, `rho` is the value of q at index eta[0], `res` is the value of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and eta_ln is greater than 1
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, j is 1, eta is the list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q[eta[1]], res is the value of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, j is 2, eta is the list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q[eta[1]] plus q[eta[2]], res is the value of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, j is 3, eta is the list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus q[eta[1]] plus q[eta[2]] plus q[eta[3]], res is the value of q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
