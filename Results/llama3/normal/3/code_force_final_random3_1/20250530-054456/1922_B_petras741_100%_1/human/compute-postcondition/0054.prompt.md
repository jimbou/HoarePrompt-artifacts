Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    q[w[j]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is 1 and all other values are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 2, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is 2 and all other values are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is 3 and all other values are 0 except the value at index `w[0]` and `w[1]` which is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
