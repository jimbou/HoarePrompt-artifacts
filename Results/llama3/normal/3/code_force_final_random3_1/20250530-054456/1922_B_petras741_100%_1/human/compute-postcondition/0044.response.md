Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is n, eta_ln is the number of elements in eta, rho is 1. If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is being printed, which is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6. Otherwise, res is 1 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] times (q[eta[j]] - 1) times (q[eta[j]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[j]] times (q[eta[j]] - 1) divided by 2 times the sum of q[eta[k]] for all k in range(1, j) for all j in range(1, eta_ln), and res is printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is being printed.***
