The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `j`, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`.**
