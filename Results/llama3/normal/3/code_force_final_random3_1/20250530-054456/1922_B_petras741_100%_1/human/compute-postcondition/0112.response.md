Output: **t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n + 1 integers where the value at each index w[j] is equal to the number of occurrences of w[j] in w and the rest are zeros, j is n, eta is a list containing the values from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta and is equal to 1, rho is the value of q at index eta[0], stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements, which is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6, is being printed**
