Output: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]] is 1, q[w[1]] is 1, q[w[2]] is 1, ..., q[w[n-1]] is 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the values of j where q[j] is greater than 0, j is eta_ln, eta_ln is greater than or equal to 0, rho is 1 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range(1, eta_ln), res is 1 plus the sum of q[eta[j]] times (q[eta[j]] - 1) times (q[eta[j]] - 2) divided by 6 plus q[eta[j]] times (q[eta[j]] - 1) divided by 2 times the sum of q[eta[k]] for all k in range(1, j) for all j in range(1, eta_ln), stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and res is printed**
