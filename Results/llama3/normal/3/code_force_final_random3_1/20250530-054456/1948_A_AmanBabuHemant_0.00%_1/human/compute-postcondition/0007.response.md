Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 integers (1 <= n <= 50), and `s` is a string of '110' repeated n/2 times**

In this output state, the value of `s` is calculated by repeating the string '110' n/2 times, where n is an even integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` still being 0, and stdin still containing t-1 integers.
