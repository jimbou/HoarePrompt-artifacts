Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 2, `s` is a string of '110' repeated n//2 times, stdin contains t-5 integers (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n//2` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The other variables, `t`, `_`, and the contents of stdin, remain unchanged.
