Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 integers (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` of '110' repeated n/2 times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, 'NO' is printed.***
