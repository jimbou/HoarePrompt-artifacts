Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 integers (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. The value of `t` remains the same, and the value of `_` is still 0. The stdin now contains t-1 integers, as one integer has been consumed by the input operation.
