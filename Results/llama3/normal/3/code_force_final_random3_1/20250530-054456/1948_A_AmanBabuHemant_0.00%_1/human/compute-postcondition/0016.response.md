Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 integers (1 <= n <= 50), and `s` is a string of '110' repeated n/2 times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed, which is '110' repeated n/2 times. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, 'NO' is printed.***
