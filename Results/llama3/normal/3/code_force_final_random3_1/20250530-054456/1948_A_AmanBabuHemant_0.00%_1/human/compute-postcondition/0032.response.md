Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 integers (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which is the input from the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, still 2. The stdin now contains t-5 integers, as one integer has been consumed by the input statement.
