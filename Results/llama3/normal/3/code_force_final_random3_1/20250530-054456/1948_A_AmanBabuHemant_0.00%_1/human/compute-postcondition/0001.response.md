The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `t` does not need to be adjusted. However, the state of `_` needs to be adjusted to be 0, since it will be the first value in the range of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t integers (1 <= n <= 50), `_` is 0**
