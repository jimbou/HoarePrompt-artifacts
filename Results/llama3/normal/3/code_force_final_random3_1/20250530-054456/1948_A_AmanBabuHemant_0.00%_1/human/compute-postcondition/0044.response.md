Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is t, stdin contains 0 integers (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` of '110' repeated n//2 times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 47 inclusive (since it started between 1 and 50 inclusive and was decremented by 1 in each iteration), the variable `n` will still be between 1 and 50 inclusive (since it is read from stdin in each iteration), and the variable `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t` (since it is incremented by 1 in each iteration). The stdin will contain 0 integers (since all integers have been read and processed). The loop will have printed 'NO' for odd values of `n`, and for even values of `n`, it will have printed 'YES' and the string `s` if the length of `s` is less than 200, otherwise it will have printed 'NO'.
