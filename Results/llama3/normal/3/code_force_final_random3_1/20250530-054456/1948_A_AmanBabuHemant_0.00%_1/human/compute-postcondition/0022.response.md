Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 1, `s` is a string of '110' repeated n//2 times, stdin contains t-3 integers (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a string that consists of the substring '110' repeated `n//2` times. The values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-3` integers.
