The code prints the string `s` which is composed of the string '110' repeated `n//2` times. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n//2` will be an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive. Therefore, the string `s` will be a repetition of '110' between 0 and 25 times.

Output: **'110' repeated between 0 and 25 times**
