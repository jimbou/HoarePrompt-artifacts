Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is even and greater than 0. In this case, the program prints 'YES' and a string of '1's and '0's, but the problem description requires the string to consist of uppercase Latin letters. The program does not meet this requirement.

For example, when n = 2, the program prints 'YES' and '110', but it should print 'YES' and 'MM' or any other string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly 2 special characters.
