This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer (t) represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer (n) represents the size of a string. For each test case, if n is odd, it prints 'NO'. If n is even, it creates a string of '110' repeated n//2 times and checks its length. If the length is less than 200, it prints 'YES' and the string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
