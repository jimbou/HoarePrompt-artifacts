Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which is the input from stdin. The value of `t` remains the same, an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The value of `_` also remains the same, which is 1. The stdin now contains t-3 integers, as one integer has been read and assigned to `n`.
