To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one integer `t` in the input, which is within the range of 1 to 10^4.

State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and t test cases, _ is 0**
