To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is the last element of `arr`, which means `arr` must have at least 1 element.

State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first element of arr, c is n, l is n - 1, r is 0, k is n - 1**
