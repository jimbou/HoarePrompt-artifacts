Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of at least 3 integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is the cube of the third element of `arr`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is the third element of `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the cube of the third element of `arr`, which is the result of multiplying the square of the third element of `arr` (its initial value) by the third element of `arr` (the value of `i`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
