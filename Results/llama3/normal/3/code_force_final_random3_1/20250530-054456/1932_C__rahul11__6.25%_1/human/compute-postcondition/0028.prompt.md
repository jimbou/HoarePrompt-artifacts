Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros, ans is the product of all elements in arr, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first one modulo `m` modulo `MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise the second element is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last one modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first one if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last one, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is 3 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `c` is 2, `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and the current value of `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is the product of all elements in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', otherwise the second element is the product of all elements in arr except the last one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', otherwise ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is 4 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise c is 3, l is 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise l is 0, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise r is n - 2, k is 1, and the current value of s[k] is either 'L' or not 'L'. If s[k] is 'L', then ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one. Otherwise, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, divided by arr[l] modulo MOD. r is decremented by 1 if s[k] is not 'L'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is at least 3, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is the product of all elements in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', otherwise the second element is the product of all elements in arr except the last one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', otherwise ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, _ is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is 5 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise c is 4, l is 2 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise l is 1, r is n - 2 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise r is n - 3, k is 2, and the current value of s[k] is either 'L' or not 'L'. If s[k] is 'L', then ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one. Otherwise, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, divided by arr[l] modulo MOD. res[c] is ans modulo m modulo MOD.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
