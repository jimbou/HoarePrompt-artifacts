Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is 1, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, i is undefined, c is undefined, k is undefined, l is undefined, r is undefined**

The code snippet provided reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr` and a list of characters `s`. It then initializes a list `res` of `n` zeros and sets `ans` to 1. The variables `i`, `c`, `k`, `l`, and `r` are no longer defined after the execution of the code. The value of `MOD` and `_` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 2.
