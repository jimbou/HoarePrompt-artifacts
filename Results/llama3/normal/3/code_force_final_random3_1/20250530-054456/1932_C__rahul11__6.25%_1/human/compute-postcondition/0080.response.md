Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the cth element is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, i is the last integer in the list arr, c is either 2 or 3, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, k is 1**

In this output state, the values of MOD, n, m, arr, s, stdin, i, _, l, and k remain unchanged. The value of ans is updated to be the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD. The value of res is updated to include the cth element as the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD. The value of r is decremented by 1.
