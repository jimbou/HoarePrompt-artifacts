The code multiplies the value of `ans` by `i`. Since `ans` is initially the second element of `arr` and `i` is also the second element of `arr`, `ans` is multiplied by itself. Therefore, `ans` becomes the square of the second element of `arr`.

Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is the square of the second element of `arr`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is the second element of `arr`.**
