Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is either 3 or 4, k is 2, res is a list of n integers, ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r, and l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 2 or n - 3**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `res[c]`, and `l`. The first line updates `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[l]`, taking the modulus with `MOD`, and assigning the result back to `ans`. The second line assigns the value of `ans` modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD` to `res[c]`. The third line increments `l` by 1. No other variables are affected.
