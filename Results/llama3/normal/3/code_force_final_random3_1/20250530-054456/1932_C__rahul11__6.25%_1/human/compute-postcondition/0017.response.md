Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first one modulo `m` modulo `MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise the second element is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last one modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first one if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last one, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is 3 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `c` is 2, `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and the current value of `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'.**

The value of `c` has been incremented by 1. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `c` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
