Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains zeros. In this case, the product of all elements will be zero, and the program will output zero for all commands. However, according to the problem description, the program should output the remainder of the product of all elements when divided by m, which can be non-zero even if the product is zero.

For example, if the input is:

4 6
3 0 4 2
LRRL

The program will output:

0 0 0 0

However, the correct output should be:

0 2 4 1

Because the product of all elements is zero, but the remainder of the product when divided by 6 is not zero.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
