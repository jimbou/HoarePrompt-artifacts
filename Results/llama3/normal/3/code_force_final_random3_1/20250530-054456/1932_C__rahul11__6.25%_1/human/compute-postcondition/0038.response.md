Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is the product of the first four elements of `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `k` is `n - 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of the first four elements of `arr`, instead of just the first three. All other variables remain unchanged.
