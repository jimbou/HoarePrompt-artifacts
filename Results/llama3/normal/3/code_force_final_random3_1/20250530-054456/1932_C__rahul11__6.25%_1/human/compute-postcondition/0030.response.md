The code prints the elements of the list `res` which contains the product of all elements in the list `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD` for the first element, and the product of all elements in the list `arr` except the corresponding element modulo `m` modulo `MOD` for the rest of the elements.

Output: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are the product of all elements in arr except the corresponding element modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - n + 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is n, l is n - 1, r is 0, k is n - 1, and the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the product of all elements in arr except the corresponding element modulo m modulo MOD are printed**
