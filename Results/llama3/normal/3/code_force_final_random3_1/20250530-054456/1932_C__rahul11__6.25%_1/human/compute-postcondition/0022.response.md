Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is the product of all elements in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', otherwise the second element is the product of all elements in arr except the last one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', otherwise ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is 4 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise c is 3, l is 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise l is 0, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise r is n - 2, k is 1, and the current value of s[k] is either 'L' or not 'L'. If s[k] is 'L', then ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one. Otherwise, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, divided by arr[l] modulo MOD. r is decremented by 1 if s[k] is not 'L'.**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` is 3 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `c` is 2, after the increment, `c` becomes 4 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `c` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
