Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of n integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is the last element of `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `MOD`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `res`, and `_` as in the initial state. The value of `ans` will be the product of all elements in the list `arr`, and the value of `i` will be the last element of `arr`.
