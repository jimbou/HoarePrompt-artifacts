To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for i in arr:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `arr` has at least 1 integer.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `i` should be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is the second element of `arr`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is the second element of `arr`.**
