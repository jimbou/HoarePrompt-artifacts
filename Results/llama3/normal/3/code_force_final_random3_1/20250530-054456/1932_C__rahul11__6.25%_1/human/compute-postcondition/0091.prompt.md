Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4). The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are the product of all elements in arr except the corresponding element modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t - n + 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is n, l is n - 1, r is 0, k is n - 1, and the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the product of all elements in arr except the corresponding element modulo m modulo MOD are printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is n, k is n - 1, l is n, r is -1, and the list res is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, _ is 2, stdin contains t - n + 1 test cases, i is the last integer in the list arr, c is n, k is n - 1, l is n - 1, r is 0, and the list res is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
