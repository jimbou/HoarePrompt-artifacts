Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is the first integer in the list arr, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, i is the first integer in the list arr, c is undefined, k is undefined, l is undefined, r is undefined**

The value of `ans` is updated by multiplying it with the first integer `i` in the list `arr`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - 3` test cases.
