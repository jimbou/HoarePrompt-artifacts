Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is `i`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is the first element of `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is the first element of the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to the first element of `arr`, and the rest of the variables retain their original values.
