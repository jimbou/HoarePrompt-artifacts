Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in the list arr, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, i is the last integer in the list arr, c is either 3 or 4, k is 1. If s[k] is 'L', then l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, and res[c] is the value of ans modulo m modulo MOD. Otherwise, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and the cth element of res is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, and ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD.**

The value of c is incremented by 1, so it can now be either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables remain the same.
