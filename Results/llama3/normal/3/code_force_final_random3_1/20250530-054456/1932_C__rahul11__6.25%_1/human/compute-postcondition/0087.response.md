Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in the list arr, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, i is the last integer in the list arr, k is 2. If s[k] is 'L', then l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, and res[c + 1] is the value of ans modulo m modulo MOD. Otherwise, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and the (c + 1)th element of res is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, and ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD, and c is either 4 or 5.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of c has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
