Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is the first element of arr, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first element of arr, c is n, l is n - 1, r is 0, k is n - 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of its previous value (which was 1) and the value of `i` (which is the first element of `arr`). The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
