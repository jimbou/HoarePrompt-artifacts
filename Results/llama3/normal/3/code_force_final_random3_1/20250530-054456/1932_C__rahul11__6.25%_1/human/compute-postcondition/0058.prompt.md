Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is the product of all elements in arr, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1, k is n - 1
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers, ans is the product of all elements in arr, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is either 2 or 3, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, k is 0. If s[k] is 'L', the first element of res is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the second element is the product of all elements in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one, l is 1, and r is n - 1. If s[k] is not 'L', the first element of res is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r modulo MOD, l is 0, and r is n - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is either 3 or 4, k is 1. If s[k] is 'L', then res is a list of n integers with the cth element being the product of all elements in arr except the lth element modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the lth element modulo MOD, and l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 1 or n - 2. Otherwise, res is a list of n integers with res[c] being the remainder of ans divided by m and MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r, and l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 2 or n - 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is either 4 or 5, k is 2, res is a list of n integers, and if s[k] is 'L', then l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r. Otherwise, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 3 or n - 4, and ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
