Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is either 3 or 4, k is 1. If s[k] is 'L', then res is a list of n integers with the cth element being the product of all elements in arr except the lth element modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the lth element modulo MOD, and l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 1 or n - 2. Otherwise, res is a list of n integers with res[c] being the remainder of ans divided by m and MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r, and l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 2 or n - 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of c has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 3 or 4. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
