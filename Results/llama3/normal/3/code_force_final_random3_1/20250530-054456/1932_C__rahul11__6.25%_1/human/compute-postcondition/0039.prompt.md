Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is n, l is n - 1, r is 0, k is n - 1, and the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the product of all elements in arr except the corresponding element modulo m modulo MOD are printed
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    ans *= i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is the first element of arr, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first element of arr, c is n, l is n - 1, r is 0, k is n - 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is the product of the first two elements of arr, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the second element of arr, c is n, l is n - 1, r is 0, k is n - 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is the product of the first four elements of `arr`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `k` is `n - 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
