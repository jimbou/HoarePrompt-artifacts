Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers (n and m) and a list of n integers, followed by a string of n characters ('L' and 'R'). The function calculates the product of the integers modulo m and MOD (1000000006), then iteratively updates this product based on the characters in the string, moving left or right through the list of integers. The final result is a list of n integers, which is printed to the console.**
