Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4). The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.**

The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value 1000000006. The values of the other variables and the contents of stdin are not affected by this code. The initial state of stdin remains the same, containing an integer t followed by t test cases, each consisting of three lines with specific constraints on the values of n, m, a_i, and s.
