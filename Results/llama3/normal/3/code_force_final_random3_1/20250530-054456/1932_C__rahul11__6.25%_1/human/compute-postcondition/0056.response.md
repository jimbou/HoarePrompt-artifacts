Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is either 3 or 4, k is 2, res is a list of n integers, and if s[k] is 'L', then l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r. Otherwise, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 3 or n - 4, and ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r - 1.***
