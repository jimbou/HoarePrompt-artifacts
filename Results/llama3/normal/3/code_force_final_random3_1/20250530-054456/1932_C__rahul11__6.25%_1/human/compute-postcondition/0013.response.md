Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is the product of all elements in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is 2, l is 1, r is n - 1, k is 0, and the current value of s[k] is 'L'.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of all elements in `arr` except the first one, by performing integer division of `ans` by `arr[l]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `res[c]` has been updated to be the product of all elements in `arr` except the first one, modulo `m`, modulo `MOD`. The value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The value of `c` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
