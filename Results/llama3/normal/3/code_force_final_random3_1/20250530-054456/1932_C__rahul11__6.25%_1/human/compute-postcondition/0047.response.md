Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers, ans is the product of all elements in arr, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is either 2 or 3, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, k is 0. If s[k] is 'L', the first element of res is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the second element is the product of all elements in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one, l is 1, and r is n - 1. If s[k] is not 'L', the first element of res is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the element at index r modulo MOD, l is 0, and r is n - 2.**

In this output state, the value of c has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
