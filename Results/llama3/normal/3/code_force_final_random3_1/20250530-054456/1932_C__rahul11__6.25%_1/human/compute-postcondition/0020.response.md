Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is the product of all elements in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', otherwise the second element is the product of all elements in arr except the last one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', otherwise ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is 3 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise c is 2, l is 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise l is 0, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise r is n - 2, k is 1, and the current value of s[k] is either 'L' or not 'L', ans is updated to be the product of all elements in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', otherwise ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, modulo MOD, and r is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of MOD, n, m, arr, s, res, _, stdin, i, c, l, and k remain unchanged. The value of ans is updated to be the product of all elements in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', otherwise ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, modulo MOD. The value of r is decremented by 1.
