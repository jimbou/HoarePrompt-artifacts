The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, which contains `n` integers.

Since the exact values of the integers in the `res` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the `n` integers in the `res` list.

Output: **[n integers in the res list]**
