The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list.

The `res` list is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is the product of all integers in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. The remaining elements in `res` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values.

However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **The product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, followed by n-1 unspecified integers**
