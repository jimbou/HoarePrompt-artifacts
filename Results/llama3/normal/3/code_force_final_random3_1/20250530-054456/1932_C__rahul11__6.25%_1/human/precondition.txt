The input contains an integer t, then t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a string s of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4, 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for all i. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
