Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of MOD remains unchanged at 1000000006. The variables n and m are assigned integer values from the input, which were previously stored in stdin. The variable arr is now a list of n integers, also obtained from the input. The variable s is a list of characters, which were input as a string. The variable res is a list of n zeros, initialized with the same length as arr. The variable ans is set to 1. The variable _ remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains t-1 test cases, as one test case has been processed.
