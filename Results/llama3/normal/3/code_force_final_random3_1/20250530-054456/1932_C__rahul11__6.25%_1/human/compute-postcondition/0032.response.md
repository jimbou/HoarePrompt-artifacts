Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n zeros, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is n, l is n - 1, r is 0, k is n - 1, and the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the product of all elements in arr except the corresponding element modulo m modulo MOD are printed**

The code block reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr` and a list of characters `s`. It then initializes a list `res` of `n` zeros and sets `ans` to 1. The values of `MOD`, `_`, `i`, `c`, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged. The product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD` and the product of all elements in `arr` except the corresponding element modulo `m` modulo `MOD` are printed.
