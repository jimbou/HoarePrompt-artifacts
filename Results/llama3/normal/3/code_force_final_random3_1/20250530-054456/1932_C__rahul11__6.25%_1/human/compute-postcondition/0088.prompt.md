Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is the product of all integers in the list arr, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, i is the last integer in the list arr, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1, k is undefined
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all integers in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is the product of all integers in the list `arr`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t` - 3 test cases, `i` is the last integer in the list `arr`, `c` is either 2 or 3, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is 'L', the second element of `res` is the product of all integers in `arr` except the first one modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, and `ans` is the product of all integers in the list `arr` except the first one. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all integers in the list `arr` divided by the last integer in the list `arr` modulo `MOD`, and `r` is `n` - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in the list arr, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, i is the last integer in the list arr, c is either 3 or 4, k is 1. If s[k] is 'L', then l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, and res[c] is the value of ans modulo m modulo MOD. Otherwise, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and the cth element of res is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, and ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in the list arr, _ is 2, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, i is the last integer in the list arr, k is 2. If s[k] is 'L', then l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, and res[c + 1] is the value of ans modulo m modulo MOD. Otherwise, l is either 0 or 1, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and the (c + 1)th element of res is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, and ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the rth element of arr modulo MOD, and c is either 4 or 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
