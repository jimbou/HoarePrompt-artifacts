The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list.

The `res` list contains `n` integers, where the first element is the product of all elements in the `arr` list modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, and the rest are the product of all elements in `arr` except the corresponding element modulo `m` modulo `MOD`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `m`, and `MOD` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `res` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated products.

Output: **product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, product of all elements in arr except the second element modulo m modulo MOD, ..., product of all elements in arr except the nth element modulo m modulo MOD**
