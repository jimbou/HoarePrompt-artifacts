Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros except the second element which is the product of all elements in arr except the last one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all elements in arr except the last one, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the last element of arr, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 2, k is 0, and s[k] is not 'L'.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of all elements in `arr` except the last one, modulo `MOD`. The value of `res[c]` has been updated to be the product of all elements in `arr` except the last one, modulo `m`, modulo `MOD`. The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
