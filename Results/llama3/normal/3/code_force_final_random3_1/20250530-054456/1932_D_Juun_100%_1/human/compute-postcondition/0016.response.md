Output State: **stdin contains at least one card, rank is the first element of the first card in the input, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is None, if suit is equal to trump, trumps is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input and the first element of the second card in the input, answers is a list containing one element which is a string of two characters, the first character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary and the second character is the rank of the first card in the input, if the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary is not None. Otherwise, answers is a list containing one element which is a string of two characters, the first character is the rank of the first card in the input and the second character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary.**

In this final state, the value of `suits[suit]` has been reset to `None`, and a new element has been appended to the `answers` list. The new element is a string of two characters, where the first character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the `suits` dictionary, and the second character is the rank of the first card in the input. If the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the `suits` dictionary is not `None`, the order of the characters in the string is determined by sorting the values. Otherwise, the order is determined by the original order of the values. The `trumps` list and the `stdin` input remain unchanged.
