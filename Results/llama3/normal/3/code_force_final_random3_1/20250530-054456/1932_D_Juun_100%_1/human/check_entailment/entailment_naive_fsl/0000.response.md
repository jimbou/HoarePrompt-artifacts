Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when there are two cards of the same suit but different ranks, and there are no trump cards left to beat the higher-ranked card. In this case, the program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" even though there is a possible sequence of rounds that might have been played in the game.

For example, consider the input:

3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

The program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" because it tries to use a trump card to beat the 9S, but there are no trump cards left. However, a possible sequence of rounds that might have been played in the game is:

3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
