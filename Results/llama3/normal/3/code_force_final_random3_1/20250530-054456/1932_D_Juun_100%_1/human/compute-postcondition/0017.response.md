Output State: **`stdin` contains at least one card, `rank` is the first element of the first card in the input, `suit` is the second element of the first card in the input, `trump` is a character (one of "CDHS"). If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input and the first element of the second card in the input, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of `suits[suit]` is `rank`. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string of two characters, the first character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary and the second character is the rank of the first card in the input, if the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary is not None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `suits[suit]` has been updated to `rank`, and the rest of the variables remain the same as in the initial state. The `suits` dictionary now has the value of `rank` for the key `suit`, which was previously `None`.
