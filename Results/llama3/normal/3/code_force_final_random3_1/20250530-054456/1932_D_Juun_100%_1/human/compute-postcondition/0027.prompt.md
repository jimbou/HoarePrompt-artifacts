Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one or more test cases minus one, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains at least one card, `rank` is the first element of the first card in the input, `suit` is the second element of the first card in the input, `trump` is a character (one of "CDHS"). If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string of two characters, the first character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary and the second character is the rank of the first card in the input, if the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary is not None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of `suits[suit]` is `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains at least one card, rank is the first element of the first card in the input, suit is the second element of the first card in the input, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"). If suit is equal to trump, trumps is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input and the first element of the second card in the input, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None. If suit is not equal to trump, trumps is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input, answers is a list containing one element which is a string of two characters, the first character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary and the second character is the rank of the first card in the input, if the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary is not None. Otherwise, answers is a list containing one element which is a string of two characters, the first character is the rank of the first card in the input and the second character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary. suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is rank.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` contains at least one card, `rank` is the first element of the second card in the input, `suit` is the second element of the second card in the input, `trump` is a character (one of "CDHS"), `trumps` is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input, the first element of the second card in the input if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input and the first element of the second card in the input, `answers` is a list containing one or two elements, the first element is a string of two characters, the first character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the `suits` dictionary and the second character is the rank of the first card in the input, if the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the `suits` dictionary is not None, otherwise the first element is a string of two characters, the first character is the rank of the first card in the input and the second character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the `suits` dictionary, if `suits[suit]` is not None, the second element is a string of two characters, the first character is the minimum of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, and the second character is `suit`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of `suits[suit]` is either `rank` or None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
