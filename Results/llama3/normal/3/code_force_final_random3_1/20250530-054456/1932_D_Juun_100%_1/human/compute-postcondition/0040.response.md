Postcondition: ***`trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to trump, and the list has one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, and it has one more pair of cards than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not None, `suit` is 'D'. If `rank` is None, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, the code continues to execute.***
