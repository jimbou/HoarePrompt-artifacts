Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, and all pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are trumps are printed, each pair followed by the suit of the pair.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `trumps` will be empty because all its elements have been popped and printed. The list `answers` will remain unchanged because it is not affected by the loop. The dictionary `suits` will also remain unchanged because it is not affected by the loop. Finally, all pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are trumps will have been printed, each pair followed by the suit of the pair.
