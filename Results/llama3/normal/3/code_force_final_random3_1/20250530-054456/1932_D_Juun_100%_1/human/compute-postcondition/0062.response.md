The only variable in the loop head is variable  answer, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `answers`. If `answers` has at least 3 pairs of cards the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` has at least 2 pairs of cards, `answer` is the second pair of cards in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 pairs of cards and the `answer` is the third pair of cards in the list.
State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of pairs of cards that must have at least 3 pairs, `answer` is the third pair of cards in the list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None**
