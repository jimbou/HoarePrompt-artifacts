Output State: **trumps is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to trump, answers is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of trumps contains all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to the trump suit. The list of answers contains all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, where each pair is represented as a string of two characters, the first character being the minimum of the two ranks and the second character being the suit. The dictionary of suits has all its values reset to None.
