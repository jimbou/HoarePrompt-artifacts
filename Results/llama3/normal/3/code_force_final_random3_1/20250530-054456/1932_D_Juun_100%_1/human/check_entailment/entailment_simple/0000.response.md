Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to reconstruct the rounds played in the game. It first separates the trump cards from the non-trump cards, then pairs the non-trump cards of the same suit, and finally pairs the trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with the non-trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE". The program also handles the case where there are multiple solutions by printing any of them.

Correctness: **True**
