Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to trump, and the list has one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, and it has one more pair of cards than before, the pair is in the format 'rankC trumps[-1]trump' where rank is the rank of a card with suit 'C' and trumps[-1] is the last rank of a card with suit equal to trump, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not None, `suit` is 'C'.**

In this output state, the list `trumps` has one less element than before because the `pop()` function removes the last element from the list. The list `answers` has one more pair of cards than before, and the new pair is in the format 'rankC trumps[-1]trump', where 'rank' is the rank of a card with suit 'C' and 'trumps[-1]' is the last rank of a card with suit equal to trump. The values of the other variables are not affected.
