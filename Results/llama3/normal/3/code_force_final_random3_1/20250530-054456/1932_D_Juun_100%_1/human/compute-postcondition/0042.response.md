Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to trump, and the list has one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, and it has one more pair of cards than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not None, `suit` is 'H' and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, and `suit` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.
