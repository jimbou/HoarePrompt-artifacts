Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, and all pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are trumps are printed, each pair followed by the suit of the pair.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of pairs of cards that must have at least 1 pair, `answer` is the first pair of cards in the list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, and the first pair of cards in the list which is `answer` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of pairs of cards that must have at least 2 pairs, `answer` is the second pair of cards in the list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, and the second pair of cards in the list `answers` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of pairs of cards that must have at least 3 pairs, `answer` is the third pair of cards in the list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, and the third pair of cards in the list `answers` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
