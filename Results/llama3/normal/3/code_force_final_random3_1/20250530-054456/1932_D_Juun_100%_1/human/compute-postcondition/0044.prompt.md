Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: trumps is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to trump, answers is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to trump, and the list has one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, and it has one more pair of cards than before, the pair is in the format 'rankC trumps[-1]trump' where rank is the rank of a card with suit 'C' and trumps[-1] is the last rank of a card with suit equal to trump, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not None, `suit` is 'C'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to trump, and the list has one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, and it has one more pair of cards than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not None, `suit` is 'D'. If `rank` is None, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, the code continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of the cards in the input that have the suit equal to trump, and the list has one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, and it has one more pair of cards than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not None, `suit` is 'H'. If `rank` is None, then we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
