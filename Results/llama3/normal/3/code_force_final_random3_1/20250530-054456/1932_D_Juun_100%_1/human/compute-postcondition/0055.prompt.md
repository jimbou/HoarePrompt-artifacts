Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is a non-empty list, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, and this is printed: "the last two elements of the list `trumps` are printed, each followed by the value of `trump`"
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `trumps` is a list with more than 2 elements, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, and this is printed: "the last two elements of the list `trumps` are printed, each followed by the value of `trump`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `trumps` is a list with more than 2 elements, `answers` is a list containing all the pairs of cards in the input that have the same suit and are not trumps, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, and this is printed: the last two elements of the list `trumps` are printed with the suit trump, where trump is the suit of the last two elements of the list `trumps`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
