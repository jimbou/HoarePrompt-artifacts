To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `answer` and the list `answers`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `answers` is a list of pairs of cards that must have at least 1 pair, and `answer` is the first pair of cards in the list. For the loop to execute again, `answers` must have at least 2 pairs of cards, and `answer` should be the second pair of cards in the list.

The other variables, `trumps`, `suits`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of pairs of cards that must have at least 2 pairs, `answer` is the second pair of cards in the list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None**
