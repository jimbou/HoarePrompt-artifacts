stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), the second line contains a single character representing the trump suit, and the third line contains a space-separated list of 2n unique cards, each represented by a two-character string.
