Functionality: **This function processes a set of card inputs, pairing cards of the same suit and printing them out. It first separates the input cards into trumps and non-trumps based on a given trump suit. Then, it pairs the non-trump cards of the same suit and prints them out. If there are any trumps, it pairs them up and prints them out as well. If there are not enough trumps to pair with the non-trump cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. The function does not return any value, but instead prints out the paired cards directly.**
