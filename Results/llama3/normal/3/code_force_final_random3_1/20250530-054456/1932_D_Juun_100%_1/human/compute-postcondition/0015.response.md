Output State: **`stdin` contains at least one card, `rank` is the first element of the first card in the input, `suit` is the second element of the first card in the input, `trump` is a character (one of "CDHS"). If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input and the first element of the second card in the input, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the first element of the first card in the input, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string of two characters, the first character is the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary and the second character is the rank of the first card in the input, if the value of the key corresponding to the suit of the first card in the input from the suits dictionary is not None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of `suits[suit]` is `rank`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the addition of the rank to the trumps list. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains at least one card, and the suits dictionary and answers list are unchanged.
