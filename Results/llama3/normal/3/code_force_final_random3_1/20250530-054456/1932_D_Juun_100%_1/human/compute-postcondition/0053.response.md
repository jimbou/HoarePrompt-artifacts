The code prints a formatted string containing two pairs of characters. The first pair consists of the last element of the `trumps` list and the value of `trump`. The second pair consists of the second last element of the `trumps` list and the value of `trump`. Since the exact elements of the `trumps` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the last two elements of the `trumps` list along with the value of `trump`.

Output: **the last element of the trumps list, the value of trump, the second last element of the trumps list, the value of trump**
