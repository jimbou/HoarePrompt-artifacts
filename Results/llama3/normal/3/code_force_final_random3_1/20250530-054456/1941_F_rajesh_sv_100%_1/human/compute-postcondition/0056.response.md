To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l < h`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than `h`, but we need to ensure that this condition still holds after the adjustment.

Since `l` is updated to `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h` after this update. This means `h` must be greater than `mid + 1`.

On the other hand, if `h` is updated to the average of `l` and its previous value, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h` after this update. This means `l` must be less than the average of `l` and its previous value.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` as follows:

* `l` must be less than the average of `l` and its previous value.
* `h` must be greater than `mid + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is less than the average of `l` and its previous value, `h` is greater than `mid + 1`, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next value in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**
