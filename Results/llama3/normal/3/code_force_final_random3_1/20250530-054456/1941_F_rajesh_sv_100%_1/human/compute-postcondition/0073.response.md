Output State: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The variable `mid` is assigned the average of `l` and `h`, which is calculated using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. The variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are assigned the values at indices `mid` and `mid + 1` in the list `D`, respectively, with the value of `f` added to each.
