The only variable in the loop head is variable `f`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f`. If there are more values in `F`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is either equal to `h` or `l` is less than `h` and `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another value in `F` to assign to `f`.
State: **`l` is either equal to `h` or `l` is less than `h` and `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next value in `F`**
