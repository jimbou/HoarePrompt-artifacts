The variables in the loop head are l and h, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l and h. If l is less than h, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is the average of the original l and h plus 1. Otherwise, h is the average of l and h. In both cases, the difference between mid_sum and left is either less than or greater than or equal to the difference between right and mid_next_sum.

For the loop to execute again, l must be less than h. Since l and h are updated based on the comparison of mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum, we need to ensure that this comparison does not result in l being greater than or equal to h.

Let's analyze the two cases:

1. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to be the average of the original l and h plus 1. In this case, l will be greater than the original l, but it may still be less than h if h is sufficiently large.
2. If mid_sum - left is greater than or equal to right - mid_next_sum, then h is updated to be the average of l and h. In this case, h will be less than the original h, but it may still be greater than l if l is sufficiently small.

To ensure that l is less than h, we need to adjust the values of l and h. Specifically, we need to ensure that the difference between mid_sum and left is not too large, and the difference between right and mid_next_sum is not too small.

State: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f, and the difference between mid_sum and left is not too large, and the difference between right and mid_next_sum is not too small**
