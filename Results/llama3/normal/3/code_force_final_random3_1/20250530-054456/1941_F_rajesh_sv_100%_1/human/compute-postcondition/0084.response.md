To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` so that `l` is still less than `h`.

From the given state, we know that if the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`, then `l` is greater than or equal to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to be the average of `l` and `h`.

To make sure `l` is less than `h`, we need to ensure that `h` is not updated to be less than or equal to `l`. This means that the condition for updating `h` should not be met. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is not less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `l` is not greater than or equal to `h`. Since `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, and `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, we can infer that `l` is less than `h` if `left - f` is less than `right - f`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f, and the difference between mid_sum and left is not less than the difference between right and mid_next_sum, and left - f is less than right - f**
