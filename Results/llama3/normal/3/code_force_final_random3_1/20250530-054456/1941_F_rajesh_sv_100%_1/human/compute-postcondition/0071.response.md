Output State: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next next value in F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f**

The code modifies the values of `l` and `h` by assigning them the results of the `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` functions, respectively. The `bisect_right` function returns the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, while the `bisect_left` function returns the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. The values of `ans`, `f`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.
