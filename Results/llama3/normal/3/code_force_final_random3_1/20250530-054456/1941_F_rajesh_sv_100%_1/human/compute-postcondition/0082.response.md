Output State: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the average of l and h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f, and the difference between mid_sum and left is not too large, and the difference between right and mid_next_sum is not too small.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be the average of `l` and `h`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the differences between `mid_sum` and `left`, and `right` and `mid_next_sum` are still valid.
