Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference, `next_max_diff` is less than `max_diff`, `index` is 1, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is equal to the difference between the second and first elements of `A`, `index` is None, and `i` is 1.***
