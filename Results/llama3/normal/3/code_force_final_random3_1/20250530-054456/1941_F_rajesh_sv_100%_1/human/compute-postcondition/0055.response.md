Postcondition: **`l` is less than `h`, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next value in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to the average of `l` and its previous value.**
