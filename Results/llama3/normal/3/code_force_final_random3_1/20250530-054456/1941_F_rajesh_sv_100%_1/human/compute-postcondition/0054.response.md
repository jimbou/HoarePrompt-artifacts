Output State: **`l` is less than `h`, `h` is the average of `l` and the previous value of `h`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next value in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be the average of `l` and the previous value of `h`, which is the new insertion point for `f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true.
