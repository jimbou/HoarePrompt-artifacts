To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `l < h`. This means we only need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` if necessary.

Given the states right before the loop:

- `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order.
- `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1.

For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than `h`. Since `l` and `h` are defined in terms of insertion points in a sorted order, and considering their definitions, it's clear that `l` is determined by `left - f` and `h` by `right - f`, with `h` being one less than its insertion point. This inherently suggests that `l` should be less than `h` for the loop condition to hold true, given the nature of how `l` and `h` are defined in relation to maintaining sorted order.

However, to explicitly ensure `l < h`, we must consider the scenario where `l` could potentially be equal to or greater than `h`, which would prevent the loop from executing. Given the definitions, if `left - f` and `right - f` are close or equal, it might not guarantee `l < h` without additional context on `D`, `left`, `right`, and `f`.

To guarantee the loop executes at least once without altering the fundamental definitions of `l` and `h` but ensuring the condition `l < h` is met, we need to consider the relationship between `left`, `right`, and `f`. If `right - f` is sufficiently greater than `left - f` to ensure their insertion points in `D` maintain a difference of at least 2 (considering `h` is one less than its insertion point), then `l < h` is guaranteed.

Thus, without altering the given states but ensuring the loop condition can be met, we acknowledge that the definitions of `l` and `h` inherently suggest a relationship where `l` can be less than `h`, but to explicitly guarantee this without additional context, we would need to ensure that the values of `left`, `right`, and `f` are such that the insertion points in `D` for `left - f` and `right - f` are sufficiently apart.

Given the information and focusing strictly on the loop condition `l < h`, the states provided do not necessarily need adjustment to ensure the loop can execute, assuming the natural progression of `l` and `h` based on their definitions would inherently meet the loop condition. However, to explicitly state adjustments for clarity and guarantee:

State: **`l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, and it is guaranteed that `l < h` based on the definitions and the relationship between `left`, `right`, and `f`.**

This adjustment emphasizes the need for `l` to be less than `h` based on their definitions and the context provided, without altering the fundamental states but ensuring the loop condition can be met for at least one iteration.
