Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, i is n-1, left is the element at index - 1 in A, right is the element at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, and h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `i` is `n-1`, `left` is the element at `index - 1` in `A`, `right` is the element at `index` in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `f` is the first element in `F`, `l` is either `mid + 1` or less than or equal to `h - 1`, `h` is either the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus one or `mid`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, if `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, i is n-1, left is the element at index - 1 in A, right is the element at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is set to mid + 1. Otherwise, l is set to either mid + 1 or less than or equal to h - 1, and l must be less than h.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, i is n-1, left is the element at index - 1 in A, right is the element at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
