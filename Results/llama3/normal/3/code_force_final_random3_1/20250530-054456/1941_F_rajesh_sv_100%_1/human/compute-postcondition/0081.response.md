Output State: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f, and the difference between mid_sum and left is not too large, and the difference between right and mid_next_sum is not too small, and l is greater than or equal to mid + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` has been updated to be at least `mid + 1`, while the values of `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The conditions that the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is not too large, and the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum` is not too small, are still valid.
