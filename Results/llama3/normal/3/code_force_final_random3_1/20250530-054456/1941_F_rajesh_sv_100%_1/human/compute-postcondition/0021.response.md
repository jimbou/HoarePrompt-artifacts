Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is equal to the previous value of `max_diff`, `max_diff` is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`, and `index` is 3. If `diff` is not greater than `max_diff` but is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`.***
