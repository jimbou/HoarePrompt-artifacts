Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference, `next_max_diff` is less than `max_diff`, and `index` is 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is equal to the difference between the second and first elements of `A`, and `index` is 1 if the difference is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is None. In both cases, `i` is 2.**
