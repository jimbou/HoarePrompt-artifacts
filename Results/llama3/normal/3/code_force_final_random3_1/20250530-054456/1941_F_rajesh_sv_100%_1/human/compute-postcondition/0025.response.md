Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, i is n-1, left is the element at index - 1 in A, right is the element at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, and h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one.**

The code calculates the insertion points for `left - f` and `right - f` in the sorted list `D` using the `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` functions, respectively. The values of `l` and `h` are determined based on the positions where these values would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties.
