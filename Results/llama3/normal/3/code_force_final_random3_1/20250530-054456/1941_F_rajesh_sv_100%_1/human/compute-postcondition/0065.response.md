Postcondition: ***l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is the average of the original l and h plus 1, and h is greater than l. Otherwise, h is equal to mid.***
