Postcondition: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f. The current value of mid_sum minus left is less than right minus mid_next_sum.**
