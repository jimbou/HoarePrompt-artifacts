Output State: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f, and the difference between mid_sum and left is not less than the difference between right and mid_next_sum, and left - f is less than right - f, and l is greater than or equal to mid + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order is now greater than or equal to mid + 1. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
