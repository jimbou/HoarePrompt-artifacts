Output State: **l is equal to h, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the last value in F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `l` is equal to `h`, and the variable `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The variable `f` is the last value in the list `F`. The variable `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`. The variable `mid_sum` is the value at index `mid` in `D` plus `f`, and the variable `mid_next_sum` is the value at index `mid + 1` in `D` plus `f`.
