Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `i` is `n-1`, `left` is the element at `index - 1` in `A`, `right` is the element at `index` in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `f` is the first element in `F`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus one, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f.**

The value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
