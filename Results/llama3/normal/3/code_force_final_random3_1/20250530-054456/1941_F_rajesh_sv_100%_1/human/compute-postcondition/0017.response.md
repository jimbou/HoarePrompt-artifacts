Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`**

In this output state, the value of `diff` is calculated as the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of list `A`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
