To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for f in F:`. The only variable in the loop head is `f`, which is the next value in the list `F`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `f`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there is a next value in the list `F`. Since `f` is the next value in `F` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to move to the next value in `F` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l]` + `f` - `left` and `right` - `D[l]` - `f`, `f` is the next next value in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid]` + `f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1]` + `f`**
