Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, i is n-1, left is the element at index - 1 in A, right is the element at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is less than mid, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f, h is the average of l and h.**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables keep their initial values except for h, which is now equal to the average of l and h.
