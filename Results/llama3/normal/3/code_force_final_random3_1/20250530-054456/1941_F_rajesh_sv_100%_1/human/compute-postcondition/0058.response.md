Output State: **`l` is updated to be `mid + 1`, `h` is greater than `mid + 1`, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next value in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l` is no longer less than the average of `l` and its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` is updated to be one more than the current `mid` value. The other variables remain unchanged, but the relationship between `l` and its previous value is no longer valid.
