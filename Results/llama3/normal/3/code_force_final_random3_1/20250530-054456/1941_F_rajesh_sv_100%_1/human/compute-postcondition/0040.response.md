Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `i` is `n-1`, `left` is the element at `index - 1` in `A`, `right` is the element at `index` in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `f` is the first element in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, `mid_next_sum` is the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, and `l` is less than `h`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `h` is still maintained, with `l` being less than `h`.
