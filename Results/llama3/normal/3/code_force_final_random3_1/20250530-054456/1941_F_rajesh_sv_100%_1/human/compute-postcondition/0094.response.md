To determine what will be printed when the statement `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` executes, let's break down the variables involved based on the given initial state:

1. **ans**: This is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of two expressions: `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Since `l` is equal to `h`, and without specific values for `D[l]`, `f`, `left`, and `right`, we can't compute an exact numerical value for `ans`. However, we know it's a value that results from comparing and minimizing these expressions.

2. **next_max_diff**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we can't directly infer its value. However, based on the context, it seems to represent another difference or comparison value, possibly related to the differences between elements in `D` and other variables like `f`, `left`, and `right`.

Given these considerations, the `print` statement will output the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`. Since we don't have explicit values for these variables, we can describe the output in terms of the variables and operations involved.

Output: **The maximum value between the minimum of the previous value of ans and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, and next_max_diff**
