Postcondition: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f, and the difference between mid_sum and left is not too large, and the difference between right and mid_next_sum is not too small. If the difference between mid_sum and left is less than the difference between right and mid_next_sum, then l is greater than or equal to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to be the average of l and h.**
