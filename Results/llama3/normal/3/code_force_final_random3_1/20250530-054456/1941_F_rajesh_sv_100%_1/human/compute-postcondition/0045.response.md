Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, and previously `l` was either equal to `h` or `l` was less than `h` and `mid_sum - left` was not less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of two expressions involving `D[l]`, `f`, `left`, and `right`. The relationship between `l` and `h` remains the same, and the previous condition involving `mid_sum`, `left`, `right`, and `mid_next_sum` is still valid.
