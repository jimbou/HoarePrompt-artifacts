Output State: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f, and the difference between mid_sum and left is not less than the difference between right and mid_next_sum, and left - f is less than right - f.**

The code updates the values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` based on the values of `l`, `h`, and `D`. The new value of `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, which is calculated using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. The new values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are the values at indices `mid` and `mid + 1` in `D`, respectively, plus `f`. The other variables, `l`, `h`, `left`, `right`, and `f`, remain unchanged.
