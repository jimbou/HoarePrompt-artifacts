Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l]` + `f` - `left` and `right` - `D[l]` - `f`, `f` is the next value in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid]` + `f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1]` + `f`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l]` + `f` - `left` and `right` - `D[l]` - `f`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the relationship between `l` and `h` remains the same.
