Postcondition: **l, h, ans, f, mid, mid_sum, and mid_next_sum are updated based on the condition mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum. If the condition is true, l is updated to mid + 1, and if the condition is false, h is updated to be the average of l and h. In both cases, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next value in F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. Additionally, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, and l is no longer less than the average of l and its previous value if the condition is true.**
