Output State: **l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f.**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `l` and `h`, which is a result of the first line of code. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are calculated based on the values of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`, which are results of the second line of code. The condition `l < h` is maintained throughout the updates, as specified in the initial state.
