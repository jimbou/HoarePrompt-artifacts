Output State: **n is at least 3, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers, max_diff is equal to the difference between the second and first elements of A, next_max_diff is less than max_diff, index is 2, and i is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `max_diff` is updated to the difference between the second and first elements of `A`, which is a positive integer. The value of `next_max_diff` is less than `max_diff`, indicating that it is also a positive integer. The value of `index` is updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The value of `i` remains 2 as it is not modified by the code.
