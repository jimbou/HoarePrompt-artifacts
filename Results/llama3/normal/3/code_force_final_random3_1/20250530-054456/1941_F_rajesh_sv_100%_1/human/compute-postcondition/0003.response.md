To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(testcases):`. The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `testcases` must be greater than 1.

State: **`testcases` is at least 2**
