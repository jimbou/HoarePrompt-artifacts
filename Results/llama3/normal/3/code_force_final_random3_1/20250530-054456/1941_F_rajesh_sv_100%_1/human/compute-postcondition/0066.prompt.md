Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next value in F
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is less than `h`, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next value in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to the average of `l` and its previous value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: l, h, ans, f, mid, mid_sum, and mid_next_sum are updated based on the condition mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum. If the condition is true, l is updated to mid + 1, and if the condition is false, h is updated to be the average of l and h. In both cases, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next value in F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. Additionally, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, and l is no longer less than the average of l and its previous value if the condition is true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is the average of the original l and h plus 1, and h is greater than l. Otherwise, h is equal to mid.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
