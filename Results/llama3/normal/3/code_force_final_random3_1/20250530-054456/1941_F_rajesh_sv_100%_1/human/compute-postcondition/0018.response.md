Output State: **n is at least 4, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers, i is 3, diff is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of A, next_max_diff is equal to the previous value of max_diff, max_diff is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of A, index is 3.**

In this final state, all variables retain their initial values except for `next_max_diff`, `max_diff`, and `index`. The value of `next_max_diff` is set to the previous value of `max_diff`, but since `max_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff` (the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`), `next_max_diff` effectively takes the value that `max_diff` had before the code execution. The value of `max_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`, which is the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`. The value of `index` is set to the value of `i`, which is 3.
