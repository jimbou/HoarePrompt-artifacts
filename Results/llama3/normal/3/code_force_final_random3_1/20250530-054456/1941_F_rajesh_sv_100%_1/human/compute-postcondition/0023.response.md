Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, i is n-1, left is the element at index - 1 in A, right is the element at index in A, and ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A.**

The code snippet assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` to `left` and `right`, respectively, and assigns the value of `max_diff` to `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, and `i` remain unchanged.
