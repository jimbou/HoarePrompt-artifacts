Output State: **l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f, and the difference between mid_sum and left is not too large, and the difference between right and mid_next_sum is not too small**

The code snippet modifies the values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`. The first line recalculates `mid` as the average of `l` and `h`, which is a new value. The second line updates `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by adding `f` to the values at indices `mid` and `mid + 1` in list `D`, respectively. The values of `l`, `h`, and the conditions regarding the differences between `mid_sum`, `left`, `right`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.
