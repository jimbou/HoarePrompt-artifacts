The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference, `next_max_diff` is less than `max_diff`, `index` is 1, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is equal to the difference between the second and first elements of `A`, `index` is None, and `i` is 2.**
