Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, i is n-1, left is the element at index - 1 in A, right is the element at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid.***
