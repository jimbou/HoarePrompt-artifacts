Output State: **`l` is now `mid + 1`, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next value in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The current value of `mid_sum` minus `left` is less than the current value of `right` minus `mid_next_sum`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` with respect to `left` and `right` is still valid.
