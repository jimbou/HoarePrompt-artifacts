Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, and i is n-1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variables max_diff, next_max_diff, and index have been updated accordingly. The maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A is stored in max_diff, the second maximum difference is stored in next_max_diff, and the index of the maximum difference is stored in index. The loop counter i has reached its final value of n-1. The other variables n, m, k, A, D, and F remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
