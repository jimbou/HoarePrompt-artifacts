Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`, which is unknown since the function's behavior is not specified**

In this output state, the value of `testcases` has been updated to the value returned by the function `func_3()`. However, since the behavior of `func_3()` is not specified, the exact value of `testcases` is unknown. The fact that `testcases` was initially a positive integer is no longer relevant, as its value has been overwritten by the result of `func_3()`.
