Postcondition: ***l is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the value at index mid in D plus f, and mid_next_sum is the value at index mid + 1 in D plus f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is the average of the original l and h plus 1. Otherwise, h is the average of l and h. In both cases, the difference between mid_sum and left is either less than or greater than or equal to the difference between right and mid_next_sum.***
