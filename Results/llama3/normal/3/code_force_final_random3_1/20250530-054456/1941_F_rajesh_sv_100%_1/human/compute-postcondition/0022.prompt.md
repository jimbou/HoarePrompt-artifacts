Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of non-negative integers, max_diff is -inf, next_max_diff is -inf, and index is None.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        next_max_diff = max_diff
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference, `next_max_diff` is less than `max_diff`, `index` is 1, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is equal to the difference between the second and first elements of `A`, `index` is None, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference, `next_max_diff` is less than `max_diff`, and `index` is 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is equal to the difference between the second and first elements of `A`, and `index` is 1 if the difference is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is None. In both cases, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of non-negative integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is equal to the previous value of `max_diff`, `max_diff` is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`, and `index` is 3. If `diff` is not greater than `max_diff` but is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is equal to the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of `A`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
