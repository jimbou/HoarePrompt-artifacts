Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

- If n is odd and 2a is less than b, it prints the product of a and n, which is the minimum cost because buying two yogurts at the promotion price would be more expensive.
- If n is odd and 2a is not less than b, it prints the value of the expression n // 2 * b + a, which is the minimum cost because buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper.
- If n is even and 2a is less than b, it prints the product of a and n, which is the minimum cost because buying two yogurts at the promotion price would be more expensive.
- If n is even and 2a is not less than b, it prints n * b / 2, which is the minimum cost because buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper.

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for all possible cases and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
