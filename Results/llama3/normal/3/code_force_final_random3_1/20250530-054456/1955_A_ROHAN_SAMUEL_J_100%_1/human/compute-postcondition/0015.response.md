The code prints the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`, where `n` is a positive even integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `b` is an integer.

Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer (i.e., the integer division of `n` by 2). The result of `n // 2 * b` will be the product of this integer and `b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is a positive even integer between 1 and 10^4, and b is an integer)**
