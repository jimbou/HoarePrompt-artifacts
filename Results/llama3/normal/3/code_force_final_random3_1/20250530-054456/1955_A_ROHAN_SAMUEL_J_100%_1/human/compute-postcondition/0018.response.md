Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains `n-2` inputs. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even, then if `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise `n * b / 2` is printed.***
