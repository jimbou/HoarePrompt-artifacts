Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the rest t inputs are three space-separated positive integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2:
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
    elif 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains `n-2` inputs. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even, then if `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise `n * b / 2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^4), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `_` is 1, stdin contains `n-3` inputs. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even, then if `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise `n * b / 2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer (3 <= n <= 10^4), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains `n-4` inputs. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even and `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is even and `2a` is not less than `b`, `n * b / 2` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
