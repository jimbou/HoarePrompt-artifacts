Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^4), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `_` is 1, stdin contains `n-3` inputs. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even and `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is even and `2a` is not less than `b`, `n * b / 2` is printed.***
