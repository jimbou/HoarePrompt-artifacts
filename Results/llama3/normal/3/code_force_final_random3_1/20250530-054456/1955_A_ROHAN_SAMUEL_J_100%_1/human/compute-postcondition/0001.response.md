The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` accepts three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The stdin initially contains `t+1` inputs, where the first input is a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). Since `n, a, b` are assigned the first three inputs, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, and `a` and `b` are assigned the next two inputs. The remaining inputs in stdin are `t-2` inputs.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains `n-2` inputs.**
