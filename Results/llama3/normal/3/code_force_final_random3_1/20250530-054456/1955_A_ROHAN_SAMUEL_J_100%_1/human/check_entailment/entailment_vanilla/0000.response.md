Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price of one yogurt (a), and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b).
3. It checks if the number of yogurts is odd (n % 2). If it is, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts on promotion (b). If it is, it calculates the total cost as the number of yogurts times the price of one yogurt (a * n). Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as the number of pairs of yogurts times the price of two yogurts on promotion (n // 2 * b) plus the price of one yogurt (a).
4. If the number of yogurts is even (n % 2 == 0), it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts on promotion (b). If it is, it calculates the total cost as the number of yogurts times the price of one yogurt (a * n). Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as the number of pairs of yogurts times the price of two yogurts on promotion (n // 2 * b).
5. The program prints the calculated total cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
