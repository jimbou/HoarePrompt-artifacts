Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^4), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `_` is 1, stdin contains `n-3` inputs. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even, then if `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise `n * b / 2` is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the input values from stdin, and the stdin now contains `n-3` inputs. The conditions for printing the product of `a` and `n` or the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` or `n * b / 2` are still valid, depending on whether `n` is odd or even and the relationship between `2a` and `b`.
