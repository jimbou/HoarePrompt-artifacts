The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^4). For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^4), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains `n-2` inputs. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even, then if `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise `n * b / 2` is printed.**
