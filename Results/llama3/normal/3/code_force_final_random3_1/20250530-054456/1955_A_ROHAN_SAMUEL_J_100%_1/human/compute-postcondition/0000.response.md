To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the `input()` function.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `input()` returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0. Since `stdin` contains `t+1` inputs, we need to ensure that the first input is a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), _ is 0**

Note that we've adjusted the state to ensure that the first input is a positive integer `t`, which will allow the loop to execute. We've also initialized the variable `_` to 0, as it will take on the value of the input in each iteration.
