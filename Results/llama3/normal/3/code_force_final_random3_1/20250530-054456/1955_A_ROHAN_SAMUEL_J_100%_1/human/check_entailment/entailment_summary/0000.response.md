Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program checks if n is odd or even and then compares the prices of buying two yogurts at the regular price (2a) and the promotion price (b). Based on these conditions, it calculates and prints the minimum cost.

Correctness: **True**
