Output State: **`_` is `t`, stdin contains no inputs. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even and `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is even and `2a` is not less than `b`, `n * b / 2` is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all `t` iterations, and the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `t`. The stdin input has been fully consumed, leaving no remaining inputs. The output state also describes the possible values printed during the loop's execution, which depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` in each iteration.
