Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 <= n <= 10^4), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `_` is 2, stdin contains `n-4` inputs. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even, then if `2a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed, otherwise `n * b / 2` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the input values, and the stdin now contains `n-4` inputs. The conditions for printing the product of `a` and `n` or the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` or `n * b / 2` are still valid, depending on whether `n` is odd or even and the comparison of `2a` and `b`.
