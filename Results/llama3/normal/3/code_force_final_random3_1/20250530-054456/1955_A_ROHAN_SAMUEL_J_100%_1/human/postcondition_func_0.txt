This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where each input consists of three positive integers n, a, and b. It then prints the result of a calculation based on the values of n, a, and b. If n is odd and 2a is less than b, it prints the product of a and n. If n is odd and 2a is not less than b, it prints the value of the expression n // 2 * b + a. If n is even and 2a is less than b, it prints the product of a and n. If n is even and 2a is not less than b, it prints n * b / 2. The function repeats this process for a number of iterations specified by the first input, and then terminates, leaving stdin empty.
