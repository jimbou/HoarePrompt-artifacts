Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: when n is odd and when n is even. When n is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price. When n is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price. If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1 or 2. It also correctly handles the case where a is greater than b, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description but is still a valid input.
