Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive).
* `a` and `b` are integers.
* The value of `_` is 2, but it is not used in the code snippet.
* The stdin contains `n-4` inputs, but this information is not relevant to the code snippet.

The code snippet is a simple print statement: `print(a * n)`.

Since there are no conditional statements or loops in the code snippet, the output will always be the product of `a` and `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the product of the integer `a` and the positive integer `n`, which is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output: **a * n (where a is an integer and n is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4)**
