Based on the precondition, we know that `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, and `b` is an integer. The print statement is `print(n // 2 * b)`.

Since the precondition does not provide explicit values for `n` and `b`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression `n // 2 * b`. However, we can describe the value of the expression based on the given information.

The expression `n // 2` calculates the integer division of `n` by 2, which will result in the integer part of the quotient. This value is then multiplied by `b`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the product of the integer part of `n` divided by 2 and the value of `b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, and b is an integer)**
