Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program iterates over each test case, reads the input values n, a, and b, and then applies the following logic:

- If n is odd, it checks if 2 * a is less than b. If true, it prints the product of a and n. Otherwise, it prints the value of the expression n // 2 * b + a.
- If n is even, it checks if 2 * a is less than b. If true, it prints the product of a and n. Otherwise, it prints the value of the expression n // 2 * b.

This logic correctly implements the problem's requirements. When n is odd, it's optimal to buy either all yogurts at the regular price a or buy pairs of yogurts at the promotion price b and one yogurt at the regular price a. When n is even, it's optimal to buy either all yogurts at the regular price a or buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price b.

Correctness: **True**
