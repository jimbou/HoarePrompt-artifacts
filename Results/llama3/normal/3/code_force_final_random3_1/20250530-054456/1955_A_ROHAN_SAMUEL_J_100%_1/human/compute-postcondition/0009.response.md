Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains `n-2` inputs. The current value of `n` is odd. If `2 * a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is being printed, where `a * n` is the product of an integer `a` and an odd positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^4). Otherwise, the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is being printed.**
