Output: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains `n-2` inputs. `n` is even. The current value of `2a` is less than the current value of `b`, and the product of `a` and `n` is being printed, where `a` is an integer and `n` is a positive even integer (1 <= n <= 10^4)**
