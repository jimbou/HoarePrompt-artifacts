This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers. It then finds the minimum length of a subsequence of consecutive equal elements in the list. If all elements in the list are equal, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of the subsequence. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.
