According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and n is greater than 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed.**
