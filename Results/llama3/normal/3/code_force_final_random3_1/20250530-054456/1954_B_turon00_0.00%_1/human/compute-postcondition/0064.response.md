Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and cnt, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of ans and cnt is being printed. If the length of aa is 1, then -1 is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is now 0, `ans` will be either its original value or 0, depending on its original value. The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
