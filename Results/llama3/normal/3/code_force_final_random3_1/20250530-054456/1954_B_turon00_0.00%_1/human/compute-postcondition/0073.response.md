Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is either 0 or a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed**
