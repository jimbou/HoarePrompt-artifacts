Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer greater than 1, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt, cnt is 0**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the original value of `cnt`, and the value of `cnt` is reset to 0.
