To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it will be the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**
