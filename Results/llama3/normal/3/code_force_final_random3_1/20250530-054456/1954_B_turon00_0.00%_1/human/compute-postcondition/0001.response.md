To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range of `t`).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, we need to specify the value of `_` for the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, `_` will take on the value of the first iteration, which is 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains positive integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
