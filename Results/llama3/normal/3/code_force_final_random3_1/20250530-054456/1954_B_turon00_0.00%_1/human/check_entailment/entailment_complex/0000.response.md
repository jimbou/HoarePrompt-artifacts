Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` positive integers.
2.  It initializes a set `aa` with the elements of the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, it means all elements in the list are equal, and the program correctly prints -1.
3.  The program then iterates through the list `a` and keeps track of the count of consecutive equal elements in the variable `cnt`. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the answer `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
4.  After iterating through the entire list, the program updates `ans` one more time with the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, to account for the last sequence of consecutive equal elements.
5.  Finally, the program prints the answer `ans`, which is the minimum length of a subsequence of consecutive equal elements in the list.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when all elements in the list are equal, and when there are multiple sequences of consecutive equal elements.

Correctness: **True**
