Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is 0, ans is a positive integer equal to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of its original value and 0, `i` is `n-1`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `i` is `n`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is either 1 or 2 and `ans` is a positive integer equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of its original value and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `i` is `n+1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
