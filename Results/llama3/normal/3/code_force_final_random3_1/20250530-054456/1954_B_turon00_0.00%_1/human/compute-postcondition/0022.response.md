Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is 0, ans is a positive integer equal to the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cnt` is reset to 0.
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`.
- The loop counter `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
