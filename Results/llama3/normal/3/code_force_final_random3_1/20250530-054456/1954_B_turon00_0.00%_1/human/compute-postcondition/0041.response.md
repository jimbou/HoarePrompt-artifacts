Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `i` is `n`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is either 1 or 2 and `ans` is a positive integer equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of its original value and 0.***
