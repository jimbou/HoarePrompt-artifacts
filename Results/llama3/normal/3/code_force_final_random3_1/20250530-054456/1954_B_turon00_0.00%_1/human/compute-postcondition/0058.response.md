Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `tmp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the same state, with the same values for `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `ans`, and `i`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is still being printed, and if the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is still printed. The current value of `a[i]` is still equal to the current value of `tmp`.
