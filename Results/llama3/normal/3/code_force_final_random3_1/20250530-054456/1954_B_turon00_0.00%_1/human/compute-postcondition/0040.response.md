Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of its original value and 0, i is n**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is a positive integer equal to `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of its original value and 0, the value of `ans` will be either 0 or its original value, whichever is smaller. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain unchanged.
