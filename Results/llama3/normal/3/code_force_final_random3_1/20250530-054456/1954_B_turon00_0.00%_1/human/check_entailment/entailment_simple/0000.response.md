Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1 because it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

2. If not all elements are the same, it initializes a variable `cnt` to 0 and `ans` to the length of the array. It then iterates over the array, incrementing `cnt` whenever it encounters an element that is the same as the first element of the array, and updating `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` whenever it encounters an element that is different from the first element of the array.

3. After the loop, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` one more time to account for the case where the last elements of the array are the same as the first element.

4. Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
