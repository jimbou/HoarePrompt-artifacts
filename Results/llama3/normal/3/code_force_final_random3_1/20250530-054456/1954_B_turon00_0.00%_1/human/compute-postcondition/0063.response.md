Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed. Additionally, if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2, otherwise `cnt` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is now either 1 or 2, depending on its previous value. The rest of the conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state.
