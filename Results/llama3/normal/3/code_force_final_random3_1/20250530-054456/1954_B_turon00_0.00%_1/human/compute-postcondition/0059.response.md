Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed. Additionally, the value of `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.***
