Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original value of ans and cnt, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of ans and cnt is being printed. If the length of aa is 1, then -1 is printed. Additionally, the value of a[i] is not equal to tmp.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, which was 0. The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed. Additionally, the value of `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.
