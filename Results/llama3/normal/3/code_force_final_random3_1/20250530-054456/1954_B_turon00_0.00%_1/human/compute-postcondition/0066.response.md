State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed. Additionally, if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2, otherwise if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` and `cnt` was originally 1 then `cnt` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0.**
