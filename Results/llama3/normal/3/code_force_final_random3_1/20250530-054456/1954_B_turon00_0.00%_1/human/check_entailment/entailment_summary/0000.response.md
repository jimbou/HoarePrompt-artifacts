Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.
2.  If the array contains different elements, the program iterates through the array and keeps track of the length of the current subsequence of consecutive equal elements.
3.  Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum length of the subsequence found so far.
4.  Finally, it prints the minimum length of the subsequence, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
