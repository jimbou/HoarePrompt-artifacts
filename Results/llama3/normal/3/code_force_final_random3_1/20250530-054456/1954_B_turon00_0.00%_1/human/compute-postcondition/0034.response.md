Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` was 0, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` is still valid after the code has been executed.
