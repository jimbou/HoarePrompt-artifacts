Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is 0, ans is 0, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `n` is updated to a positive integer, which is the input from stdin. The value of `a` is updated to a list of positive integers, which is the input from stdin. The value of `tmp` is updated to a positive integer, which is the first element of the list `a`. The value of `aa` is updated to a set of positive integers, which is the set of elements in the list `a`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged as 0. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as 0, which is the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. The value of `i` is updated to `n`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, as two inputs have been read.
