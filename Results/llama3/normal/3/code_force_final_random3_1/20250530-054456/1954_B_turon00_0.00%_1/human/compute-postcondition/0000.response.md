Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains positive integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two inputs: an integer representing the length of the list and the list of positive integers itself. The sum of the lengths of all lists over all test cases remains within the limit of 3 * 10^5.
