Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is either 0 or a positive integer, ans is a positive integer equal to the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in a, i is -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `aa` remain unchanged.
- The variable `cnt` is either 0 or a positive integer, depending on whether the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`.
- The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a`.
- The variable `i` is decremented to -1 after the loop finishes executing.
- The state of stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus two.
