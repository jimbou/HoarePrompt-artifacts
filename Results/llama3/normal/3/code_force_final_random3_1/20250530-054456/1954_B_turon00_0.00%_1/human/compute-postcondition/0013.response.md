Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is a positive integer equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of its original value and 0.***
