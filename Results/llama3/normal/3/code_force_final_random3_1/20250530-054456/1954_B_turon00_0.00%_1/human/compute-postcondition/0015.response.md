The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `cnt` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `cnt` is increased by 1**
