Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has more than two distinct elements. In this case, the program only checks for the minimum count of the first element, but it does not consider the minimum count of other elements.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3, because we need to remove at least 3 elements to make the array not beautiful.

The program should be modified to find the minimum count of all distinct elements, not just the first element.
