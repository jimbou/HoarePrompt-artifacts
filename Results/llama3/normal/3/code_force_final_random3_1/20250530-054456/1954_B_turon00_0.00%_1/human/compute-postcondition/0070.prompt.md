Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 2, n is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is 0, ans is n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of ans and cnt is being printed. If the length of aa is 1, then -1 is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed. Additionally, if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed. Additionally, if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2, otherwise if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` and `cnt` was originally 1 then `cnt` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `ans` is either `n` or the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed. If the length of `aa` is 1, then -1 is printed. Additionally, if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2, otherwise if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` and `cnt` was originally 1 then `cnt` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
