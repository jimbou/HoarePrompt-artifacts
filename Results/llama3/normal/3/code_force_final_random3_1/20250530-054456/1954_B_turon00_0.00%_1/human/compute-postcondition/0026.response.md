To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` which is equal to 0 is being printed**
