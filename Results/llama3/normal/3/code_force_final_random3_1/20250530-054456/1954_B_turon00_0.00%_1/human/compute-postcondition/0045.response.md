Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `i` is `n+1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.***
