The code snippet consists of two lines: `cnt = 0` and `ans = n`. 

The first line assigns the value 0 to `cnt`. Since `cnt` was previously 0, its value remains unchanged.

The second line assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `ans` becomes a positive integer equal to the value of `n`.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, tmp is a positive integer, aa is a set of positive integers, cnt is 0, ans is a positive integer equal to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
