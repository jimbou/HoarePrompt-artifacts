To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and the value of `t` needs to be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `cnt` is either 0 or a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, `i` is -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed**
