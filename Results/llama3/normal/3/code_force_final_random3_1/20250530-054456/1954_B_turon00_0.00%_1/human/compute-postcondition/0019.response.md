The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `cnt`, so we can only conclude that `cnt` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of positive integers, `tmp` is a positive integer, `aa` is a set of positive integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1**
