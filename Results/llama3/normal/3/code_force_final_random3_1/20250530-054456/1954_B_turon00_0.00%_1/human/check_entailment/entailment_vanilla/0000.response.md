Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

3. It then checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

4. If not all elements are the same, it initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp` in the array.

5. It then iterates over the array. If the current element is the same as `tmp`, it increments the counter. If the current element is different, it updates the answer `ans` with the minimum of the current answer and the counter, and resets the counter.

6. After iterating over the entire array, it updates the answer one last time with the minimum of the current answer and the counter.

7. Finally, it prints the answer.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of the first element in the array, but it's not used correctly in the program. The program should be checking for consecutive occurrences of the same element, not just the first element. This can be fixed by updating the value of `tmp` whenever a different element is encountered.

Correctness: **False**
