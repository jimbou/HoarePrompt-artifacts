Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first two values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the square of prime, factor is the (factors[prime] + 3)th value in the list rest, and the value of factor * prime has been yielded.**

In this output state, the value of `prime_to_i` has been updated to be the square of `prime`, and the value of `factor * prime` has been yielded. All other variables remain unchanged.
