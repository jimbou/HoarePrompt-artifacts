The only variable in the loop head is the variable _ and factors[prime], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable factors[prime]. If factors[prime] is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, factors[prime] is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, factors[prime] must be at least 2.
State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first value removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, factor is the second value in the list rest, prime_to_i is the product of the original prime_to_i, prime, and prime, and factors[prime] is at least 2, and the value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded.**
