Postcondition: ***k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers. If k is equal to the number of elements in the list primes, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, factors[prime] has been incremented by the length of rest, rest is an empty list, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the product of the last value in the original list rest and the (factors[prime] + length of rest)th power of the (k + 1)th prime number, factor is the last value in the original list rest, and the value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded.***
