This function takes a positive integer `n` greater than 1 as input and returns a generator that yields all possible values produced by the `generate(0)` function. The function first calculates the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, storing them in a dictionary called `factors`. It then creates a list of all prime factors of `n` and assigns each value produced by `generate(0)` to a variable `factor`, yielding and returning each value. The function's final state is that it has yielded and returned all possible values produced by `generate(0)`, with the input `n` remaining unchanged.
