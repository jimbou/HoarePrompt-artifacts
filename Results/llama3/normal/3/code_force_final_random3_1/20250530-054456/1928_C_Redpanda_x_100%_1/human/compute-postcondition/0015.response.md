To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `factors[prime]`. The loop will execute if `factors[prime]` is at least 0, because the range function in Python can accept 0 as an argument and will not throw an error.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `factors` is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, `rest` is a list of values generated by `generate(k + 1)` with the first two values removed, `prime` is the `(k + 1)`th prime number in the list `primes`, `factor` is the `(factors[prime] + 2)`th value in the list `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1, and `factors[prime]` is at least 0**
