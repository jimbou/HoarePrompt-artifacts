Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first two values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the cube of prime, factor is the (factors[prime] + 3)th value in the list rest, and the value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded.**

The code yields the product of `factor` and `prime_to_i`, then updates `prime_to_i` by multiplying it by `prime`. The value of `prime_to_i` changes from the square of `prime` to the cube of `prime`. All other variables remain unchanged.
