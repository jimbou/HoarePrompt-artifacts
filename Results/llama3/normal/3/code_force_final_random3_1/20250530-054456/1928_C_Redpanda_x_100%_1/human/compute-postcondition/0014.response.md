Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `factors` is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, `rest` is a list of values generated by `generate(k + 1)` with the first two values removed, `prime` is the `(k + 1)`th prime number in the list `primes`, `factor` is the `(factors[prime] + 2)`th value in the list `rest`, and `prime_to_i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `prime_to_i` has been reset to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `factor * prime_to_i` is no longer yielded, as the value of `prime_to_i` has been reset.
