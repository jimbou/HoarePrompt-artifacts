Functionality: **Generates a sequence of numbers by iteratively multiplying prime numbers with their corresponding factors, yielding each product. If the input index k equals the number of prime numbers, it yields 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates the sequence for the next prime number, increments the factor of the current prime number, and yields the products of the current prime number raised to its incremented factor and each number in the recursive sequence.**
