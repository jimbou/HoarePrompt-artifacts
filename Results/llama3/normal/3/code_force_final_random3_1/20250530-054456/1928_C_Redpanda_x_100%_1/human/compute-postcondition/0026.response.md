The only object in the loop head is variable _, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than factors[prime] + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is the product of the (factors[prime] + 3)th value in the list rest and 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ must be the product of the (factors[prime] + 4)th value in the list rest and 1.
State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first three values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the (factors[prime] + 4)th value in the list rest multiplied by the (k + 1)th prime number, factor is the (factors[prime] + 4)th value in the list rest, _ is the product of the (factors[prime] + 4)th value in the list rest and 1.**
