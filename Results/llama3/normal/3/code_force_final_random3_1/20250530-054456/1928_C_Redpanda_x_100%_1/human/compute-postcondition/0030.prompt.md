Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first three values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is 1, factor is the (factors[prime] + 3)th value in the list rest
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
    yield factor * prime_to_i
    prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first three values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the (factors[prime] + 3)th value in the list rest multiplied by the (k + 1)th prime number, factor is the (factors[prime] + 3)th value in the list rest, _ is the product of the (factors[prime] + 3)th value in the list rest and 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first three values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the product of the (factors[prime] + 4)th value in the list rest and the square of the (k + 1)th prime number, factor is the (factors[prime] + 4)th value in the list rest, _ is the product of the (factors[prime] + 4)th value in the list rest and 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, with factors[prime] incremented by 1, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first three values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the product of the (factors[prime] + 5)th value in the list rest, the square of the (k + 1)th prime number, and the (k + 1)th prime number, factor is the (factors[prime] + 5)th value in the list rest, _ is the product of the (factors[prime] + 5)th value in the list rest and 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
