The only variable in the loop head is `factor` and `rest`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rest`. If the list has at least 2 values the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first value removed, factor is the (factors[prime] + 1)th value in the list rest. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 values and the factor is the (factors[prime] + 2)th value in the list rest.
State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first two values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, factor is the (factors[prime] + 2)th value in the list rest, prime_to_i is the product of the original prime_to_i and prime to the power of (factors[prime] + 1), and the value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded.**
