Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first value removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, factor is the second value in the list rest, prime_to_i is the product of the original prime_to_i, prime, and prime, and factors[prime] is at least 1, and the value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded.**

In this output state, the value of `prime_to_i` has been updated to be the product of its original value, `prime`, and `prime` again. The value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, but this does not affect the state of any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
