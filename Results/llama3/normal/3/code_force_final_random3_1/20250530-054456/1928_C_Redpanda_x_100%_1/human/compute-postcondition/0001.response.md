Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers. The current value of k is equal to the number of elements in the list primes. The value 1 has been yielded.**

In this output state, the values of k, primes, and factors remain unchanged. The code only yields the value 1, which means it produces a value that can be retrieved by the caller, but it does not modify any of the existing variables. The relationship between k and the number of elements in primes also remains the same.
