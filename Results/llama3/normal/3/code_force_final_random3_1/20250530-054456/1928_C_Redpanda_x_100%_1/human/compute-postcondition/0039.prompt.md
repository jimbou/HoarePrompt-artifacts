Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a multiple of the product of all prime factors of `n`, `factors` is a dictionary with keys as all prime factors of `n` and values as their respective powers. If `nn` is greater than 1, the value of `factors[nn]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `factors`. `primes` is a list of all prime factors of `n`.
Code of the loop:
for factor in generate(0):
    yield factor


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a multiple of the product of all prime factors of `n`, `factors` is a dictionary with keys as all prime factors of `n` and values as their respective powers, `primes` is a list of all prime factors of `n`, `factor` is assigned a value produced by `generate(0)`, `generate(0)` produces at least one value, and the value of `factor` has been yielded.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a multiple of the product of all prime factors of `n`, `factors` is a dictionary with keys as all prime factors of `n` and values as their respective powers, `primes` is a list of all prime factors of `n`, `factor` is assigned a value produced by `generate(0)`, `generate(0)` produces at least two values, the value of `factor` has been yielded and returned

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a multiple of the product of all prime factors of `n`, `factors` is a dictionary with keys as all prime factors of `n` and values as their respective powers, `primes` is a list of all prime factors of `n`, `generate(0)` produces at least three values, the value of `factor` has been yielded and returned, and the function has yielded the value of `factor`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
