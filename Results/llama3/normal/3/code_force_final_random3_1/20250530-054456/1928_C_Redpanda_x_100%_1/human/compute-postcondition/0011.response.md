Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first value removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, factor is the second value in the list rest, prime_to_i is the product of the original prime_to_i, prime, and prime, and factors[prime] is at least 2, and the value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded, and prime_to_i has been multiplied by prime.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for prime_to_i, which has been multiplied by prime. The value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded, but this does not affect the state of the variables.
