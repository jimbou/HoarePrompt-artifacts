Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. The program is trying to generate all possible factors of the number n, but it does not correctly use these factors to find the number of different k.

The problem description requires the program to find the number of different k such that the settling pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. It only generates all possible factors of the number n, but it does not use these factors to find the number of different k.

For example, if the input is n = 10 and x = 2, the program should output 4, because k = 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable. However, the program does not correctly output this result.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should use the factors of the number n to find the number of different k. It should iterate over all possible factors of n, and for each factor, it should check if the settling pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions. If it does, it should increment the count of different k.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - x) % (2 * k - 2) == 0 and (n - x) // (2 * k - 2) >= 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This implementation correctly finds the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. It iterates over all possible factors of n, and for each factor, it checks if the settling pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions. If it does, it increments the count of different k.
