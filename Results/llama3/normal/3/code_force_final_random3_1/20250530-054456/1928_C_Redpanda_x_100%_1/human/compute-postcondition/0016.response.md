Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, rest is a list of values generated by generate(k + 1) with the first two values removed, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, factor is the (factors[prime] + 2)th value in the list rest, prime_to_i is prime, and factors[prime] is at least 0**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line yields the product of `factor` and `prime_to_i`, but does not modify any variables. The second line multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`, updating its value to `prime`. The values of `k`, `primes`, `factors`, `rest`, `prime`, and `factor` remain unchanged. The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to `prime`.
