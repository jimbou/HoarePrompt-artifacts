You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers.
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, with factors[prime] incremented by the length of rest, rest is an empty list, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the product of the last value in the original list rest and the (factors[prime] + length of rest)th power of the (k + 1)th prime number, factor is the last value in the original list rest, and the value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded.
    #State: *k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers. If k is equal to the number of elements in the list primes, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, factors[prime] has been incremented by the length of rest, rest is an empty list, prime is the (k + 1)th prime number in the list primes, prime_to_i is the product of the last value in the original list rest and the (factors[prime] + length of rest)th power of the (k + 1)th prime number, factor is the last value in the original list rest, and the value of factor * prime_to_i has been yielded.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
