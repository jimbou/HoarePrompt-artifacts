Output State: **nodes is an empty dictionary, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True**.

The code snippet provided does not modify the initial state of the variables `nodes` and `start`. However, it introduces new variables `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`. The `map` function is used to assign integer values to `n` and `t` from the input. The `edges` list is initialized as empty, and the `empty` variable is set to `True`. The `defaultdict` function is used to create a new empty dictionary `nodes`, which replaces the original dictionary. As a result, the key `start` is no longer present in the `nodes` dictionary.
