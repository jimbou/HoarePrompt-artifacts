This function determines the winner of a game based on the parity of moves in a graph. It takes a graph represented as a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, and a starting node as input. The function identifies the leaves of the graph (nodes with only one neighbor) and then calls another function, func_1, to determine the moves. If any of the moves are odd, it prints 'Ron', otherwise it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input graph or nodes.
