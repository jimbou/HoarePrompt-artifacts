Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with three keys, u, v, and the original keys, each containing a list with two elements, the other key and the original key, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer greater than 2, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 1, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer**

In this output state, the dictionary nodes now has three keys: u, v, and the original keys. Each key contains a list with two elements: the other key and the original key. The values of start, n, t, edges, empty, and i remain unchanged. The variables u and v are now integers, assigned from the input. Stdin is empty, as it was before the code execution.
