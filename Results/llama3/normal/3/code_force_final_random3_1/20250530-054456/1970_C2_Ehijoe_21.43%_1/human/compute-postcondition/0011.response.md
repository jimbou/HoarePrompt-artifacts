Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with at least 1 key, key is the first key in the dictionary, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n-2, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer, leaves is a deque containing the first key in the dictionary. The current value of the length of the list of nodes[key] is 1.**
