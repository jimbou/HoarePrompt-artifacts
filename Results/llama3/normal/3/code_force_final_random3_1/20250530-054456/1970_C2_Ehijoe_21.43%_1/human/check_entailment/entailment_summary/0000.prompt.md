Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Example

Input

    5 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 3
    
    3 4
    
    3 5
    
    1

Output

    Ron

# Functions with Execution Summary:
from functools import reduce
import math
from collections import deque, defaultdict

t = 1
for i in range(t):
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(nodes, start, parent=None):
    if len(nodes[start]) == 1 and nodes[start][0] == parent:
        return [0]
    distances = []
    for node in nodes[start]:
        if node != parent:
            distances.extend([1 + dist for dist in func_1(nodes, node, start)])
    return distances
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function calculates the distances from a given node to all other nodes in a tree structure, excluding the parent node. It takes a tree structure represented as a list of lists of integers, a start node, and an optional parent node as input. If the start node has only one child and that child is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single integer, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances from the start node to all other nodes in the tree, excluding the parent node, and returns a list of these distances, where each distance is incremented by 1.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    (n, t) = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
        nodes[u].append(v)
        nodes[v].append(u)
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves]):
        print('Ron')
    else:
        print('Hermione')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function determines the winner of a game based on the parity of moves in a graph. It takes a graph represented as a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, and a starting node as input. The function identifies the leaves of the graph (nodes with only one neighbor) and then calls another function, func_1, to determine the moves. If any of the moves are odd, it prints 'Ron', otherwise it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input graph or nodes.
