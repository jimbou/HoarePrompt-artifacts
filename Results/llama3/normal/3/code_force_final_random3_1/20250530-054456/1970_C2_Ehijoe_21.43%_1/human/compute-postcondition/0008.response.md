Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with n keys, each containing a list with n-1 elements, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n-2, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer, leaves is an empty deque**

The code creates an empty deque called `leaves`. The other variables remain unchanged.
