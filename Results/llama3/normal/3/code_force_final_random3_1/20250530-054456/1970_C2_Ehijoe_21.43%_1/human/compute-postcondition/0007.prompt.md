Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: nodes is an empty dictionary, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    nodes[u].append(v)
    nodes[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: nodes is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with one element, the other key, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 0, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: nodes is a dictionary with three keys, u, v, and the original keys, each containing a list with two elements, the other key and the original key, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer greater than 2, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 1, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: nodes is a dictionary with three keys, u, v, and the original keys, each containing a list with three elements, the other key, the original key, and the new key, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer greater than 3, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 2, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
