To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range function will generate at least one value (0) when `n` is 1, but the loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or less.

State: **nodes is an empty dictionary, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 0**
