Postcondition: ***nodes is a dictionary with n keys, key is the nth key in the dictionary, start is an integer equal to the input value, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 2n-2, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer, moves is a value returned by func_1(nodes, start), leaves is a deque containing all keys in the dictionary where the length of the list of nodes[key] is 1 if such keys exist, otherwise leaves is an empty deque. If the current value of moves contains at least one odd number, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in moves are even, and 'Hermione' is printed.***
