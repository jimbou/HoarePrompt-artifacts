Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, key is the second key in the dictionary, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n-1, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer, leaves is a deque containing the second key in the dictionary.**

In natural language, the output state is: The dictionary "nodes" still has at least 2 keys, and "key" is still the second key in the dictionary. The variable "start" is still an integer that is not a key in "nodes". The variables "n" and "t" are still integers. The list "edges" is still empty, and the boolean "empty" is still True. The variable "i" is still equal to "n-1". There is still no input in stdin. The variables "u" and "v" are still integers. The deque "leaves" now contains the second key in the dictionary, which is "key".
