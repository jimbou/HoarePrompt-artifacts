Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes. The function `func_1` is recursive and calculates the distances by exploring all possible paths from the starting node. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the game is played on a tree, and the distances should be calculated based on the shortest path between nodes.

For example, consider a tree with 5 nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The edges are (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), and (3, 5). If the starting node is 1, the program will calculate the distances as follows: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]. However, the correct distances should be [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] because the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is 1 -> 3 -> 5, which has a length of 2.

As a result, the program will incorrectly determine the winner of the game in some cases. For instance, if the starting node is 1, the program will print "Hermione" because all distances are even, but the correct answer is "Ron" because there is a path of odd length (1 -> 3 -> 5) that Ron can take to win the game.
