To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **nodes is a dictionary with three keys, u, v, and the original keys, each containing a list with two elements, the other key and the original key, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer greater than 3, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 2, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer**
