State: **nodes is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, key is the third key in the dictionary, start is an integer such that start is not a key in nodes, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n, stdin contains no input, u is an integer, v is an integer. If the length of the list of nodes[key] is 1, then leaves is a deque containing the third key in the dictionary. Otherwise, leaves remains an empty deque.**
