This function calculates the distances from a given node to all other nodes in a tree structure, excluding the parent node. It takes a tree structure represented as a list of lists of integers, a start node, and an optional parent node as input. If the start node has only one child and that child is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single integer, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances from the start node to all other nodes in the tree, excluding the parent node, and returns a list of these distances, where each distance is incremented by 1.
