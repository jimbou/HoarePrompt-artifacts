The only variable in the loop head is variable j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n // 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0, n is an even integer and at least 2. For the loop to execute again j must be increased by 1 so j is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be at least 4.
