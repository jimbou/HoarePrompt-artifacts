Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t integers n, s is the string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is even and at least 52, 'YES' is being printed, and `ans` is the string of all uppercase English letters repeated twice. If `n` is odd and at least 51, 'YES' is being printed, and `ans` is 'AAA' followed by two 'B's, then two 'C's, then two 'D's, and so on until two 'Y's, and `ans` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` contains t-2 integers, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer. If `n` is 1, the string "NO" is being printed. If `n` is even and at least 4, `ans` is a string containing the first `n//2` characters of `s` repeated twice, `x` is `n//2`, and `j` is `n//2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is 'AAAABCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOO', `x` is 14, and `j` is 13, and 'YES' is printed, and the value of `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains t-3 integers. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is even, `ans` is 'AA' followed by (n-2) uppercase English letters, `x` is `n` // 2. If `n` is odd and greater than 3, `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDDEEEFFFGGGHHHIIIJJJKKKLLLMMMNNNOOOPPPQQQRRRSSSTTTUUUVVVWWWXXXYYYZZZ', `x` is 26, `j` is 12, 'YES' is printed, and `ans` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
