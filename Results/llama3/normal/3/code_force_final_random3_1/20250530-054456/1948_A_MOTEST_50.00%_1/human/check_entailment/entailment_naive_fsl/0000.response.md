Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description. It checks if the input number `n` is 1, in which case it prints "NO" as there is no suitable string with exactly one special character. For all other cases, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating uppercase Latin letters.

The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly. For even `n`, it simply repeats each letter twice to create `n/2` pairs of special characters. For odd `n`, it starts with "AAA" to create three special characters and then repeats each letter twice to create the remaining `(n-3)/2` pairs of special characters.

The program also handles the case where `n` is greater than 50, as it only uses a maximum of 200 characters in the constructed string, which is within the allowed limit.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
