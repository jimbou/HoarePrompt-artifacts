The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 6.
