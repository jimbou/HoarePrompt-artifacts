Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is `t`. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even and at least 52, 'YES' is being printed, and `ans` is the string of all uppercase English letters repeated twice. If `n` is odd and at least 51, 'YES' is being printed, and `ans` is 'AAA' followed by two 'B's, then two 'C's, then two 'D's, and so on until two 'Y's, and `ans` is being printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the input `stdin` is empty. The string `s` remains unchanged as the string of all uppercase English letters. The variable `t` is still an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, but its value has been decremented by the number of iterations. The variable `i` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The output state also describes the possible values of `ans` and the printed output based on the value of `n`.
