Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains t-3 integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 integers because one integer has been read and assigned to `n`.
