Output State: **ans is the string of all uppercase English letters repeated twice, x is 26, s is the string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, i is 0, n is an even integer and at least 52, j is 25, stdin contains t-25 integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `ans` will contain all uppercase English letters repeated twice, the index `x` will be 26, the string `s` will remain unchanged, the integer `t` will still be between 1 and 50 inclusive, the integer `i` will remain 0, the integer `n` will be an even integer and at least 52, the loop counter `j` will be 25, and the standard input `stdin` will contain `t-25` integers.
