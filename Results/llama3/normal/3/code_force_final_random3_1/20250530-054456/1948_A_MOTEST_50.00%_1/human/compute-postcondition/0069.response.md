Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, i is 2, n is an integer, ans is 'AA' followed by (n-2) uppercase English letters, x is n // 2, stdin contains t-3 integers.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string s remains unchanged, the integer t remains unchanged, the integer i remains unchanged, the integer n remains unchanged, the string ans is 'AA' followed by (n-2) uppercase English letters, the integer x is n // 2, and the stdin contains t-3 integers.
