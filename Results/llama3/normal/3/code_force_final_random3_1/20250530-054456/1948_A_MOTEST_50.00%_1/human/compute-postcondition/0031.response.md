The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1**
