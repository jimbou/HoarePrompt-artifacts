The only variables in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n // 2` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is even and not equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is even but we need to adjust it to be at least 2 and `j` is now 0.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer and at least 2, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `j` is 0**
