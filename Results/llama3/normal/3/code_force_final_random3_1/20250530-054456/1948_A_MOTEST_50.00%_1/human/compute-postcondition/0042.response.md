Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, i is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 4, ans is a string containing the first n//2 characters of s repeated twice, x is n//2, stdin contains t-2 integers, j is n//2 - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the string s remains unchanged, the integer t remains unchanged, the integer i remains unchanged, the integer n remains unchanged, the string ans contains the first n//2 characters of s repeated twice, the integer x is equal to n//2, the stdin contains t-2 integers, and the integer j is equal to n//2 - 1.
