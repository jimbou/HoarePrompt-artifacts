The function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 50) and the following t inputs are integers n (1 <= n <= 50). For each n, if n is 1, it prints 'NO'. If n is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of all uppercase English letters repeated twice. If n is odd, it prints 'YES' followed by a string starting with 'AAA' and then two consecutive uppercase English letters from 'B' to 'Y'. After processing all inputs, stdin is left empty.
