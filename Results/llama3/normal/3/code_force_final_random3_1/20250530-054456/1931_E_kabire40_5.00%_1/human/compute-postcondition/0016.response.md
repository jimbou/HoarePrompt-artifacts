Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 3 values, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the third value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the third value in the list plus the third value in the list, y is 0, x is the third value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the third value in the list converted to an integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The stdin remains empty, list_len and max_power are still integers, operational_list is still a list with at least 3 values, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the third value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the third value in the list plus the third value in the list, y is still 0, x is still the third value in the list, and x_rev is still the reverse of the third value in the list converted to an integer.
