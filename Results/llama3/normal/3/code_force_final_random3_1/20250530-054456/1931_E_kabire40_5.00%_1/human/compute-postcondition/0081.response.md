Output: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val, y is 1, x is the last index of rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list, 'Sasha' is printed. The current value of the result of 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is less than the integer value of rev_res.**
