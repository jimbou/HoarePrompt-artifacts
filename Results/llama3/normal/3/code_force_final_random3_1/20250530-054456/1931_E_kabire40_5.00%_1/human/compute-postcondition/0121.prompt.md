Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains no input, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val, y is 2, x is the last string in the original operational_list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `list_len`, `max_power` are integers, `operational_list` is an empty list, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reverse of all the strings in the original `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 1 element, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original `operational_list` that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in `rev_val` plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in `rev_val`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index 0 in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` also includes the reverse of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`. `y` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is 0. If `x` is odd, `x` is the last string in the original `operational_list` and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *list_len, max_power are integers, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val. If x is even, x is 1 and rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index 0 in rev_val. If x is odd, x is the last string in the original operational_list and x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list and rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index 1 in rev_val. y is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *list_len, max_power are integers, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 3 elements, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val. If x is even, x is 2 and rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index 0 in rev_val. If x is odd, x is the second last string in the original operational_list and x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the second last string in the original operational_list and rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index 1 in rev_val. If x is even, rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. Otherwise, rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. y is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
