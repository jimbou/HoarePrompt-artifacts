Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 0, x is the last index of rev_val, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer. If the current value of rev_res is greater than 10 raised to the power of max_power, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, if 10 to the power of max_power is larger than or equal to the integer value of rev_res, 'Anna' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val, y is 1, x is the last index of rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. If the current value of the result of 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is less than the integer value of rev_res, then 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed and 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is larger than or equal to the integer value of rev_res.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: list_len and max_power are integers, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least len(rev_val) elements, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val. If x is even, x is len(rev_val) - 1 and rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index 0 in rev_val. If x is odd, x is the last string in the original operational_list and x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list and rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index len(rev_val) - 1 in rev_val. If x is even, rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. Otherwise, rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. y is len(rev_val). If the current value of rev_res is greater than 10 to the power of max_power, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is greater than or equal to the integer value of rev_res and 'Anna' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
