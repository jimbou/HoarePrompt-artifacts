Postcondition: ***list_len, max_power are integers, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 3 elements, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val. If x is even, x is 2 and rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index 0 in rev_val. If x is odd, x is the second last string in the original operational_list and x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the second last string in the original operational_list and rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index 1 in rev_val. If x is even, rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. Otherwise, rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. y is 3***
