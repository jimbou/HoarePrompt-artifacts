The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is less than the integer value of the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is 1, the input is an integer. For the loop to execute again y must be increased by 1 so y is 2 and for the loop to execute again the input must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val, y is 2, x is the last index of rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. If the current value of the result of 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is less than the integer value of rev_res, then 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed and 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is larger than or equal to the integer value of rev_res.**
