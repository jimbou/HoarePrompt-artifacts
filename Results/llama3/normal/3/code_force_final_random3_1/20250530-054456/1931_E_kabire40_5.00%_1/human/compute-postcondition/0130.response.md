Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines the winner of a game based on the processed data. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m, and the second line contains n integers. The function processes these integers, reversing some of them, and concatenates them into a string. It then compares the value of this string to 10 raised to the power of m. If the string value is greater, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. After processing all test cases, the function leaves stdin empty and the input variables in a modified state.**
