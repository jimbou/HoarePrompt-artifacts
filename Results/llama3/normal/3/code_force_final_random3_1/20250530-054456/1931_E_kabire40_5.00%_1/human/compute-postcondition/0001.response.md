The code reads two lines of input from stdin. The first line is split into two values: `list_len` and `max_power`. The second line is split into a list of values, which is assigned to `operational_list`. The variables `rev_val` and `rev_res` are initialized as an empty list and an empty string, respectively, but are not modified by the code. The variable `y` is initialized as 0, but is not modified by the code.

Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is an empty string, y is 0**
