Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 3 values, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the third value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the third value in the list, y is 0, x is the third value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the third value in the list converted to an integer.**

The code only reassigns the value of x_rev. The value of x_rev is the reverse of the third value in the list converted to an integer. The other variables are not affected. The value of x_rev is updated to be the reverse of the third value in the list converted to an integer.
