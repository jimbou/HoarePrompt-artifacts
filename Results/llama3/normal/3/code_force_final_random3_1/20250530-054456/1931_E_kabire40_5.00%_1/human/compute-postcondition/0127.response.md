Output: **list_len, max_power are integers, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least len(rev_val) elements, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val. If x is even, x is len(rev_val) - 1 and rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index 0 in rev_val. If x is odd, x is the last string in the original operational_list and x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list and rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index len(rev_val) - 1 in rev_val. If x is even, rev_res also includes the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. Otherwise, rev_res also includes the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. y is len(rev_val). Additionally, 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is greater than or equal to the integer value of rev_res. The string 'Anna' is being printed.**
