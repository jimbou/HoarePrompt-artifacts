Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains no input, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original `operational_list` that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in `rev_val` plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in `rev_val` plus the first string in the `operational_list` if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list` is equal to the length of the first string in the `operational_list`, `y` is 2, `x` is the first string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`.***
