Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is an empty string, y is 0
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 1 value, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the first value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the first value in the list, y is 0, x is the first value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the first value in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res contains the first value in the list. Otherwise, rev_val contains the reverse of the first value in operational_list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 2 values, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the second value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the second value in the list, y is 0, x is the second value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the second value in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res contains the second value in the list plus the second value in the list. Otherwise, rev_val contains the reverse of the second value in operational_list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 3 values, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the third value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the third value in the list, y is 0, x is the third value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the third value in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res contains the third value in the list plus the third value in the list. Otherwise, rev_val contains the reverse of the third value in operational_list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
