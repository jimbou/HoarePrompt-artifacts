Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 3 values, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the third value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the third value in the list, y is 0, x is the third value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the third value in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res contains the third value in the list plus the third value in the list. Otherwise, rev_val contains the reverse of the third value in operational_list.***
