The only variables in the loop head are variables  x and operational_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the operational_list.  If the list has at least 1 value the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is an empty string, y is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 value and the x is the first value in the list.
State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 1 value, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is an empty string, y is 0, x is the first value in the list**
