Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 2 values, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the second value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the second value in the list plus the second value in the list, y is 0, x is the second value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the second value in the list converted to an integer.**

In this output state, the only variable that has been changed is rev_res. Initially, rev_res was either empty or contained the second value in the list. After the code was executed, rev_res is either empty or contains the second value in the list plus the second value in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
