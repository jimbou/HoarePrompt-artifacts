Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `x` is the second string in the list, `y` is 1, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the second string in the list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the second string in the list, and `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the second string in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated to include the second string in the list (`x`). The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the length of the string representation of `x_rev` and the length of `x` still holds, and the value of `rev_val` depends on this condition.
