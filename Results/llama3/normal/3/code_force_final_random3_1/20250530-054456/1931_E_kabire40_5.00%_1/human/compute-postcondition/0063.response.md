Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of strings that are the reverse of the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 1, x is the last string in the original operational_list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed.**

The code sorts the list `rev_val` in ascending order, which contains the reverse of the strings in the original `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed. The other variables remain unchanged.
