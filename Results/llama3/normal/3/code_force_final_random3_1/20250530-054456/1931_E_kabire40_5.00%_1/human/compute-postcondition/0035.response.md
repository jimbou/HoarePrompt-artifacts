Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 0, x is the last index of rev_val, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the stdin remains empty, list_len and max_power remain integers, operational_list remains empty, rev_val becomes empty as all its elements have been processed, rev_res contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y remains 0, x is now the last index of rev_val, and x_rev remains the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer.
