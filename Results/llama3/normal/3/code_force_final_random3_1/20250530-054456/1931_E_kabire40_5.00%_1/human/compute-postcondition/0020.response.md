Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of values that are the reverse of the values in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 0, x is the last value in the original operational_list, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `rev_val` is now sorted in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties.
