To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the loop head variables, which are `y` and the input value that `y` is ranging over.

Given the loop head `for y in range(int(input())):`, we know that `y` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than the integer value obtained from the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be incremented by 1. The input value, which is the upper limit of the range, must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 1, x is the last index of rev_val, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer. If the current value of rev_res is greater than 10 raised to the power of max_power, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, if 10 to the power of max_power is larger than or equal to the integer value of rev_res, 'Anna' is printed.**
