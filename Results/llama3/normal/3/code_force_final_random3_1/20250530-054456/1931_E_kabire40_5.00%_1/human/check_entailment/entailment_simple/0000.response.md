Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the optimal play. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers in the list (n) and the parameter determining when Sasha wins (m).
3. It then reads the list of integers and for each integer, it checks if the reversed integer has the same length as the original integer. If it does, it appends the original integer to the result string (rev_res). If it doesn't, it appends the reversed integer to the list (rev_val).
4. It then sorts the list (rev_val) in ascending order.
5. It then iterates over the sorted list (rev_val) and for each integer, it checks if the index is even or odd. If the index is even, it appends the integer value of the reversed integer to the result string (rev_res). If the index is odd, it appends the reversed integer to the result string (rev_res).
6. Finally, it checks if the result string (rev_res) is greater than 10 raised to the power of m. If it is, it prints "Sasha", otherwise it prints "Anna".

The program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the optimal play. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
