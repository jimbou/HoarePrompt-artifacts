Output State: **rev_res is the string that is the reverse of the string at index x of rev_val, x is 2, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of strings that are the reverse of the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 3 elements, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated to be the reverse of the string at index x of rev_val. The value of x, y, list_len, max_power, operational_list, rev_val, and x_rev remain unchanged. Stdin is still empty.
