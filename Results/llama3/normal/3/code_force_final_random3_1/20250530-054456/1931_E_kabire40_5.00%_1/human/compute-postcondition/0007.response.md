Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 1 value, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the first value in operational_list, rev_res is an empty string, y is 0, x is the first value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the first value in the list converted to an integer, and the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of x.**

In natural language, the output state is: The stdin remains empty, the list_len and max_power variables retain their integer values, the operational_list still contains at least one value, the rev_val list now contains the reverse of the first value in operational_list, the rev_res string remains empty, the y variable stays at 0, the x variable is still the first value in the list, the x_rev variable is still the reverse of the first value in the list converted to an integer, and the length of the string representation of x_rev is still not equal to the length of x.
