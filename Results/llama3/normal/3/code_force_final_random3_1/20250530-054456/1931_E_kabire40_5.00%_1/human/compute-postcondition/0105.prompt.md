Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains no input, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in rev_val, y is 2, x is the last index of rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains no input, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original `operational_list` that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in `rev_val` plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in `rev_val` plus the first string in the `operational_list` if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list` is equal to the length of the first string in the `operational_list`, `y` is 2, `x` is the first string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` contains no input, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original `operational_list` that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in `rev_val` plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in `rev_val` plus the first string in the `operational_list` if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list` is equal to the length of the first string in the `operational_list`, `y` is 2, `x` is the second string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the second string in the `operational_list` which is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of the reverse of the second string in the `operational_list` is equal to the length of the second string in the `operational_list`, then `rev_res` also includes the second string in the `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` includes the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list` and the reverse of the second string in the `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` contains no input, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original `operational_list` that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in `rev_val` plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in `rev_val` plus the first string in the `operational_list` if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list` is equal to the length of the first string in the `operational_list`, `y` is 2, `x` is the third string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the third string in the `operational_list` which is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of the reverse of the third string in the `operational_list` is equal to the length of the third string in the `operational_list`, then `rev_res` also includes the third string in the `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` includes the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`, the reverse of the second string in the `operational_list` and the reverse of the third string in the `operational_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
