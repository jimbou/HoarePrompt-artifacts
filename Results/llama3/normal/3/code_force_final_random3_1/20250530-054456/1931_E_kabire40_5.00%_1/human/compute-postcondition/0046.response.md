Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, x is the first string in the list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string, y is 1, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `x_rev` has been updated to the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list `operational_list`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty, and either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' has been printed.
