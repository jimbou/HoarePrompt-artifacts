Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of values that are the reverse of the values in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 1 value, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 0, x is an integer, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer. If x is even, the value of the element at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res. If x is odd, the reverse of the value at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res.***
