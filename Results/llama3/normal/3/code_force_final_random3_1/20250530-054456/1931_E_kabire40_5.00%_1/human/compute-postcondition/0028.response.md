Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of values that are the reverse of the values in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 1 value, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed and the value of rev_val at index x, y is 0, x is an integer incremented by 1, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer**

In this output state, the code has modified the value of rev_res by appending the value of rev_val at index x to it. The value of x has also been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
