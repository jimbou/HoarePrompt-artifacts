Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 2 values, rev_val is either empty or contains the reverse of the second value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the second value in the list, y is 0, x is the second value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the second value in the list converted to an integer.**

The value of x_rev has been updated to the reverse of the second value in the list converted to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, so rev_res contains the second value in the list. Otherwise, rev_val contains the reverse of the second value in operational_list.
