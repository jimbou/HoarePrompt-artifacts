Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of values that must have at least 2 values, rev_val contains the reverse of the second value in operational_list, rev_res is either empty or contains the second value in the list, y is 0, x is the second value in the list, x_rev is the reverse of the second value in the list converted to an integer.**

In this output state, the value of rev_val has been updated to include the reverse of the second value in operational_list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty, and the values of list_len, max_power, operational_list, rev_res, y, x, and x_rev are the same as in the initial state.
