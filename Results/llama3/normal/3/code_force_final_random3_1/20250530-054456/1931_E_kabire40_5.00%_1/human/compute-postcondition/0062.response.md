Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a list of strings that are the reverse of the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 1, x is the last string in the original operational_list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the operational_list will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The rev_val list will contain the reverse of the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed. The rev_res string will be the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed. The value of x will be the last string in the original operational_list, and x_rev will be the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. The values of stdin, list_len, max_power, y, and the printed name ('Sasha' or 'Anna') remain unchanged.
