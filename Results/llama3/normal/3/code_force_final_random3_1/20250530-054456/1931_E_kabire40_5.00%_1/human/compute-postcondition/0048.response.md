Output State: **stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, x is the first string in the list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is the string that is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the first string in the list, y is 1, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed. The current value of x_rev has the same number of digits as the current value of x.**

In natural language, the output state is: The stdin remains empty, the list_len and max_power remain integers, the operational_list remains a list of strings with at least one string, x remains the first string in the list, rev_val remains an empty list, y remains 1, x_rev remains the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list, and either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed. The only change is that rev_res is now the concatenation of its original value and the first string in the list. The number of digits in x_rev remains the same as the number of digits in x.
