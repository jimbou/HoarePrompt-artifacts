Output State: **`stdin` contains no input, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original `operational_list` that have the same length when reversed plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the strings at even indices in `rev_val` plus the reverse of the strings at odd indices in `rev_val`, `y` is 2, `x` is the first string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`.**

In this output state, the value of `x_rev` has been updated to be the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the `operational_list`, which was previously the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original `operational_list`. All other variables remain unchanged.
