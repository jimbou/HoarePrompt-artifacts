Output State: **list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of values that are the reverse of the values in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 2 values, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed and the value of rev_val at index x, y is 0, x is an integer incremented by 2, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated to include the value of `rev_val` at index `x`. The value of `x` has also been incremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
