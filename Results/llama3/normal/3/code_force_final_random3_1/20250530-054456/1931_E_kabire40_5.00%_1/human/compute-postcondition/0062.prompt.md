Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string, y is 1, x is -1, x_rev is 0, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, x is the first string in the list, y is 1, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the first string in the list, and rev_val is an empty list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the first string in the list, and rev_res remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, x is the second string in the list, y is 1, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the second string in the list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the second string in the list, and rev_val is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the second string in the list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the second string in the list, and rev_res remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, x is the third string in the list, y is 1, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the third string in the list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the third string in the list, and rev_val is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the third string in the list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the third string in the list, and rev_res remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
