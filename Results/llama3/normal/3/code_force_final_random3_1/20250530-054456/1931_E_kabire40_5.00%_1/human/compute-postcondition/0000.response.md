The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y and the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains an integer t that is greater than 0 and y is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains an integer t that is greater than 0, y is 0**
