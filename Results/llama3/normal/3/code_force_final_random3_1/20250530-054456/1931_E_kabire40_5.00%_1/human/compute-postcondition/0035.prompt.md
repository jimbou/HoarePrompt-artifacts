Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of values that are the reverse of the values in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 0, x is the last value in the original operational_list, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of values that are the reverse of the values in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 1 value, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 0, x is an integer, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer. If x is even, the value of the element at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res. If x is odd, the reverse of the value at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of values that are the reverse of the values in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 1 value, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed. If x is even, the value of rev_val at index x is added to rev_res. If x is odd, the reverse of the value at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res. y is 0, x is an integer incremented by 1, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of values that are the reverse of the values in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 2 values, rev_res is a string that contains all the values from the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed. If x is even, the value of rev_val at index x is added to rev_res. If x is odd, the reverse of the value at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res. y is 0, x is an integer incremented by 2, x_rev is the reverse of the last value in the original operational_list converted to an integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
