Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of strings that are the reverse of the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed, y is 1, x is 0, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list, either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed. If x is even, x is 0 and rev_res is the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. If x is odd, rev_res is the concatenation of all the strings in the original operational_list that have the same length when reversed plus the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val.***
