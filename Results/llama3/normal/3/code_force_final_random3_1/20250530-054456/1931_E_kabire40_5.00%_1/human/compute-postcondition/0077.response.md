Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list of strings that are the reverse of the strings in the original operational_list that do not have the same length when reversed and must have at least 3 elements, x is 2, y is 1, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. If x is even, rev_res is the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val. If x is odd, rev_res is the string that is the reverse of the string at index x of rev_val.***
