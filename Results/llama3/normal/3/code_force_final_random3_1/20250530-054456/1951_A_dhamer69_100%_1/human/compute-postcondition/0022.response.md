Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of size `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `count_1` is even, and either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2, and 'YES' is being printed**
