Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 998, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If n is 2, then if the binary string s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the number of '1's in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the number of '1's in s is even, then if s contains exactly one '11' and the number of '1's equals 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is decreased by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same. The value of t is now between 0 and 998, and the rest of the conditions and variables are unchanged.
