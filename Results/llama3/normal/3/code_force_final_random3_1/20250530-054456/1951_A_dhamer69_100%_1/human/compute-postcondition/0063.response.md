Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains no test cases. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variable t has reached 0. The loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and there are no more test cases left in stdin. The values of n and s are still as defined in the initial state, but they are no longer relevant since the loop has finished executing. The output state still describes the conditions under which 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, but these conditions are now moot since the loop has completed its execution.
