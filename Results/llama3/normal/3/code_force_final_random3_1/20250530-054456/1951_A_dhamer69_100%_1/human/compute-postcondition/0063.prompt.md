Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one input: a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 999, n is an integer, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 998, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If n is 2, then if the binary string s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the number of '1's in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the number of '1's in s is even, then if s contains exactly one '11' and the number of '1's equals 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 997, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if s contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and count_1 equals 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
