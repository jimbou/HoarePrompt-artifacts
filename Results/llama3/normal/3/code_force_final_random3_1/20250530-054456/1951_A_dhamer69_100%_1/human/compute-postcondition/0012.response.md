Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of size `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is assigned the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the binary string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before since one test case has been processed.
