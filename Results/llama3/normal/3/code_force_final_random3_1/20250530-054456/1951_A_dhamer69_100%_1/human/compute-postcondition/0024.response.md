Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of size `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `count_1` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `count_1` is even, then if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
