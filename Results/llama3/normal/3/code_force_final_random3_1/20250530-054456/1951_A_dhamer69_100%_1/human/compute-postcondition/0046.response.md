Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 998, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the first input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer equal to the first input, its value is updated to the new input value. The second line assigns the binary string value of the second input to `s`. Since `s` was previously a binary string of size `n`, its value is updated to the new binary string of size `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Stdin now contains multiple test cases - 2, as two inputs have been consumed.
