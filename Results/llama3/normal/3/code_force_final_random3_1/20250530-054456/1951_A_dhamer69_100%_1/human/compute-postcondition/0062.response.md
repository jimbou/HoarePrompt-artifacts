Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 997, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if s contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and count_1 equals 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

The value of t is decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 997. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remain the same.
