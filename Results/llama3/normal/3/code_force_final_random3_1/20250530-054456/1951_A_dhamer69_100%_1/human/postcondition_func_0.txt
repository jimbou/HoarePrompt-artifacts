This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a binary string s of size n. It then checks the string s based on its length n and the count of '1's in the string. If n is 2, it prints 'YES' if the string is '00', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If n is not 2, it prints 'NO' if the count of '1's is odd, or if the string contains exactly one '11' and the count of '1's is 2. In all other cases, it prints 'YES'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
