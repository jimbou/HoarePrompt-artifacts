Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a binary string of size `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), `count_1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `count_1` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `count_1` is even, then if `s` contains exactly one '11' and `count_1` equals 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
