The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one input: a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50)**
