Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a binary string of size `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), `count_1` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `s`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is determined by the number of '1's in the binary string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains one less test case.
