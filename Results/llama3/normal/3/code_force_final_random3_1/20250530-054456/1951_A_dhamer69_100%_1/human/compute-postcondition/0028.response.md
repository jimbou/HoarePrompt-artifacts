Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer equal to the first input, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the first input from stdin. The value of `s` is updated to a binary string of size `n`, which is the second input from stdin. Stdin now contains multiple test cases - 2, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
