Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of size `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and `count_1` is even. The current value of `count_1` is 2 and the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', and 'NO' is printed**
