Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one input: a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only contains one input: a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), because the first input (an integer) has been consumed by the `input()` function.
