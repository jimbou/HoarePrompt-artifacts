Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 999, n is an integer, s is a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is decreased by 1, and it can now be between 0 and 999. The values of n and s remain the same, and the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are still valid. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
