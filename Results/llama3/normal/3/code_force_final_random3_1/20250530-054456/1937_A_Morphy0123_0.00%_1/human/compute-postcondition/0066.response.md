Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is either 30 or 31, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `power` is equal to `n`, 2^31 is printed. Otherwise, `power` is 30 and the value of 2 raised to the power of 30 which is 1073741824 is being printed.***
