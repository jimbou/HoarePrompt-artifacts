The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`, where `power` is equal to `n`, which is an integer greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive).

Since `power` is equal to `n`, the expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** n`. The value of `2 ** n` is a power of 2, specifically 2 raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2^n (where n is an integer greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9)**
