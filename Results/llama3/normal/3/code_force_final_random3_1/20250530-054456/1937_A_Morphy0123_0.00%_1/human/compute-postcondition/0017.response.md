The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`, where `power` is equal to the current value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), the value of `power` is also within this range.

Output: **2 to the power of n (where n is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9)**
