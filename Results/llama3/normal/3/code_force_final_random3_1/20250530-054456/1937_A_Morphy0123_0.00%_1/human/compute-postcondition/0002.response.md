Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `n_cases` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), which is read from the first line of the input. The stdin now contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9), as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
