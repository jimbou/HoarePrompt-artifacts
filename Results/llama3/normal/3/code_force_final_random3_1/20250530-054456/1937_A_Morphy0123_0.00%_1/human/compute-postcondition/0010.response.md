The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive). `n` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2^2 (i.e., `n` is greater than 4). No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 2, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**
