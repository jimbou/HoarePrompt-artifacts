Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is either 31 or 32, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `power` equals `n`, 2 raised to the power of `power` is printed. Otherwise, `power` is 31 and the value of 2 raised to the power of 31 (2147483648) is printed.**
