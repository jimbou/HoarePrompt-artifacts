Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), either 2 raised to the power of 31 (2147483648) or 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` equals `n`) is printed.***
