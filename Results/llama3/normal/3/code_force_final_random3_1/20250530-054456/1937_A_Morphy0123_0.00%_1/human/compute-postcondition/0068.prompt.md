Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        while power < log2(n):
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), either 2 raised to the power of 31 (2147483648) or 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` equals `n`) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), either 2 raised to the power of 31 (2147483648) or 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` equals `n`) is printed. If `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), and `power` is either 31 or 32, then 2 raised to the power of 32 is printed if `power` is equal to `n`, otherwise 2 raised to the power of 31 which is 2147483648 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is either 30 or 31. If `power` is equal to `n`, 2^31 is printed. Otherwise, `power` is 30 and the value of 2 raised to the power of 30 which is 1073741824 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
