This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of cases to follow. For each case, if the integer is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the integer and prints the result of 2 raised to that power. The function processes all cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
