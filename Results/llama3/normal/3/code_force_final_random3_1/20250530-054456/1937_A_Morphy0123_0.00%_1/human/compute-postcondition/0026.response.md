Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), either 2 raised to the power of 31 (2147483648) or 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` equals `n`) is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer read from the input, which is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9), since one line has been read and processed. The other variables, `n_cases` and `i`, remain unchanged. The conditions for printing the number 1 or 2 raised to the power of 31 or `power` still apply.
