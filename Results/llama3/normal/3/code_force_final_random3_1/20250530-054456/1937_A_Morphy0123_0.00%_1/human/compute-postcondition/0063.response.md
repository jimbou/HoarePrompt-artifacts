Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 30, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). Additionally, `power` is not equal to `n`.**

The code decrements the value of `power` by 1, so its new value is 30. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each with an integer `n` between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The relationship between `power` and `n` is still that they are not equal.
