The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of 31.
Output: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 31, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9), and `power` is not equal to `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of 31 which is 2147483648 is being printed**
