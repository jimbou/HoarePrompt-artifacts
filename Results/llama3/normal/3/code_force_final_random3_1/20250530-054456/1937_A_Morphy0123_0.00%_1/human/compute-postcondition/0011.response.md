Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `power` being equal to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` within the specified range.
