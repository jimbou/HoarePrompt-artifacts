Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2^3 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 4, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `power` being equal to 4. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` within the specified range.
