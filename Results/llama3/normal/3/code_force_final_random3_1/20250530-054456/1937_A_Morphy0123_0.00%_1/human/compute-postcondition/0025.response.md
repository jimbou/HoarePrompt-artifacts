The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n_cases` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 2` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), either 2 raised to the power of 31 (2147483648) or 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` equals `n`) is printed.**
