Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value read from the first line of the stdin, which contains `n_cases - 4` lines. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n_cases - 5` lines, as one line has been read and processed.
