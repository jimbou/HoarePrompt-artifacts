Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been updated to 1. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).
