Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n_cases`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin is empty. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is an integer greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), either 2 raised to the power of 30 (1073741824) or 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` equals `n`) is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n_cases` remains unchanged, `i` has reached its final value equal to `n_cases`, and `n` has taken on its last value from the input. The standard input is now empty since all lines have been processed. The output depends on the last value of `n`: if it's 1, the number 1 is printed; otherwise, if `n` is greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9, either 2^30 (1073741824) or 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed, depending on whether `n` equals its calculated power or not.
