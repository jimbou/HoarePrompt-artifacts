Output State: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 32, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n_cases` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remains 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 32, and stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).
