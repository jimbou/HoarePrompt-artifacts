Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been initialized to 1. The other variables `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` retain their initial values, and the stdin still contains `n_cases - 5` lines of input.
