To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `power < log2(n)`. This condition must be true for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial states:

- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `power` is 1
- stdin contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)

The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`. The loop will execute if `power` is less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is initially 1, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

`log2(n) > 1` implies that `n` must be greater than 2 (since `2^1 = 2` and `log2(2) = 1`). Therefore, for the loop to certainly execute one time, `n` must be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since the condition only depends on `power` and `n`, and we've ensured that the condition can be met by adjusting the possible values of `n`.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**
