Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 31, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). Additionally, `power` is not equal to `n`.***
