Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 31, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9), and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `power` being 31. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, and the contents of stdin are still valid.
