To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `power < log2(n)`. The loop will execute if this condition is true.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `power` is 1
- stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)

The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is 1, for the loop to execute, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1.

`log2(n) > 1` implies that `n` must be greater than 2 (since `2^1 = 2` and `log2(2) = 1`). Therefore, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**
