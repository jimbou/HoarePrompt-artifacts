Output State: `n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2^floor(log2(n)) and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is floor(log2(n)) + 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `n` and `power`. The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`. After each iteration, `power` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, `power` will be equal to the floor of the base-2 logarithm of `n` plus 1. The value of `n` will be greater than 2 raised to the power of the floor of the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and less than or equal to 10^9. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and the contents of stdin remain the same.
