Output State: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 32, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n_cases` remains unchanged within the range of 1 to 10^4, `i` remains at 0, `n` is now an integer greater than 2^31 (2147483648) and less than or equal to 10^9, `power` has reached 32, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged with `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10^9.
