According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3 and `n` is an integer greater than 2^2 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive). `n` being greater than 2^2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2^3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2^3 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**
