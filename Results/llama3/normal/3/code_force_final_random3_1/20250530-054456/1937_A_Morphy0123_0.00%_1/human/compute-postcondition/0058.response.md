Output State: `n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 31, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that `n_cases` remains unchanged, `i` remains 2, `n` is greater than 2^30 and less than or equal to 10^9, `power` is 31, and the contents of stdin remain the same.
