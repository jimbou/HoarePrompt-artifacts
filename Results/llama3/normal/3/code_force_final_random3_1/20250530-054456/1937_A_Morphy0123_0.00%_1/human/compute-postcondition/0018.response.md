The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to the current value of `n`, which is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive).
Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2^31 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 32, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9). The current value of `power` is equal to the current value of `n`, and 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed**
