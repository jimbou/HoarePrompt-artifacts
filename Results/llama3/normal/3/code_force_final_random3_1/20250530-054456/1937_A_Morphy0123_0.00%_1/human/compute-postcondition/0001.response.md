To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n_cases`. 

For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be at least 1. Since `n_cases` is already given to be between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), this condition is already satisfied. However, we need to explicitly state the value of `i` before the loop starts. Since `i` is the loop counter, it should be 0 before the first iteration.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains `n_cases` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**
