Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2^2 and less than or equal to 10^9 (inclusive), `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1, so its new value is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` within the specified range.
