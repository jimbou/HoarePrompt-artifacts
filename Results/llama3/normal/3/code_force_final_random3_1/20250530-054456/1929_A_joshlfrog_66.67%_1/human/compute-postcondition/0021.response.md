The code prints the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list `nums`. The maximum value in `nums` is represented by `x`, and the minimum value in `nums` is represented by `y`. Since `x` and `y` are the maximum and minimum values in `nums`, respectively, the print statement will output the difference between these two values.

Output: **the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums**
