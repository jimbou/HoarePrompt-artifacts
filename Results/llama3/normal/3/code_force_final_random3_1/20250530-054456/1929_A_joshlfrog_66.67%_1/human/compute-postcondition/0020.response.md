Output State: **t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums, i is l-1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to be the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`, respectively. The loop counter `i` has reached its final value, which is `l-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables, `t`, `e`, `stdin`, and `nums`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
