Output State: **t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, if nums[i] is greater than 0, then the current value of x is the value of nums[i], otherwise the current value of x is 0, y is the current value of nums[i], i is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of y is updated to be the current value of nums[i], which is less than the original value of y (100000000). All other variables remain unchanged. The current value of x is still dependent on the value of nums[i], and the stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
