Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `e` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is equal to the current value of `nums[i]` which is greater than 0, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `nums[i]`, which is greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the list `nums` still contains l integers between 1 and 10^9.
