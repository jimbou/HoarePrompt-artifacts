Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, x is 0, y is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(l):
    if nums[i] > x:
        x = nums[i]
    if nums[i] < y:
        y = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, if nums[i] is greater than 0, then x is set to the value of nums[i], otherwise x remains 0, if nums[i] is less than y, then y is set to the value of nums[i], otherwise y remains 100000000, i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, x is the maximum value in nums, if nums[i] is less than y, then y is set to the value of nums[i], otherwise y remains the same, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `e` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9. If the third element in `nums` is less than the original minimum value in `nums`, then `y` is updated to be the third element in `nums`. If the third element in `nums` is greater than the original maximum value in `nums`, then `x` is updated to be the third element in `nums`. Otherwise, no change is made to `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
