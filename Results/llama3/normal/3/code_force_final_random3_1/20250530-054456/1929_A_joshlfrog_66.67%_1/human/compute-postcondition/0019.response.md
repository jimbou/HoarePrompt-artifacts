Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `e` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9. If the third element in `nums` is less than the original minimum value in `nums`, then `y` is updated to be the third element in `nums`. If the third element in `nums` is greater than the original maximum value in `nums`, then `x` is updated to be the third element in `nums`. Otherwise, no change is made to `x`.***
