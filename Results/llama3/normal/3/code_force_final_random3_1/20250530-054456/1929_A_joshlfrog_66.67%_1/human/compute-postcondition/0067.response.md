Output State: **t is at least 1, e is t-1, stdin is empty, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, i is l-1, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums which is x - y is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `e` has reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The input stream `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `l`, `nums`, `i`, `x`, and `y` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums` is being printed as the final output.
