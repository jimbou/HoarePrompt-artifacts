Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is assigned the value of the `i-th` element in the list `nums`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
