To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `e` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `e` and `t`. If `e` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is 0, and `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `e` must be increased by 1, so `e` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, `i` is `l-1`, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums` which is `x - y` is being printed**
