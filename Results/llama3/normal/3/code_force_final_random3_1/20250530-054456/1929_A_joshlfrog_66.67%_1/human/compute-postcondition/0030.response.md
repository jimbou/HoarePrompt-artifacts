Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `y` is the value of `nums[i]`, `i` is at least 0, `x` is the maximum of the original value of `x` and the value of `nums[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the value of `nums[i]`, which is less than the original value of `y` (100000000). The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still the maximum of its original value and the value of `nums[i]`.
