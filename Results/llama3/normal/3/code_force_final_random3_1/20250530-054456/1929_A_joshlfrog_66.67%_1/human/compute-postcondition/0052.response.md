Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, `y` is equal to `nums[0]`, `x` is either its initial value or `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than the initial value of `x`.**

The value of `y` has been updated to be equal to `nums[0]`, which is the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
