Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the elements in increasing order, but the program only finds the maximum and minimum elements and subtracts them, which is not the correct solution.

For example, if the input is [3, 1, 2], the program will output 1 (3 - 2), but the correct output should be 2 (2 - 1 + 3 - 2).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should sort the array in increasing order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
