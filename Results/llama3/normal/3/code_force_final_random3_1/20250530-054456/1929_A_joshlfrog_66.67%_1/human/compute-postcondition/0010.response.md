To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` is an integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `l` remains the same.

State: **t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, if nums[i] is greater than 0, then x is set to the value of nums[i], otherwise x remains 0, if nums[i] is less than y, then y is set to the value of nums[i], otherwise y remains 100000000, i is 1**
