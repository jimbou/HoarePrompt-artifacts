Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, e is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, x is 0, y is 100000000, i is l-1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(l):
    if nums[i] > x:
        x = nums[i]
    if nums[i] < y:
        y = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 0. If `nums[i]` is less than the original value of `y`, then `y` is updated to the value of `nums[i]` and `x` is updated to the maximum of the original value of `x` and the value of `nums[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 1. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `t`, `e`, `stdin`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 3 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `t`, `e`, `stdin`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
