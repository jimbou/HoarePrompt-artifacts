Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is equal to the current value of `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000, `i` is at least 0.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `nums[i]`, which is greater than the previous value of `x` (0). The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
