The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The first integer `t` is assigned to the variable `t`, and the remaining input is left in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**
