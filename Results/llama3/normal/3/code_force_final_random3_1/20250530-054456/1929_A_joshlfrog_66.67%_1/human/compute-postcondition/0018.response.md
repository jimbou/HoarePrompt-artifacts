Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `e` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `y` is the value of `nums[2]`, `i` is 2. If the third element in `nums` is greater than the original maximum value in `nums`, then `x` is updated to be the third element in `nums`. Otherwise, no change is made to `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the third element in the list `nums`, which is `nums[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still dependent on whether the third element in `nums` is greater than the original maximum value in `nums`.
