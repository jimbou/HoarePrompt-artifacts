Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, `x` is `nums[1]`, if `nums[1]` is greater than the initial value of `x`, then `y` is still set to `nums[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to `nums[1]`, which is the second element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `y` is still set to `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is less than the initial value of `y`.
