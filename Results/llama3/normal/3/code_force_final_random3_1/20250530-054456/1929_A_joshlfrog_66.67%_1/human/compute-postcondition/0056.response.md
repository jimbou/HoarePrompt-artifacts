Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` is greater than the initial value of `x`, then `x` is set to `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to `nums[1]`. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to `nums[1]` and `y` is still set to `nums[1]`.***
