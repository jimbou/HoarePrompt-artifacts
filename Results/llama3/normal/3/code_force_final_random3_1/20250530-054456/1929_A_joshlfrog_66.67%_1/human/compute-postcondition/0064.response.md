Output State: **t is at least 3, e is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, i is l, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `l`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `x` now holds the maximum value present in the list `nums`, and the variable `y` holds the minimum value present in the list `nums`. The other variables `t`, `e`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
