Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 3 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 2, `x` is either updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than `x` or remains unchanged, and `y` is updated to `nums[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `e`, `stdin`, `l`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` may or may not be updated to `nums[i]` depending on whether `nums[i]` is greater than `x`. The value of `y` is updated to `nums[i]`.
