The code prints the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list `nums`. The maximum value in `nums` is `x` and the minimum value in `nums` is `y`. Since `x` and `y` are the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums` respectively, the print statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.
Output: **the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums**
