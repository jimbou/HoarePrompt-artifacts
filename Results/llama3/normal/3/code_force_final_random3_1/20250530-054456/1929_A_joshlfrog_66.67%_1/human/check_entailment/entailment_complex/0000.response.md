Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array elements `nums`. It then initializes two variables `x` and `y` to keep track of the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.

The program then iterates over the array elements and updates `x` and `y` accordingly. Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which represents the maximum beauty of the array.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The use of `x` and `y` to keep track of the maximum and minimum values is efficient, and the program handles multiple test cases correctly.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. The variable `y` is initialized to a large value (100000000), which is not necessary. Instead, `y` can be initialized to the first element of the array, and then updated accordingly. This would make the program more efficient and easier to understand.

Despite this minor issue, the program's correctness is not affected, and it should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
