Output State: **t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, x is equal to nums[1], if nums[1] is less than y, then y is set to the value of nums[1], otherwise y remains 100000000, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of x is updated to be equal to the second element of the list nums (since i is 1). The value of y remains the same if nums[1] is not less than y, otherwise, it is updated to be equal to nums[1]. The other variables remain unchanged.
