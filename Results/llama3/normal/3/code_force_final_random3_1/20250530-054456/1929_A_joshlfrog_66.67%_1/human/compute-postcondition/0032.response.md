The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `l` must be greater than the new value of `i`. So `i` is at least 1 and `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 1**
