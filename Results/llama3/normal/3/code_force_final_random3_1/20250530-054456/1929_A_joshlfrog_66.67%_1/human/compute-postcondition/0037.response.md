The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `l` must be greater than the new value of `i`. So, `i` is at least 2 and `l` is an integer between 3 and 100 and must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 3 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `t`, `e`, `stdin`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `x`.**
