To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and `e` since they are the only variables in the loop head.


According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, we can adjust the state to `t` is at least 1.


Additionally, since `e` is the loop variable, we can adjust its state to `e` is 0, which is the starting value of the range.


State: **`t` is at least 1, `e` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**
