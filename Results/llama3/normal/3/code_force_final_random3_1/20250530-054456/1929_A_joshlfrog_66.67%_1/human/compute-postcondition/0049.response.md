Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, `x` is `nums[0]`, `y` is 100000000. The current value of `nums[i]` is equal to `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `nums[i]`, which is `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `nums[i]` is now equal to `x`, indicating that the value of `x` has been updated to the current value of the first element in the list `nums`.
