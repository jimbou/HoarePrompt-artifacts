Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, if nums[i] is greater than x, then x is set to the value of nums[i], otherwise x remains the same, if nums[i] is less than y, then y is set to the value of nums[i], otherwise y remains 100000000, i is 1***
