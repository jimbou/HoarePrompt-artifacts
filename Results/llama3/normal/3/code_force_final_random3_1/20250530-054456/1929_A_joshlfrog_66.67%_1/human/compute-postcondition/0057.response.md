Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, `x` is either `nums[1]` or greater than `nums[1]`, `y` is `nums[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to `nums[1]`, which is the second element of the list `nums`. The value of `x` remains either `nums[1]` or greater than `nums[1]`, as it was before the code execution. The other variables `t`, `e`, `stdin`, `l`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged.
