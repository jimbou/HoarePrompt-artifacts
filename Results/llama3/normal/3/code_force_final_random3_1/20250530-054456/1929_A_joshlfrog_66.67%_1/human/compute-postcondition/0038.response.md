Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 3 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and is equal to `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to the `i-th` element of the list `nums`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `y` is still conditional, depending on whether `nums[i]` is less than `y`.
