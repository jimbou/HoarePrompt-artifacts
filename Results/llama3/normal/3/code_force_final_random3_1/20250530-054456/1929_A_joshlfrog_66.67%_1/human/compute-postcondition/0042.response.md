Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is `l`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `t`, `e`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `l` is still between 2 and 100, and `nums` is still a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9. The variable `i` has reached the end of the list, so its value is now `l`. The variable `x` has been updated to the maximum value in the list `nums`, and the variable `y` has been updated to the minimum value in the list `nums`.
