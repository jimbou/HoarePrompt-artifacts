To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(l):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` is an integer between 2 and 100.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `l` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`t`, `e`, `stdin`, `nums`, `x`, and `y`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `e` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums` (or the value of `nums[0]`), `i` is 2**
