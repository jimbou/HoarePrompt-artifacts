Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `e` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the value of `nums[1]`, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to the value of `nums[1]`, which is the second element in the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
