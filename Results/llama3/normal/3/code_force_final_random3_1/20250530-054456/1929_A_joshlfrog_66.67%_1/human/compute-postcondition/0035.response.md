Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 1, `y` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, If `y` is greater than `x`, then `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `t`, `e`, `stdin`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is assigned the value of `nums[i]`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `x` is only affected if `y` is greater than `x`, in which case `x` is also an integer between 1 and 10^9.
