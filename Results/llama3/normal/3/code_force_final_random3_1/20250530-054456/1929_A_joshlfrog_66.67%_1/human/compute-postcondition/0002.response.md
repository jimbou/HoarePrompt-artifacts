Output State: **t is at least 1, e is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, x is 0, y is 100000000.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains at least 1, and the value of `e` remains 0. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, leaving `t-1` test cases. The variable `l` is assigned an integer value between 2 and 100, which is the number of integers in the current test case. The variable `nums` is assigned a list of `l` integers, each between 1 and 10^9. The variable `x` is initialized to 0, and the variable `y` is initialized to 100000000.
