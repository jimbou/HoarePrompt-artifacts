Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `x` is either `nums[1]` or greater than `nums[1]`, and `y` is `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their previous values.***
