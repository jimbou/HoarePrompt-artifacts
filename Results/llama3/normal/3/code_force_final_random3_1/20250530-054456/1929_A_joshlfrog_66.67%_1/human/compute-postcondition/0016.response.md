The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `i` is 2, `x` is assigned the value of the third element in the list `nums` (because list indices start at 0). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `e` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `x` is the third element in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums` (or the value of `nums[0]`), `i` is 2**
