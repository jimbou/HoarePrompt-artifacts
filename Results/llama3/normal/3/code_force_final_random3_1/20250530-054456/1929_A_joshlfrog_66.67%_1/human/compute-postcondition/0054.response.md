The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, if `nums[1]` is greater than the initial value of `x`, then `x` is set to `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to `nums[1]`.**
