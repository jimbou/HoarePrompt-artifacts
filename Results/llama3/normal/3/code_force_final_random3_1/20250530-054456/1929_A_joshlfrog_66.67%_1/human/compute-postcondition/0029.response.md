Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `y` is 100000000, `i` is at least 0. The current value of `x` is the maximum of the original value of `x` and the value of `nums[i]`. The current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.***
