The code prints the difference between the maximum value `x` and the minimum value `y` in the list `nums`. Where `x` is the maximum value in `nums` and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, and `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9.
Output: ** `t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is `l`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums` which is x - y is being printed**
