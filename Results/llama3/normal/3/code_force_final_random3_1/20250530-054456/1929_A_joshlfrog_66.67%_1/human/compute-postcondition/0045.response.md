The only variable in the loop head is variable `e` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `e` and `t`. If `e` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `e` must be increased by 1, so `e` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is `l`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`**
