Output State: **t is at least 2, e is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, l is an integer between 2 and 100, nums is a list of l integers between 1 and 10^9, x is 0, y is 100000000, i is l-1**

The code block reads the value of `l` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `l`. Then, it reads `l` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The variables `x` and `y` are initialized to 0 and 100000000, respectively. The variable `i` is not modified by the code block, so its value remains `l-1`. The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums` is not printed in this code block, as the print statement is not included. The stdin now contains `t-3` test cases.
