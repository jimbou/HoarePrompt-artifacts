Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array elements `nums`.
3. It initializes two variables `x` and `y` to keep track of the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.
4. It iterates over the array elements and updates `x` and `y` accordingly.
5. Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple test cases and printing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
