Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program works as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the elements of the array `nums`.
3. It initializes two variables `x` and `y` to keep track of the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.
4. It iterates through the array and updates `x` and `y` accordingly.
5. Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which represents the maximum beauty of the array.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. By finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and subtracting the minimum from the maximum, it effectively calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the definition of the beauty of the array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
