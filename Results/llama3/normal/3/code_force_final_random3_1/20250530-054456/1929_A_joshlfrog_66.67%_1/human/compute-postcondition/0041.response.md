Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `e` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `l` is an integer between 3 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is at least 2. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `t`, `e`, `stdin`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `x`.***
