Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `e` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `l` is an integer between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `l` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, if `nums[0]` is greater than the initial value of `x`, then `x` is set to `nums[0]`. If `nums[0]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to `nums[0]`.***
