Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of pairs (rx, ry) where rx is the remainder of -a divided by x and ry is the remainder of a divided by y for each element a in arr. The function then returns a list of sums of these frequencies for each test case, effectively counting the occurrences of pairs (rx, ry) across all elements in arr for each test case.

`func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` to process the test cases. It then prints the results.

The program correctly implements the problem description by counting the number of beautiful pairs in the array a for each test case. A pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y. The program uses the frequency of pairs (rx, ry) to count the occurrences of beautiful pairs.

Correctness: **True**
