Functionality: This function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by calculating the frequency of pairs (rx, ry) in the list arr, where rx is the remainder of -a divided by x and ry is the remainder of a divided by y. The function then returns a list of sums of these frequencies for each test case, with the same number of elements as the number of test cases in the input list.
