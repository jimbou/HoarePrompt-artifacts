Postcondition: ***test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, n, x, and y are the third test case in the list, arr is the third test case in the list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list, rx is (-a % x + x) % x, ry is a % y. If the pair (rx, ry) is in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry), count is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq, and current_pair is (rx, ry). Otherwise, freq remains an empty dictionary, count remains 0, and current_pair remains undefined.***
