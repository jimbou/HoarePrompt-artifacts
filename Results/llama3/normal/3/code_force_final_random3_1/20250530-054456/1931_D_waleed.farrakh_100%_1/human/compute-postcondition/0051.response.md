Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is not exhausted and must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y), and freq is a dictionary that contains the pair (rx, ry) with a frequency of 1.**

In this output state, the code has added a new pair (rx, ry) to the dictionary freq with a frequency of 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The pair (rx, ry) is now included in freq, and its frequency is set to 1.
