Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, n, x, and y are the third test case in the list, arr is the third test case in the list that must have at least 1 element, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0, a is the first element in the list, rx is (-a % x + x) % x, ry is a % y, and current_pair is undefined.**

In this output state, the values of `rx` and `ry` have been updated based on the calculations performed in the code. The value of `rx` is now `(-a % x + x) % x`, which is the result of the first line of code. The value of `ry` is now `a % y`, which is the result of the second line of code. All other variables remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code.
