According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, which means it is a list of results. For the loop to be executed, `results` must have at least 1 result and `result` is the first result in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `y` is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, `idx` is incremented by 2 * t, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t - 1, `test_cases` has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), `results` is a list of results that must have at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list**
