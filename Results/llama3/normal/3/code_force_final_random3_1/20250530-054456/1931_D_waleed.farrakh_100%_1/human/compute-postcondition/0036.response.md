Postcondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, n, x, and y are the second test case in the list, arr is not exhausted and must have at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry), count is 0, a is the first element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, and current_pair is equal to (a % x, a % y). The current value of rx and ry is a pair that exists in freq.**
