State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x), `ry` is (a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either incremented by one if the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair (a % x, a % y) does not exist in freq, `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq incremented by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq if the pair (rx, ry) exists in freq, otherwise `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq, and `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y). If the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq, the frequency of the pair (a % x, a % y) in freq is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the frequency of the pair (a % x, a % y) in freq is set to 1.
