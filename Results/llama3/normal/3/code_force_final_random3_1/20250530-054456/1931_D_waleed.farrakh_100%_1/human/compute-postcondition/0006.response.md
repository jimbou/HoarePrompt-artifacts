Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, x is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, y is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, arr is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is incremented by 2, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2**

The code snippet provided updates the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` based on the data at the current index `idx` and the next index `idx + 1`. It then appends a new tuple containing these values to the `test_cases` list and increments the index `idx` by 2. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
