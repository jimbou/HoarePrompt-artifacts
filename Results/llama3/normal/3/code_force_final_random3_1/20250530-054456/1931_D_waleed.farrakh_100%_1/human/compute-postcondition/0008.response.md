Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `y` is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, `idx` is incremented by 2 * t, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t - 1, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, and `test_cases` has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `idx`, `t`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the addition of a new variable `results`, which is assigned the return value of the function `func_1` when called with the argument `test_cases`. The `test_cases` variable now has a new tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
