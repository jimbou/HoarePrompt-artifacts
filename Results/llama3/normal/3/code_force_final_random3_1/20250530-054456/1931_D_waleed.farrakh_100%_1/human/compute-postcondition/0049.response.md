Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is not exhausted and must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y), and if the pair (rx, ry) is in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) and count is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq which is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq contains the pair (rx, ry) with a frequency of 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `current_pair` has been updated to be equal to (a % x, a % y). All other variables remain unchanged.
