The code snippet provided is designed to process data from a list of strings (`data`) and append a new tuple to a list of test cases (`test_cases`). It does this by parsing two lines of data from `data` starting at the index `idx`, extracting integers from these lines, and then appending a tuple of these integers along with a list of integers to `test_cases`. After processing, it increments `idx` by 2 to move to the next set of data lines.

Here's a breakdown of how the code affects the variables and the final state:

1. `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())`: This line takes the string at index `idx` in `data`, splits it into parts (assuming it's space-separated), converts these parts into integers, and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y`, respectively. This operation modifies the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` based on the data in `data[idx]`.

2. `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))`: This line does a similar operation to the first but for the string at index `idx + 1` in `data`. It splits the string, converts the parts into integers, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`.

3. `test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))`: This line adds a new tuple to the end of `test_cases`. The tuple contains the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `arr` that were extracted from `data`.

4. `idx += 2`: This line increments `idx` by 2, effectively moving the index forward by two positions in `data` to point to the next set of data lines.

Given the initial state and the operations performed by the code, the final state can be described as follows:

- `n`, `x`, and `y` are now integers based on the data extracted from `data[idx]`.
- `arr` is a list of integers based on the data extracted from `data[idx + 1]`.
- `test_cases` has been appended with a new tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- `idx` has been incremented by 2, pointing to the next set of data in `data`.
- `t`, `_`, and the original values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` before the execution are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **n, x, and y are integers from data[idx], arr is a list of integers from data[idx + 1], test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is incremented by 2, t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0**
