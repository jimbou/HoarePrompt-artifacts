Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, n, x, and y are the third test case in the list, arr is the third test case in the list, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0, a is undefined, rx is undefined, ry is undefined, and current_pair is undefined**

The code snippet provided resets the `freq` dictionary and the `count` variable. The `freq` dictionary is now empty, and the `count` variable is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
