Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first test case in the list, `arr` is exhausted, `freq` is a dictionary where the frequency of each pair (`rx`, `ry`) is incremented by 1 if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise the key (`rx`, `ry`) has a value of 1, `count` is equal to the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq`, `a` is the last element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is exhausted, `freq` is a dictionary that contains all pairs (rx, ry) with their frequencies, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `a` is the last element in the list arr, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, and `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq plus the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq incremented by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq if the pair (rx, ry) exists in freq, otherwise the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the last element in the list, `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x), `ry` is (a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either incremented by one if the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair (a % x, a % y) does not exist in freq, `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq incremented by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq if the pair (rx, ry) exists in freq, otherwise count is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq, and `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y). If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the frequency of the pair (a % x, a % y) in `freq` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
