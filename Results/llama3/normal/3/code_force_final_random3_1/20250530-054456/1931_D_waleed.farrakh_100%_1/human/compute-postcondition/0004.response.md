Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, x is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, y is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, arr is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is incremented by 2, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `test_cases`, and `idx`. The first line assigns the first three integers in the tuple at index `idx` in `data` to `n`, `x`, and `y`, respectively. The second line assigns the list of integers in the tuple at index `idx + 1` in `data` to `arr`. The third line appends a new tuple containing the current values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to `test_cases`. The fourth line increments `idx` by 2. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
