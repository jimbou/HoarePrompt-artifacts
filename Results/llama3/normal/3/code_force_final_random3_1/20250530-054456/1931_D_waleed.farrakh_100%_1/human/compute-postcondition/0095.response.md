Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list with a number of elements equal to the number of test cases in the initial `test_cases` list, each element being the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq` for each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the last test case in the initial `test_cases` list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) with their frequencies for the last test case, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq` for the last test case, `a` is the last element in the list `arr` of the last test case, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `test_cases` list is exhausted, and the `results` list contains the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq` for each test case. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` hold the values of the last test case, and the dictionary `freq` contains all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) with their frequencies for the last test case. The variable `count` holds the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq` for the last test case, and the variables `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` hold the values corresponding to the last element in the list `arr` of the last test case.
