Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, n, x, and y are the third test case in the list, arr is the third test case in the list, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0, a is undefined, rx is undefined, ry is undefined, and current_pair is undefined
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either incremented by one if the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair (a % x, a % y) does not exist in freq, and `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x), `ry` is (a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either incremented by one if the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair (a % x, a % y) does not exist in freq, `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq incremented by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq if the pair (rx, ry) exists in freq, otherwise `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq, and `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y). If the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq, the frequency of the pair (a % x, a % y) in freq is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the frequency of the pair (a % x, a % y) in freq is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x), `ry` is (a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either incremented by one if the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair (a % x, a % y) does not exist in freq, `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq incremented by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq if the pair (rx, ry) exists in freq, otherwise `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq, and `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y). If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the frequency of the pair (a % x, a % y) in `freq` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
