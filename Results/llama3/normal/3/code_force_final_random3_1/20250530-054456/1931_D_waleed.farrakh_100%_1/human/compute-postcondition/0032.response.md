To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head consists of the variables `(n, x, y, arr)` and the list `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, and `(n, x, y, arr)` represents the first test case in the list. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases.

So, we adjust the state of `test_cases` to have at least 2 test cases, and `(n, x, y, arr)` becomes the second test case in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is not exhausted, `freq` is a dictionary where the frequency of each pair (`rx`, `ry`) is reset, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`).**
