Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
    arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
    idx += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, x, and y are integers from data[idx], arr is a list of integers from data[idx + 1], test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is incremented by 2, t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, x is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, y is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, arr is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is incremented by 2, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, x is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, y is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, arr is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is incremented by 2, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
