Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is 1.**

Explanation:
The code reads the entire standard input into the variable `data` as a list of strings, where each string represents a line of input. The first line of input is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`. The variable `idx` is initialized to 1. The list `test_cases` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not modified by the code, so they retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.
