The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1 and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, x is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, y is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, arr is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is incremented by 2, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2**
