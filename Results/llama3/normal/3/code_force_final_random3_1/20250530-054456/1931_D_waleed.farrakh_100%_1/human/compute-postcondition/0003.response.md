To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`. According to the code, `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `t`. Since `_` is incremented by 1, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1.

The other variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `test_cases`, `idx`, and `t` are not directly related to the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `test_cases` has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), `idx` is incremented by 2, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1**
