Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, x is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, y is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, arr is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is incremented by 2 * t, t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables n, x, and y are integers equal to the first, second, and third integers in the tuple at index idx in data, respectively. The variable arr is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data. The list test_cases has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr) appended to it. The variable idx is incremented by 2 times the value of t. The variable t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and the variable _ is equal to t - 1.
