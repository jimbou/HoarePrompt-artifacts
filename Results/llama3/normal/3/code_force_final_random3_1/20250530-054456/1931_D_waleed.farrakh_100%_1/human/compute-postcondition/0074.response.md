Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency of 1, `count` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, results, n, x, y, arr, a, rx, and ry remain unchanged. The dictionary freq now contains the pair current_pair with a frequency of 1. The variable count remains 0.
