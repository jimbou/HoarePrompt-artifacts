Based on the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the first result in the list of results.

Since the exact value of the first result in the list of results is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the result. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first result in the list of results.

Output: **the first result in the list of results**
