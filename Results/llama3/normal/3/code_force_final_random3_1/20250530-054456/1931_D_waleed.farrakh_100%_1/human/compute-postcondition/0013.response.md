Based on the precondition, the `print(result)` statement will print the second result in the list `results`.

Since the exact values of `results` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second result in the list.

Output: **the second result in the list results**
