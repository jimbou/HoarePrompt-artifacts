Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, n, x, and y are the second test case in the list, arr is not exhausted, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0, a is the first element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, and current_pair is equal to (a % x, a % y).
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is not exhausted and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y), and if the pair (rx, ry) is in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) and count is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq which is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq contains the pair (rx, ry) with a frequency of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is not exhausted and must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y), and freq is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either increased by 1 if the pair already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair does not exist in freq.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is not exhausted and must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either increased by 1 if the pair already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair does not exist in freq, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y), and if the pair (rx, ry) exists in freq, then `count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq. If `current_pair` exists in `freq`, the frequency of `current_pair` in `freq` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
