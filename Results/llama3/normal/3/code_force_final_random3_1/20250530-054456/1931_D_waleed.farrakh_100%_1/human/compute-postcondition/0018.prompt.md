Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `y` is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, `idx` is incremented by 2 * t, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t - 1, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, and `test_cases` has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr).
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `y` is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, `idx` is incremented by 2 * t, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t - 1, `test_cases` has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), `results` is a list of results that must have at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list, and the first result in the list which is result is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `y` is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, `idx` is incremented by 2 * t, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t - 1, `test_cases` has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), `results` is a list of results that must have at least 2 results, and the second result in the list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `y` is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, `idx` is incremented by 2 * t, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t - 1, `test_cases` has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), `results` is a list of results that must have at least 3 results, and the third result in the list is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
