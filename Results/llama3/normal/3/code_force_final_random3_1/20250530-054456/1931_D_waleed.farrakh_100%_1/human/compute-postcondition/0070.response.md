Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `freq` is either a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) or an empty dictionary, `count` is either equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq or 0.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `rx`, and `ry` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `current_pair` is updated to `(a % x, a % y)`, which is a new pair calculated based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `freq` and `count` are either updated or remain the same, depending on whether the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the dictionary `freq`.
