You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers.
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        
        count = 0
        
        for a in arr:
            rx = (-a % x + x) % x
            ry = a % y
            if (rx, ry) in freq:
                count += freq[rx, ry]
            current_pair = a % x, a % y
            if current_pair in freq:
                freq[current_pair] += 1
            else:
                freq[current_pair] = 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list with a number of elements equal to the number of test cases in the initial `test_cases` list, each element being the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq` for each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the last test case in the initial `test_cases` list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) with their frequencies for the last test case, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq` for the last test case, `a` is the last element in the list `arr` of the last test case, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`).
    return results
    #The program returns a list of sums of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) for each test case, where each sum is equal to the count of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in the freq dictionary for the corresponding test case. The list has the same number of elements as the number of test cases in the initial test_cases list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of sums of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) for each test case, where each sum is equal to the count of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in the freq dictionary for the corresponding test case. The list has the same number of elements as the number of test cases in the initial test_cases list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
