Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first test case in the list, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a dictionary where the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) is incremented by 1 if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise the key (`rx`, `ry`) has a value of 1, `count` is equal to the previous count plus the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise `count` is equal to the previous count plus 1, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`).**

The code assigns `current_pair` the value of (`a % x`, `a % y`). The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new value of `current_pair`.
