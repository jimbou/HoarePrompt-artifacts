Output State: **The program returns a list of sums of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) for each test case, where each sum is equal to the count of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in the freq dictionary for the corresponding test case. The list has the same number of elements as the number of test cases in the initial test_cases list.**

In this output state, each element in the results list represents the sum of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) for a specific test case. The sum is calculated by adding up the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in the freq dictionary for that test case. The list has the same number of elements as the number of test cases in the initial test_cases list, indicating that each test case has a corresponding sum of frequencies in the results list.
