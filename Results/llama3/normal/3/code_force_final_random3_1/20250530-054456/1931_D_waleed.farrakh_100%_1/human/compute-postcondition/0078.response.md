Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x), `ry` is (a % y), `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either incremented by one if the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair (a % x, a % y) does not exist in freq, and `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq incremented by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, results, n, x, y, arr, a, rx, ry, current_pair, and freq remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of count is incremented by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq.
