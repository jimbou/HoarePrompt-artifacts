Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is not exhausted and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y), and if the pair (rx, ry) is in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) and count is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq. Otherwise, freq remains empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code updates the value of `current_pair` to be equal to (a % x, a % y), which is the remainder of a divided by x and y, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `test_cases` still has at least 2 test cases, `results` still has an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are still the second test case in the list, `arr` is still not exhausted and must have at least 1 element, `a` is still the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is still the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is still the remainder of a divided by y, and freq and count are still the same unless the pair (rx, ry) is in freq.
