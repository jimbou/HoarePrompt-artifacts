Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is exhausted, `freq` is a dictionary that contains all pairs (rx, ry) with their frequencies, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `a` is the last element in the list arr, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, and `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y).**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now has an additional element, which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in the dictionary `freq`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `test_cases` still having at least 2 test cases, `n`, `x`, and `y` still being the second test case, `arr` still being exhausted, and `freq` still containing all pairs (rx, ry) with their frequencies. The values of `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` also remain the same.
