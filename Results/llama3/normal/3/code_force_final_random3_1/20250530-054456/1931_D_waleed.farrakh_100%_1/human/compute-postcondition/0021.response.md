Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first test case in the list, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary where the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) is incremented by 1 if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise the key (`rx`, `ry`) has a value of 1, `count` is equal to the previous count plus the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise `count` is equal to the previous count plus 1, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`). If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, the frequency of `current_pair` in `freq` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.**
