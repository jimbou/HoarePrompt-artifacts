Reasoning: The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It calculates the frequency of pairs (rx, ry) where rx is the remainder of -a divided by x and ry is the remainder of a divided by y for each element a in arr. The function then returns a list of sums of these frequencies for each test case, effectively counting the occurrences of pairs (rx, ry) across all elements in arr for each test case.

func_2 reads the input from the standard input, parses it into a list of test cases, and calls func_1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The use of the freq dictionary in func_1 to count the occurrences of pairs (rx, ry) is efficient and correct. The program also handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
