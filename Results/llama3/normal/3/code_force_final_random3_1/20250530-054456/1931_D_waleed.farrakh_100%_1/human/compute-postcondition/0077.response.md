Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, n, x, and y are the third test case in the list, arr is the third test case in the list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, rx is ((-a % x + x) % x), ry is (a % y), current_pair is (a % x, a % y), freq is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either incremented by one if the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair (a % x, a % y) does not exist in freq, and count is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq.**

The code snippet does not modify any variables. The values of `rx` and `ry` are recalculated based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`, but these calculations do not affect the overall state of the program. The `freq` dictionary and the `count` variable are not modified by the code snippet.
