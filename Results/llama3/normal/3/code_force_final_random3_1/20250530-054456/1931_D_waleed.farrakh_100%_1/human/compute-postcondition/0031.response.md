Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first test case in the list, `arr` is exhausted, `freq` is a dictionary where the frequency of each pair (`rx`, `ry`) is incremented by 1 if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise the key (`rx`, `ry`) has a value of 1, `count` is equal to the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq`, `a` is the last element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`).**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (`rx`, `ry`) in `freq`, in addition to its previous elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
