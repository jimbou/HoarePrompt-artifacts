Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the second test case in the list, `arr` is not exhausted and must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either increased by 1 if the pair already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair does not exist in freq, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is equal to (a % x, a % y), and if the pair (rx, ry) exists in freq, then `count` is increased by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq. If `current_pair` exists in `freq`, the frequency of `current_pair` in `freq` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.**
