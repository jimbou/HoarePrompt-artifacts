Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `x` is an integer equal to the second integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `y` is an integer equal to the third integer in the tuple at index idx in data, `arr` is a list of integers equal to the integers in the tuple at index idx + 1 in data, `idx` is incremented by 2 * t, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is t - 1, `test_cases` has a new tuple (n, x, y, arr), `results` is a list of results that must have at least as many results as the length of the results list, and all results in the list have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `idx`, `t`, and `_` retain their initial values, and `test_cases` still has the new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. The loop has iterated over all the results in the `results` list, printing each one. The number of iterations is equal to the length of the `results` list.
