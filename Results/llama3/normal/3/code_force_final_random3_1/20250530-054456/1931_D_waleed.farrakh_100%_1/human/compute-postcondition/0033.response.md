Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, n, x, and y are the second test case in the list, arr is not exhausted, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0, a is the first element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, and current_pair is equal to (a % x, a % y).**

The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `freq` and sets the variable `count` to 0. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for `freq` which is now an empty dictionary. The rest of the variables retain their original values.
