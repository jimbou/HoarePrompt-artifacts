Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x), `ry` is (a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with a frequency that is either incremented by one if the pair (a % x, a % y) already exists in freq or set to 1 if the pair (a % x, a % y) does not exist in freq, `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq incremented by the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq if the pair (rx, ry) exists in freq, otherwise `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq, and `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y).**

In this output state, the value of `current_pair` has been updated to `(a % x, a % y)`, which is a new pair calculated based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state.
