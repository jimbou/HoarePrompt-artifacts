Functionality: This function processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of pairs (rx, ry) where rx is the remainder of -a divided by x and ry is the remainder of a divided by y for each element a in arr. The function then returns a list of sums of these frequencies for each test case, effectively counting the occurrences of pairs (rx, ry) across all elements in arr for each test case.
