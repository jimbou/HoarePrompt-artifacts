Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in freq, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the third test case in the list, `arr` is the third test case in the list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one pair (rx, ry) with an incremented frequency of the pair (a % x, a % y), and `count` is equal to the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) in freq plus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The frequency of the current pair (a % x, a % y) in the frequency dictionary freq has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
