Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n, x, y, and arr are the first test case in the list, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first test case in the list, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary where the frequency of the current pair (rx, ry) is incremented by 1 if (rx, ry) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise the key (rx, ry) has a value of 1, `count` is equal to the previous count plus 1, `a` is the first element in the list arr, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, and `current_pair` is equal to (rx, ry).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first test case in the list, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary where the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) is incremented by 1 if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise the key (`rx`, `ry`) has a value of 1, `count` is equal to the previous count plus the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise `count` is equal to the previous count plus 1, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`). If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, the frequency of `current_pair` in `freq` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first test case in the list, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a dictionary where the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) is incremented by 1 if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise the key (`rx`, `ry`) has a value of 1, `count` is equal to the previous count plus the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) if (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise `count` is equal to the previous count plus 1, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is equal to (`a % x`, `a % y`). If the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) is already a key in the dictionary `freq`, then the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the frequency of the current pair (`rx`, `ry`) is now 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
