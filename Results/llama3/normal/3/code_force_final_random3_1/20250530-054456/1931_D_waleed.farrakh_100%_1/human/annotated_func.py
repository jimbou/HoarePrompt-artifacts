    #The program returns a list of sums of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) for each test case, where each sum is equal to the count of frequencies of all pairs (rx, ry) in the freq dictionary for the corresponding test case. The list has the same number of elements as the number of test cases in the initial test_cases list.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of pairs (rx, ry) where rx is the remainder of -a divided by x and ry is the remainder of a divided by y for each element a in arr. The function then returns a list of sums of these frequencies for each test case, effectively counting the occurrences of pairs (rx, ry) across all elements in arr for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. The function does not modify the input test cases or any external state. The purpose of the function is to compute and return a list of results based on the input test cases.
