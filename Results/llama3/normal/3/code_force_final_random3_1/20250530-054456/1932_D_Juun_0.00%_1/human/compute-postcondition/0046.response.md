The `print` statement will print two strings, each containing a rank and a suit. The ranks are popped from the `trumps` list, and the suit is the value of the `trump` variable, which is a single character representing one of the suits ("CDHS").

Since `trumps` is a non-empty list, popping two elements from it will result in two ranks being printed. The exact ranks cannot be determined without knowing the contents of the `trumps` list.

The suit printed with each rank is the value of the `trump` variable, which is one of "CDHS".

Output: **[rank1][trump] [rank2][trump] (where rank1 and rank2 are the popped ranks from the trumps list and trump is the value of the trump variable)**
