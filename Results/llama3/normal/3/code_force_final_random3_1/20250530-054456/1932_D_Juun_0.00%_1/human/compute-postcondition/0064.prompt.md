Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: trumps is an empty list, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, and all possible combinations of two ranks from trumps followed by trump are printed.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, and all possible combinations of two ranks from trumps followed by trump are printed, and must have at least 1 element, `answer` is the first element in the list, and the first element in the list `answers` which is `answer` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, and all possible combinations of two ranks from trumps followed by trump are printed, and must have at least 2 elements, `answer` is the second element in the list, and the second element of the list which is [answer] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, and all possible combinations of two ranks from trumps followed by trump are printed, and must have at least 3 elements, `answer` is the third element in the list, and the third element of the list `answers` which is `answer` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
