Output State: **trumps is an empty list, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, and all possible combinations of two ranks from trumps followed by trump are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `trumps` is empty, the list `answers` contains all the cards in the deck, with the cards of the same suit as `trump` sorted alphabetically, and all possible combinations of two ranks from `trumps` followed by `trump` are printed.
