Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, and all possible combinations of two ranks from trumps followed by trump are printed, and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `answer` is the last element in the list, and the last element of the list `answers` which is `answer` is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `trumps` list remains empty, the `answers` list contains all the elements that were printed during the loop's execution, and the `answer` variable holds the last element that was printed. The number of elements in the `answers` list is equal to the number of iterations of the loop.
