Functionality: **This function processes a set of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of cards with ranks and suits. It then prints out all possible combinations of two cards, where the suits are either the same or one is a trump suit. If there are not enough trumps to pair with all non-trump cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly to the console.**
