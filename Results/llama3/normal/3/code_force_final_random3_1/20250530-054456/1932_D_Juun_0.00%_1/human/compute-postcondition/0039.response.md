Postcondition: ***stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a non-empty list containing the ranks of all cards in the input().split() with one element removed, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with an additional element that is a string containing the rank and suit of the current card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least 3 values are None, suit is 'D'. If rank is None, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration.***
