Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the ranks of all cards in the input().split() if the suit of any card is equal to trump, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a non-empty list containing the ranks of all cards in the input().split() with one element removed, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with an additional element that is a string containing the rank and suit of the current card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, suit is 'C'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a non-empty list containing the ranks of all cards in the input().split() with one element removed, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with an additional element that is a string containing the rank and suit of the current card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least 3 values are None, suit is 'D'. If rank is None, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` contains 0 test cases, `trump` is a single character (one of "CDHS"), `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the ranks of all cards in the input().split() with one element removed, `answers` is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to `trump`, with an additional element that is a string containing the rank and suit of the current card, followed by the popped rank from `trumps` and the `trump` suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least 3 values are None, `suit` is 'H'. If `rank` is `None`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
