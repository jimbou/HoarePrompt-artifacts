The variable in the loop head is trumps, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable trumps.  If trumps is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, trumps is a list with at least 1 element, So for the loop to be executed one more time trumps must have at least 2 elements.
