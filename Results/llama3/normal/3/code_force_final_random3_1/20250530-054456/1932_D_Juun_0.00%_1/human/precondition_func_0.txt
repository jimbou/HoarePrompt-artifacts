stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the second line contains a single character (one of "CDHS"), and the third line contains 2n two-character strings (each string consists of a character from "23456789" followed by a character from "CDHS"). All 2n strings are different.
