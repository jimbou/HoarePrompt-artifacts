Output State: **stdin contains t-2 or t-3 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise it is an empty list, answers is a list with an additional element that is a string containing the rank and suit of the first card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump, otherwise it is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key suit set to None if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise the value of suits[suit] is rank, and rank and suit are the rank and suit of the second card in the input().split() respectively.**

In this output state, the values of trump, trumps, answers, and suits remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-2 or t-3 test cases. The only changes are that the rank and suit variables now hold the values of the rank and suit of the second card in the input().split() respectively, instead of the first card.
