Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains 0 test cases, `trump` is a single character (one of "CDHS"), `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the ranks of all cards in the input().split() with one element removed, `answers` is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to `trump`, with an additional element that is a string containing the rank and suit of the current card, followed by the popped rank from `trumps` and the `trump` suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least 3 values are None, `suit` is 'H'. If `rank` is `None`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of the variables.***
