Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is an empty list, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, suit is 'S', trumps is an empty list sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a non-empty list, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, suit is 'S', and this is printed: "[the second last rank from trumps][trump] [the last rank from trumps][trump]"
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list with at least 1 element, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, suit is 'S', and this is printed: "[popped rank from trumps][trump] [popped rank from trumps][trump]"
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list with at least 2 elements, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, with additional elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, followed by the popped rank from trumps and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, suit is 'S', and this is printed: "[popped rank from trumps][trump] [popped rank from trumps][trump]"


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
