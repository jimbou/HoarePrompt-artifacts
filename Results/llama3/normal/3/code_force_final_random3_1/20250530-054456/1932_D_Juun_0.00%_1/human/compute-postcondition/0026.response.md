Output State: **stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the ranks of all cards in the input().split() if the suit of any card is equal to trump, answers is a list with elements that are strings containing the rank and suit of each card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the card is not equal to trump, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the stdin contains no more test cases, the trump variable still holds a single character (one of "CDHS"), the trumps list contains the ranks of all cards that have a suit equal to the trump suit, the answers list contains strings representing each card, with the rank and suit separated by a space and sorted alphabetically if the suit is not the trump suit, and the suits dictionary has all values set to None.
