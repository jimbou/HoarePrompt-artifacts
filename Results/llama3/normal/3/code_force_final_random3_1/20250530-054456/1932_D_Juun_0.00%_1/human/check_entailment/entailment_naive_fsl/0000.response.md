Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when there are multiple cards of the same suit but different ranks. In this case, the program will not be able to correctly pair the cards in the order they were played.

For example, if the input is:

3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

The program will output:

3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S

However, this is not a correct solution because the 3S and 7S cards were not played in the correct order. The correct solution would be:

3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S

But the program does not guarantee this order.

Another example is:

2
C
3S 5D 9S 6H

The program will output:

IMPOSSIBLE

However, this is not correct. A correct solution would be:

3S 9S
5D 6H

But the program does not find this solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
