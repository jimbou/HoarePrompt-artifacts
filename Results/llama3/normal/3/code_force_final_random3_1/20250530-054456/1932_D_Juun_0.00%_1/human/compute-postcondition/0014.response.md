Output State: **stdin contains t-2 or t-3 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise it is an empty list with an additional element which is the rank of the second card, answers is a list with an additional element that is a string containing the rank and suit of the first card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump, otherwise it is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key suit set to None if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise the value of suits[suit] is rank.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list trumps now contains an additional element which is the rank of the second card, if the suit of the first card is equal to trump. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
