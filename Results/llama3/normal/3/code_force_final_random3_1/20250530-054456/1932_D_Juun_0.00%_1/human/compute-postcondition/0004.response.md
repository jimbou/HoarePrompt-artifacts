Output State: **stdin contains t-2 test cases, trump is a single character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split(), answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, rank is the rank of the first card in the input().split(), the current value of suit is the suit of the first card in the input().split() and it is equal to the current value of trump.**

In this output state, the list `trumps` now contains the rank of the first card in the input, which was previously not present in the list. The other variables remain unchanged, with `stdin` still containing `t-2` test cases, `trump` being a single character (one of "CDHS"), `answers` being an empty list, `suits` being a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values being `None`, `rank` being the rank of the first card in the input().split(), and the current value of `suit` being the suit of the first card in the input().split() and equal to the current value of `trump`.
