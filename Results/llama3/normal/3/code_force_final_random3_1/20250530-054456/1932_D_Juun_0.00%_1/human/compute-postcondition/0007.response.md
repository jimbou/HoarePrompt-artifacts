In this output state, the list `answers` has been appended with a new string element that contains the rank and suit of the first card, separated by a space, and sorted alphabetically. The dictionary `suits` has been updated to set the value of the key `suit` to `None`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1. The values of `trump`, `trumps`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged.
