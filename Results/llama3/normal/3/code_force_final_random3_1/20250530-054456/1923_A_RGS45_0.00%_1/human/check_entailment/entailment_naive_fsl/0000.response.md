Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It first finds the index of the first '1' (representing a chip) from the left and the index of the first '1' from the right (after reversing the string). This effectively gives the range of the block of chips. Then, it counts the number of '0's (representing free cells) within this range, which is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the chips are already in a single block (in which case the count of '0's within the range will be 0), and cases where there are multiple free cells between the chips. The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one chip, in which case the count of '0's will be 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
