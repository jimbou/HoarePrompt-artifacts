The code prints the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z.
The substring z is a substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1.
The index x is the index of the first '1' in arr, and the index y is the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr.
The number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z is being printed.
Output: **the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z (where z is a substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1)**
