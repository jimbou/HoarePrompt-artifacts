Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the input, arr is a string equal to the input, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1, stdin is empty, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z is being printed**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `arr`. The third line assigns the index of the first '1' in `arr` to `x`. The fourth line assigns the index of the first '1' in the reverse of `arr` to `y`. The fifth line assigns the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` to `z`. The number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` is being printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
