Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains 2*t lines. The first line of each t lines contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 50). Each of the following t lines contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) separated by spaces. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip (a_i = 1).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = str(input(''))
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1, stdin is empty, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the input, arr is a string equal to the input, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1, stdin is empty, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z is being printed, the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the input, arr is a string equal to the input, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1, stdin is empty, the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z has been printed, and the number of '0's in the substring z is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
