Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the input for the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string of binary digits `arr`.
3. It finds the first occurrence of '1' in the string using `arr.find('1')`, which gives the starting index of the first chip.
4. It finds the last occurrence of '1' in the string by reversing the string and using `arr[::-1].find('1')`, which gives the ending index of the last chip.
5. It extracts the substring between the starting and ending indices of the chips using `arr[x:n - y]`.
6. It counts the number of zeros in this substring using `z.count('0')`, which gives the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when all chips are already in a single block (in which case the output is 0). The execution summary also confirms that the program processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.

Correctness: **True**
