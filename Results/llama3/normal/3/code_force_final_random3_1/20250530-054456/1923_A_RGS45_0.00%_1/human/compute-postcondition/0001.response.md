To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), we can confirm that `t` is indeed greater than 0.

However, to make the loop execute, we also need to consider the state of the stdin, which contains 2*t lines. But since stdin is not in the loop head, we cannot adjust its state.

So, the only adjustment we can make is to `t`, which is already given to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0**
