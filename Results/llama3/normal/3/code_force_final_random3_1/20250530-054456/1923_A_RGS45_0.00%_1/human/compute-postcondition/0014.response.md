Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the number of zeros in a specific substring for each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines containing an integer n and a string of n binary digits. For each test case, it finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string, extracts the substring between these indices, and prints the count of zeros in this substring. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.**
