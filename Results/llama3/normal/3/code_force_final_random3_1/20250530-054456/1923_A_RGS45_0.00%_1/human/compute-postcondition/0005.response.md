The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is a substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n` - `y` - 1, `stdin` is empty, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` is being printed**
