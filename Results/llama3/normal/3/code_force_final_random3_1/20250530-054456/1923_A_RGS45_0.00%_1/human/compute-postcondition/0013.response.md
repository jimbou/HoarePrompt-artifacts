Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer equal to the input, arr is a string equal to the input, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1, stdin is empty, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z has been printed for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z has been printed for each test case. The values of t, n, arr, x, y, and z are as described above, and stdin is empty.
