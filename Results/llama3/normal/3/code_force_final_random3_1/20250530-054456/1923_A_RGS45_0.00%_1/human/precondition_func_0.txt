stdin contains t+2*t lines. The first line contains one integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). Each of the following t lines contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 50). Each of the following t lines contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) separated by spaces. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip (a_i = 1).
