Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains 2*t lines. The first line of each t lines contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 50). Each of the following t lines contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) separated by spaces. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip (a_i = 1).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains 2*t lines, where the first line of each t lines contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and each of the following t lines contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) separated by spaces. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip (a_i = 1).
