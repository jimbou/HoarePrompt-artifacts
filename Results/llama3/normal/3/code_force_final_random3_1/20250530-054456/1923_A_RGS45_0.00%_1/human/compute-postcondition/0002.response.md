Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is an integer input by the user, and the value of `arr` is a string input by the user. The value of `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, and the value of `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reverse of `arr`. The value of `z` is a substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`. The stdin is empty as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
