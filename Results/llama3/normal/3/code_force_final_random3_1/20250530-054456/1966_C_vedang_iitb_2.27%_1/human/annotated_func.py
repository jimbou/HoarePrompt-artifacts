    #State: `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `a_new` is a sorted list of unique non-negative integers from `a` that must have at least `len(a_new)` elements, where each element is reduced by the previous element, `a_temp` is a copy of `a_new`, `i` is `len(a_new) - 1`
    return a_new
    #The program returns a sorted list of unique non-negative integers from list `a` that must have at least `len(a_new)` elements, where each element is reduced by the previous element.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list in ascending order, and then subtracts each element from the previous one, returning the resulting list. The returned list contains unique non-negative integers from the original list, with each element reduced by the previous element, and has at least the same number of elements as the original list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers and n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the length of list a.
    if (n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the number 1

        if (n == 2) :
            if (a[0] % 2 == 0) :
                return 1
                #The program returns the number 1
            else :
                return 2
                #The program returns the integer 2.
        else :
            winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
            if (winNext == 2 or winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1) :
                return 1
                #The program returns 1
            else :
                return 2
                #The program returns the integer 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winning move for a game involving a list of positive integers and its length, returning 1 if the current player can win and 2 otherwise.
