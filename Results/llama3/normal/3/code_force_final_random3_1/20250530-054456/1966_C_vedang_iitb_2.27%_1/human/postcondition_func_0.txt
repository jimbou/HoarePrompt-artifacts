This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list in ascending order, and then subtracts each element from the previous one, returning the resulting list. The returned list contains unique non-negative integers from the original list, with each element reduced by the previous element, and has at least the same number of elements as the original list.
