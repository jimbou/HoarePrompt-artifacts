Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game.

In the function `func_2`, the base case for `n == 1` is incorrect. If there is only one pile, the player who goes first will always win, regardless of the size of the pile. Therefore, the function should return 1 in this case, not 2.

Additionally, the recursive case in `func_2` is also incorrect. The function is trying to determine the winner of the game by recursively calling itself with the remaining piles, but it is not considering the fact that the players can remove stones from each nonempty pile at once.

A correct solution would involve using a different approach, such as using bitwise operations to determine the winner of the game.

Here is an example of a correct solution:

```python
def stoneGame(piles):
    n = len(piles)
    xor = 0
    for pile in piles:
        xor ^= pile
    if xor == 0:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Alice"
```

This solution works by calculating the bitwise XOR of all the piles. If the result is 0, it means that the total number of stones in the piles is even, and therefore Bob will win. Otherwise, Alice will win.
