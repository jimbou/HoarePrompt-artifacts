Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of positive integers and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of list `a`. `n` is larger than 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. `winNext` is not equal to 2 and if `winNext` is 1, then `a[0]` is equal to 1***
