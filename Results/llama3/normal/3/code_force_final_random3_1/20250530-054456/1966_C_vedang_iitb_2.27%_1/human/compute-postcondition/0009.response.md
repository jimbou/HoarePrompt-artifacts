Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of list `a`. `n` is larger than 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `winNext` is determined by the function `func_2` called with the arguments `a[1:]` (which is the list `a` without its first element) and `n - 1`. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, and the relationship between `n` and the length of `a` is still valid.
