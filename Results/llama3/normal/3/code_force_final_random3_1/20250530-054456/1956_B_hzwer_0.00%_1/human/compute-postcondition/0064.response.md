Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.***
