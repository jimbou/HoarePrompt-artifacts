Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `-1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If the list `cards` does not contain `j + 1`, then `dp[n - 4][j]` is equal to `dp[n - 3][j]`. If the list `cards` contains `j + 1` exactly once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If the list `cards` contains `j + 1` more than once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `i` remains at `n - 4`, `j` reaches `-1`, and the values in the `dp` 2D list are updated based on the occurrences of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. If `j + 1` is not in `cards`, the value of `dp` at position `[n - 4][j]` is the same as `dp` at position `[n - 3][j]`. If `j + 1` occurs exactly once in `cards`, the value of `dp` at position `[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp` at position `[i + 1][j]` and `dp` at position `[i + 2][j - 1]` plus 1. If `j + 1` occurs more than once in `cards`, the value of `dp` at position `[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp` at position `[i + 1][j]`, `dp` at position `[i + 2][j - 1]` plus 1, and `dp` at position `[i + 1][j + 1]`.
