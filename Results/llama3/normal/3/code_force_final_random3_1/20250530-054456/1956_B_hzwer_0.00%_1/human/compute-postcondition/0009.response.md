Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1], j is n - 1, and cards contains at least one occurrence of j + 1, and cards contains more than one occurrence of j + 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of three values: the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`, the value of `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` plus 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
