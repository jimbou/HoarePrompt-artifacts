Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, j is n - 1. The current value of j + 1 is not present in the list of cards.***
