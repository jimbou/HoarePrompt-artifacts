#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains one input: a positive integer (the number of test cases). Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains one input: a positive integer (the number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game). The second line of each test case contains a space-separated list of positive integers (the integers on the cards in your hand). The length of the list is equal to the number of cards you receive in the beginning of the game. Each integer in the list is less than or equal to the number of cards you receive in the beginning of the game. Each integer from 1 through the number of cards you receive in the beginning of the game appears in the list at most 2 times.
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: n is at least 1, i is -1, j is -1, cards is a list of positive integers, and dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). For all i and j where 0 <= i <= n - 1 and 0 <= j <= n - 1, if j + 1 is not in cards, then dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i + 1][j]. If cards contains j + 1 exactly once, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. If cards contains j + 1 more than once, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the value of dp[0][0], which is the maximum value that can be obtained from the 2D list dp, considering the conditions based on the presence of j + 1 in the list cards.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the maximum value that can be obtained from a 2D list dp, based on the presence of integers in a list of cards. It takes no explicit parameters but reads input from stdin, including the number of test cases, the number of cards, and the integers on the cards. The function returns the maximum value that can be obtained, considering the conditions based on the presence of integers in the list of cards.
