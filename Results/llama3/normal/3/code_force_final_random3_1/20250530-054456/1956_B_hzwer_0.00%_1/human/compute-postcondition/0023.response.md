Postcondition: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). If `j + 1` does not appear in cards, then dp[n - 3][n - 3] is 0. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in cards, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. If `j + 1` appears more than once in cards, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].**
