Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1), dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1]**.

In this output state, the value of dp[i][j] has been updated to be the maximum of three possible values: dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1]. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of dp[i][j] is now determined by the maximum of these three values, which takes into account the presence of j + 1 in the cards list.
