Postcondition: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` is present in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and if `j + 1` appears at least twice in `cards`, also `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
