Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If the list `cards` does not contain `j + 1`, then `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[n - 3][n - 1]`. If the list `cards` contains `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `j + 1` occurs exactly once in `cards`, otherwise `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.***
