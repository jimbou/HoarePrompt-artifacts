Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. The current value of `j` is `n - 1`, and the number `j + 1` is not present in the list `cards`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `cards` still does not contain the number `j + 1`, and `j` is still equal to `n - 1`. The 2D list `dp` has been modified at the position `[i][j]`, but its overall size and structure remain the same.
