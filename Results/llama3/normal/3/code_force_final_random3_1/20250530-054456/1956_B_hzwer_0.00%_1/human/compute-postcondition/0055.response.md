Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers containing exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of two values: the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` and the value of `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` plus 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The 2D list `dp` has been modified only at the position `[i][j]`.
