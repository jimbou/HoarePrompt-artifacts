To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already at least 4, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust `j` to be `n - 1` to ensure the loop can start.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`**
