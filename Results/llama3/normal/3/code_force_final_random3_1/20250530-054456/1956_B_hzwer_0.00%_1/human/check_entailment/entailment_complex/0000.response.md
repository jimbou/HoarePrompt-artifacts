Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The program initializes a 2D list dp of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) and fills it up based on the presence of integers in the list of cards. The program then returns the value of dp[0][0], which represents the maximum number of points that can be obtained.

The program correctly handles the base cases where the integer j + 1 is not in the list of cards, is in the list exactly once, or is in the list more than once. The program also correctly calculates the maximum value that can be obtained based on these cases.

The time complexity of the program is O(n^2), which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem. The space complexity is also O(n^2), which is acceptable.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
