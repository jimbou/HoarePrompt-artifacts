Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `j + 1` is not in `cards`, then `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is equal to `dp[n - 4][n - 3]`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][n - 3]` and `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1`. If `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.***
