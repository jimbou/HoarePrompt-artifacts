To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`, which means that `j` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`**
