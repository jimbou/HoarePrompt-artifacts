Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `-1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. For all `i` and `j` where `0 <= i <= n - 5` and `0 <= j <= n - 1`, if `j + 1` is not in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` exactly once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` more than once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `-1`, updating the values in the `dp` 2D list based on the presence of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, the value of `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` is present exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. This process continues until `j` reaches `-1`, at which point the loop terminates. The final state of the `dp` list reflects the maximum values that can be obtained based on the presence of elements in the `cards` list.
