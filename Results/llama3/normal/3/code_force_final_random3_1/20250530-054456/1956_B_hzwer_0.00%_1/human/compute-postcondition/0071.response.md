Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `j + 1` is not in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` exactly once, then `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][n - 3]` and `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` more than once, then `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 4][n - 2]`.***
