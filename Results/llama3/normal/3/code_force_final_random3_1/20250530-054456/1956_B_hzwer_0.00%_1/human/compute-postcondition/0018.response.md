The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). If `j + 1` does not appear in cards, then dp[n - 3][n - 3] is 0. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in cards, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. If `j + 1` appears more than once in cards, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1]**
