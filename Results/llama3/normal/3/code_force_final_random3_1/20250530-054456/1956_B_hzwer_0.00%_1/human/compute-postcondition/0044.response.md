The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The value of `i` is `n - 5` and the value of `j` is `n - 3`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is at least 5. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][n - 3]` and `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][n - 3]` and `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1**
