Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i + 1][j], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, j is n - 1. The current value of j + 1 is not present in the list of cards.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, where `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 1`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
