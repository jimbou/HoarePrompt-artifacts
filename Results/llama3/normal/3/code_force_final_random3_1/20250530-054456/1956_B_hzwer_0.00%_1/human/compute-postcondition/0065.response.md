Postcondition: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `j + 1` is not in `cards`, then `dp[n - 5][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[n - 4][n - 2]`. If `cards` contains `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `j + 1` occurs exactly once in `cards`. If `j + 1` occurs more than once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
