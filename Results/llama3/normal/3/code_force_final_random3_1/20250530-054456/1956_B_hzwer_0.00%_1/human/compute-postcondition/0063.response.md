Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, but the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of three possible values: the value of `dp` at the next row and same column (`dp[i + 1][j]`), the value of `dp` at the next two rows and previous column plus one (`dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`), and the value of `dp` at the next row and next column (`dp[i + 1][j + 1]`).
