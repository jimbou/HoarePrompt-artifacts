Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers containing at least two occurrences of `j + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 4, and the values of `i` and `j` are still dependent on `n`. The list `cards` still contains at least two occurrences of `j + 1`. The 2D list `dp` still has the same size, but the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
