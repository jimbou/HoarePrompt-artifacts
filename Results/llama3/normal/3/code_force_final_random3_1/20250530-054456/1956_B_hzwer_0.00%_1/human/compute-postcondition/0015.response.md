Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 4, `i` is still `n - 3`, `j` is still `n - 2`, the list of cards remains the same, and the 2D list `dp` has been updated such that `dp[i][j]` now holds the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
