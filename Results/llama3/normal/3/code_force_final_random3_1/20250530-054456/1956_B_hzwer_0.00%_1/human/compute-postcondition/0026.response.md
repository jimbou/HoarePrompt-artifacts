According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `j`. If `n` is at least 4 and `j` is at least 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4 and `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `-1`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). So for the loop to be executed `n` is at least 4 and `j` is `n - 1`.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1)**
