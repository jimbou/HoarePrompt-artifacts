Output State: **n is a positive integer, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases minus one. The `cards` variable is a list of positive integers, which represents the integers on the cards in your hand for the current test case. The `dp` variable is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, where all elements are initialized to 0 except for `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]`, which are both 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been processed.
