Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`**.

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated based on the maximum of two values: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The other variables, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `cards`, remain unchanged. The 2D list `dp` still has the same size, but the value at the position `[i][j]` has been updated.
