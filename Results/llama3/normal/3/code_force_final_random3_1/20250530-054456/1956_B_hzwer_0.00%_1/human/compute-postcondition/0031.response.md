Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. The list cards contains exactly one occurrence of the value `j + 1`**

In this output state, the value of dp[i][j] has been updated to be the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list cards still contains exactly one occurrence of the value j + 1.
