To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 4, the loop can execute because the range starts from `n - 3` and goes down to `-1`. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 4. The variable `i` will start at `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
