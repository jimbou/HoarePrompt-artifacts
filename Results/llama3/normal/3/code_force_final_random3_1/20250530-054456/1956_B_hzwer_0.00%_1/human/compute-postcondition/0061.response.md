The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. The value of `i` is `n - 5` and the value of `j` is `n - 2`. The value of `n` is at least 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `dp[n - 5][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[n - 4][n - 2]`.**
