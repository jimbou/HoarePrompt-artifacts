Output State: **n is at least 1, i is -1, j is -1, cards is a list of positive integers, and dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). For all i and j where 0 <= i <= n - 1 and 0 <= j <= n - 1, if j + 1 is not in cards, then dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i + 1][j]. If cards contains j + 1 exactly once, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. If cards contains j + 1 more than once, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all possible values of `i` and `j` from `n - 3` to `-1`, and has updated the `dp` table accordingly. The final state of the `dp` table is such that for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it contains the maximum value that can be obtained by either not using the card `j + 1` (in which case `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`), or by using the card `j + 1` exactly once (in which case `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`), or by using the card `j + 1` more than once (in which case `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`).
