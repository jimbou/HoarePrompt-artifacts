Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and all other elements are the same as before, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of dp[i][j] has been updated to be the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as before. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
