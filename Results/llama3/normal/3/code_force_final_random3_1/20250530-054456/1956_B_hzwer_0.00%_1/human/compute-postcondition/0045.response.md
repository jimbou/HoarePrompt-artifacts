Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 5, `i` is still `n - 5`, and `j` is still `n - 3`. The list of positive integers `cards` remains unchanged. The 2D list `dp` has been updated such that the value at position `[i][j]` is now the maximum of the values at positions `[i + 1][j]`, `[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `[i + 1][j + 1]`.
