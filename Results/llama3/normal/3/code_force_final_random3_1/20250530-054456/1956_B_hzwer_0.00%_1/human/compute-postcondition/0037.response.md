Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `cards` and the 2D list `dp` are still present, but their contents have not been modified by the given code. The relationship between `i`, `j`, and `n` is still maintained, with `i` being `n - 4` and `j` being `n - 2`.
