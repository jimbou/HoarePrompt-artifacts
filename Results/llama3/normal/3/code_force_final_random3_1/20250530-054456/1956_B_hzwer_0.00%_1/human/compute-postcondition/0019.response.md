Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). If `j + 1` does not appear in cards, then dp[n - 3][n - 3] is 0. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in cards, then dp[i][j] is dp[i + 1][j]. If `j + 1` appears more than once in cards, then dp[i][j] is dp[i + 1][j]**.

In this output state, the value of dp[i][j] has been updated to dp[i + 1][j], regardless of how many times `j + 1` appears in cards. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
