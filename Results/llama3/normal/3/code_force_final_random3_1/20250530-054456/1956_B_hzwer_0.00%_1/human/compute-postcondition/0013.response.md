Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0 and dp[n - 3][n - 2] which is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of dp[i][j] has been updated to be equal to dp[i + 1][j], which is dp[n - 2][n - 2]. Since dp[n - 2][0] is 0, dp[n - 2][n - 2] is also 0. Therefore, dp[n - 3][n - 2] is 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
