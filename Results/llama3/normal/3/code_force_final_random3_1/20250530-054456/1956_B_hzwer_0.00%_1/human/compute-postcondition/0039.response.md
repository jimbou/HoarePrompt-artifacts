Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition "If the list `cards` does not contain `j + 1`, then `dp[n - 4][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[n - 3][n - 2]`" is no longer relevant because the code has updated `dp[i][j]` regardless of whether `cards` contains `j + 1` or not.
