Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `-1`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). If `j + 1` does not appear in cards, then dp[n - 3][n - 3] is 0. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in cards, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. If `j + 1` appears more than once in cards, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all values of `j` from `n - 1` to `-1`, and the values of `dp[i][j]` have been updated accordingly based on the presence of `j + 1` in the list of cards. The values of `n`, `i`, and `cards` remain unchanged, and the 2D list `dp` has been updated with the maximum values for each `j`.
