Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, j is n - 1, and cards contains at least one occurrence of j + 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If cards contains exactly one occurrence of j + 1, dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. If cards contains more than one occurrence of j + 1, dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].***
