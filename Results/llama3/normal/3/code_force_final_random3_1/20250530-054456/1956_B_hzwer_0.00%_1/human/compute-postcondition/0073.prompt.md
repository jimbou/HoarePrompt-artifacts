Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
        elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `-1`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). If `j + 1` does not appear in cards, then dp[n - 3][n - 3] is 0. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in cards, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. If `j + 1` appears more than once in cards, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `-1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If the list `cards` does not contain `j + 1`, then `dp[n - 4][j]` is equal to `dp[n - 3][j]`. If the list `cards` contains `j + 1` exactly once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If the list `cards` contains `j + 1` more than once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `-1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. For all `i` and `j` where `0 <= i <= n - 5` and `0 <= j <= n - 1`, if `j + 1` is not in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` exactly once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` more than once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
