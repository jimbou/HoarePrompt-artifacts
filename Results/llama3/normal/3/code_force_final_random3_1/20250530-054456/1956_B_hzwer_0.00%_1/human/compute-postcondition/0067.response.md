Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The 2D list `dp` has been updated such that the value at position `[i][j]` is now equal to the value at position `[i + 1][j]`. This means that the value at position `[i][j]` has been overwritten with the value from the next row in the same column.
