Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `-1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` is present in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and if `j + 1` appears at least twice in `cards`, also `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `j + 1` is not in `cards`, then `dp[n - 5][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[n - 4][n - 2]`. If `cards` contains `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `j + 1` occurs exactly once in `cards`. If `j + 1` occurs more than once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `j + 1` is not in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` exactly once, then `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][n - 3]` and `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` more than once, then `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 4][n - 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
