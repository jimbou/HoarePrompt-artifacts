The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again `j` must be `n - 3` and `n` must be at least 5.
State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`**
