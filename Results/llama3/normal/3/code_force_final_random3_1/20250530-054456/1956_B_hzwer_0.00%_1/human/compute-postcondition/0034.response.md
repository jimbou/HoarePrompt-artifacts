Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`, cards is a list of positive integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1). If the list cards contains exactly one occurrence of the value `j + 1`, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. Otherwise, dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].***
