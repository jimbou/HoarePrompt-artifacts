The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. 

Since `i` is `n - 5` and `j` is `n - 3`, we can substitute these values into the expression. 

`dp[i][j]` becomes `dp[n - 5][n - 3]`. 

The three values being compared are: 

1. `dp[i + 1][j]` which is `dp[n - 5 + 1][n - 3]` or `dp[n - 4][n - 3]`
2. `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` which is `dp[n - 5 + 2][n - 3 - 1] + 1` or `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1`
3. `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` which is `dp[n - 5 + 1][n - 3 + 1]` or `dp[n - 4][n - 2]`

The value of `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum of these three values.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[n - 5][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 3][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 4][n - 2]`.**
