Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains one input: a positive integer (the number of test cases). Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains one input: a positive integer (the number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game). The second line of each test case contains a space-separated list of positive integers (the integers on the cards in your hand). The length of the list is equal to the number of cards you receive in the beginning of the game. Each integer in the list is less than or equal to the number of cards you receive in the beginning of the game. Each integer from 1 through the number of cards you receive in the beginning of the game appears in the list at most 2 times.**
