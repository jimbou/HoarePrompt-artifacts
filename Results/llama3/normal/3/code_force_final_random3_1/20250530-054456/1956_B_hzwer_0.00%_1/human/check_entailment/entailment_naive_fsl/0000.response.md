Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem described. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program initializes a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)`, where `n` is the number of cards. The array is used to store the maximum number of points that can be scored for each possible state of the game.

2. The program then fills up the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner. For each state `(i, j)`, it calculates the maximum number of points that can be scored by considering the following possibilities:
   - If the current card is not present in the player's hand, the maximum number of points is the same as the maximum number of points for the next state `(i+1, j)`.
   - If the current card is present in the player's hand only once, the maximum number of points is the maximum of the maximum number of points for the next state `(i+1, j)` and the maximum number of points for the state `(i+2, j-1)` plus 1 (because the player can score a point by playing the current card).
   - If the current card is present in the player's hand twice, the maximum number of points is the maximum of the maximum number of points for the next state `(i+1, j)`, the maximum number of points for the state `(i+2, j-1)` plus 1, and the maximum number of points for the state `(i+1, j+1)` (because the player can score a point by playing the current card and then playing the other copy of the current card).

3. Finally, the program returns the maximum number of points that can be scored for the initial state `(0, 0)`, which is stored in `dp[0][0]`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, and it uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximum number of points that can be scored. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
