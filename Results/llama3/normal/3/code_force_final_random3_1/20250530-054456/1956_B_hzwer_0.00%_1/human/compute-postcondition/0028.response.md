The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Since `i` is `n - 4` and `j` is `n - 1`, the value of `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is updated to be equal to `dp[n - 4 + 1][n - 1]`, which is `dp[n - 3][n - 1]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `cards` still does not contain the value `j + 1`, which is `n`. The size of the 2D list `dp` is still `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[n - 3][n - 1]`, `cards` is a list of positive integers that does not contain `n`, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.**
