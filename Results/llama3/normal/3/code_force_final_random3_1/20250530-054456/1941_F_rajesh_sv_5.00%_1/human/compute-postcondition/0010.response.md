To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 (since the loop starts from 1), and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 (since the list `A` has `n` distinct non-negative integers).

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers. If the difference between the first two elements of A is greater than max_diff, then max_diff is updated to this difference and index is set to 1. Otherwise, max_diff remains -inf, next_max_diff is either -inf or the difference between the first two elements of A, and index is None, i is 2, n must be greater than 2**
