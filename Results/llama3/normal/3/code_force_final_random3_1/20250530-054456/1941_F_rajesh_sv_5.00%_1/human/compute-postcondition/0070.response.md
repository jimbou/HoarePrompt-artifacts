The only variable in the loop head is variable  f, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list F.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, f is the first element in the list, so for the loop to be executed one more time f must be the second element in the list.
State: **`l` is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, `h` is equal to `l`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the second element in the list F, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f`.**
