Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of at least 1 non-negative integers, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A` excluding the maximum difference, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the element before the maximum difference in `A`, `right` is the element after the maximum difference in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A`, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, and `mid_next_sum` is the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `l` and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.
