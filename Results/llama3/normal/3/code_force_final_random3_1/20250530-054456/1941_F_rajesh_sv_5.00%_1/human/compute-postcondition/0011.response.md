Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is the difference between the second and third elements of `A`, If the difference between the first two elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference and `index` is set to 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is either -inf or the difference between the first two elements of `A`, and `index` is None, `n` must be greater than 2**

In this output state, the value of `diff` has been updated to the difference between the second and third elements of `A`, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The value of `i` is still 2, and the lists `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` are still applicable, and their values depend on the difference between the first two elements of `A`.
