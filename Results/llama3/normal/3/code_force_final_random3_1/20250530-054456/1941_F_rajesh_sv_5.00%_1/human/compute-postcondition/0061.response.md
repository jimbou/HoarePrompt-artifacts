To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` so that `l` is still less than `h`. Given the conditions at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `h` must be greater than `l` by at least 1.

To maintain this condition, we need to ensure that `l` does not exceed `h`. Since `l` is updated to `mid + 1` when `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, we need to make sure that `mid + 1` is still less than `h`.

Similarly, when `h` is updated to `mid`, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `mid`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, h must be greater than l by at least 2, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in the list F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f, mid_next_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f**
