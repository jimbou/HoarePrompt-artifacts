Output State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` that must be greater than 2, and `func_6()` has been executed four times.**

In this output state, the value of `testcases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the execution of `func_6()`. However, the number of times `func_6()` has been executed has increased by one, from three to four.
