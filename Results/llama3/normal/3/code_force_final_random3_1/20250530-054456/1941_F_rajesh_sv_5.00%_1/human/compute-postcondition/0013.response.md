Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is the difference between the second and third elements of `A`, `next_max_diff` is the difference between the second and third elements of `A`, If the difference between the first two elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference and `index` is set to 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, and `index` is None.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `i`, and `diff` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `next_max_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`, which is the difference between the second and third elements of `A`. The values of `max_diff` and `index` are not changed by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
