Output State: **`l` is the average of the previous `l` and `h` plus 1, `h` is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, `f` is the next element in the list F, `mid` is the average of the previous `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is D[mid] + f, `mid_next_sum` is D[mid + 1] + f. The current value of mid_sum minus left is less than the current value of right minus mid_next_sum.**

In natural language, the output state is: The insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order is updated to be the average of the previous insertion point and the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
