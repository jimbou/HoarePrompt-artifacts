The code prints the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`. 

`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Here, `D[l]` is the element at index `l` in the list `D`, `f` is the last element in the list `F`, `left` and `right` are some given values. 

`next_max_diff` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, it seems to be another difference value.

Since the exact values of `D`, `F`, `left`, `right`, and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `max(ans, next_max_diff)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, and next_max_diff is another difference value)**
