Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, max_diff is -inf, next_max_diff is -inf, and index is None.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers. If the difference between the first two elements of A is greater than max_diff, then max_diff is updated to this difference and index is set to 1. Otherwise, max_diff remains -inf, next_max_diff is either -inf or the difference between the first two elements of A, and index is None.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 2. `diff` is the difference between the second and third elements of `A`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 2. Otherwise, if the difference between the first two elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference and `index` is set to 1. If the difference between the second and third elements of `A` is greater than the difference between the first two elements of `A`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to the difference between the second and third elements of `A`. If none of the above conditions are met, `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is either -inf or the difference between the first two elements of `A`, and `index` is None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A` is greater than the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A`, then `max_diff` is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A`, `next_max_diff` is either -inf or the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A` excluding the maximum difference, and `index` is 3. Otherwise, if the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A` is greater than the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A`, then `max_diff` is either -inf or the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A`, `next_max_diff` is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A`, and `index` is either None or the index of the maximum difference in the first three elements of `A`. Otherwise, the values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
