To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `F` and `f` in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `F`. If the list `F` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we only know that `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, but we don't know the value of `k`. So, for the loop to be executed, `F` must have at least 1 element and `f` is the first element in the list `F`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of at least 1 non-negative integers, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A` excluding the maximum difference, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the element before the maximum difference in `A`, `right` is the element after the maximum difference in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A`, and `f` is the first element in the list `F`.**
