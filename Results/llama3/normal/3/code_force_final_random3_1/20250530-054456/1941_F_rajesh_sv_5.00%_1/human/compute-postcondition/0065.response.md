Postcondition: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, h must be greater than l by at least 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in the list F, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f, mid_next_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is mid + 1 and h remains the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, otherwise l remains the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order and h is updated to l + (h - l) // 2.**
