Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, `h` must be greater than `l` by at least 2, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in the list F, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f`**

In natural language, the output state is: The insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order is now `mid + 1`, while the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 remains the same. The minimum value `ans` is still the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The next element `f` in the list F and the middle index `mid` and its corresponding sums `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.
