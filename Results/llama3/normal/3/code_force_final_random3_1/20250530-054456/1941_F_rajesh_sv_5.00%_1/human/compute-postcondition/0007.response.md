Output State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` that must be greater than or equal to 0, and `func_6()` has been executed `testcases` times.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `testcases` remains the same as the return value of `func_3()`, and `func_6()` has been executed a number of times equal to the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is 0, the loop does not execute at all, and `func_6()` is not executed. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop executes that many times, and `func_6()` is executed the same number of times.
