Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A` is greater than the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A`, then `max_diff` is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A`, `next_max_diff` is either -inf or the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A` excluding the maximum difference, and `index` is 3. Otherwise, if the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A` is greater than the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A`, then `max_diff` is either -inf or the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A`, `next_max_diff` is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A`, and `index` is either None or the index of the maximum difference in the first three elements of `A`. Otherwise, the values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged.***
