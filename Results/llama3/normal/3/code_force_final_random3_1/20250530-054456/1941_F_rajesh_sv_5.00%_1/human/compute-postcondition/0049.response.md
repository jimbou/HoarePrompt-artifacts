To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to examine the condition `l < h`. Given the initial states:

* `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order
* `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1

For the loop to execute the first time, `l` must be less than `h`. Since `h` is defined as the insertion point for `right - f` minus 1, and `l` is defined as the insertion point for `left - f`, we need to ensure that the insertion point for `left - f` is less than the insertion point for `right - f` minus 1.

This implies that `left - f` must be less than `right - f` to ensure that their insertion points in a sorted list `D` maintain the required order. However, since `f` is the same in both cases, we can simplify this to ensuring that `left` is less than `right`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `ans` or `f`, as they do not affect the loop condition. The state of `l` and `h` inherently depends on the relationship between `left`, `right`, and `f`, which is already defined. Thus, the only adjustment needed is conceptual, ensuring that `left` is less than `right` for the loop to potentially execute, but this does not change the state description directly since it's about the relationship between `left` and `right` rather than the values of `l` and `h` themselves.

State: **`l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in the list `F`**
