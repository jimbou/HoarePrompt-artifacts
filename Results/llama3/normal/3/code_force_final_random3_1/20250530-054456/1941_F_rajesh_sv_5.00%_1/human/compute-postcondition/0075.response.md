Output State: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order and is strictly less than h, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the second element in the list F, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f, mid_next_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f, l is now mid + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of l has been updated to mid + 1, while the values of other variables remain the same. The current value of mid_sum minus left is still less than right minus mid_next_sum.
