Output State: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, h must be greater than l by at least 2, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in the list F, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f, mid_next_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f**

The code block updates the values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`. The first line recalculates `mid` as the average of `l` and `h`, which is `l + (h - l) // 2`. The second line updates `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by adding `f` to the values of `D[mid]` and `D[mid + 1]`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
