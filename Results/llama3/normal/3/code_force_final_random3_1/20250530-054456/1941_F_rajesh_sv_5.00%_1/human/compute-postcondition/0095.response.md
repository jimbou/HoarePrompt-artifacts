Output: **ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the last element in the list F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f, mid_next_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f, and the maximum of ans and next_max_diff is printed**
