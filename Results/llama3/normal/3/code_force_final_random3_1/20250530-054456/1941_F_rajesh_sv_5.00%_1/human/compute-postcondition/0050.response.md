Output State: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in the list F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `h`, and then computes `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by adding `f` to `D[mid]` and `D[mid + 1]`, respectively. The values of `l`, `h`, `ans`, and `f` remain unchanged.
