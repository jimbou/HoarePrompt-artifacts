Functionality: **This function calculates the minimum maximum difference between two consecutive elements in a sorted list A, considering a list of non-negative integers F and a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers D. It first finds the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A and the next maximum difference, excluding the maximum difference. Then, for each element in F, it finds the insertion point in D to maintain sorted order and updates the minimum maximum difference. Finally, it returns the maximum of the minimum maximum difference and the next maximum difference.**
