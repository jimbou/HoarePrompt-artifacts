Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A excluding the maximum difference, and index is the index of the maximum difference in A.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables n, m, and k remain unchanged as positive integers. The lists A, D, and F also remain unchanged. The variable max_diff is updated to the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the list A. The variable next_max_diff is updated to the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, excluding the maximum difference. The variable index is updated to the index of the maximum difference in A.
