Postcondition: ***l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order and is strictly less than h, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the second element in the list F, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f, mid_next_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f, D[mid] + f is mid_sum, D[mid + 1] + f is mid_next_sum. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid.***
