To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l < h`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, and `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h`. Since `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, and `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, we can conclude that `h` must be greater than `l` by at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 and `h` must be greater than `l` by at least 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in the list `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f**
