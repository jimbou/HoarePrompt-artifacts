Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A excluding the maximum difference, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in the list F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f. The current value of mid_sum minus left is less than right minus mid_next_sum***
