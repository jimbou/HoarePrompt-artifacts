The only variable in the loop head is variable `f`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f` and the list `F`. If `f` is not the last element in the list `F`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is equal to `h`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. For the loop to execute again, `f` must be the next element in the list `F`.

State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in the list `F`**
