Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A excluding the maximum difference, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, and ans is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, A, D, F, max_diff, next_max_diff, and index remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces new variables left, right, and ans, which are assigned values based on the existing variables. The variable left is assigned the value of the element before the maximum difference in A, which is A[index - 1]. The variable right is assigned the value of the element after the maximum difference in A, which is A[index]. The variable ans is assigned the value of the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, which is max_diff.
