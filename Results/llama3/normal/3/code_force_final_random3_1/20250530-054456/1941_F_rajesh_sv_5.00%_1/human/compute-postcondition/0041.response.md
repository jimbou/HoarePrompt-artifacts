Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A excluding the maximum difference, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in the list F, l is less than h, mid is the middle index of the range [l, h], mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f, h is the middle index of the range [l, h].**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, except for `h`, which is now equal to `mid`, the middle index of the range `[l, h]`. This means that the upper bound of the range has been updated to be the same as the middle index.
