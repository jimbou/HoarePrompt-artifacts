Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers. If the difference between the first two elements of A is greater than max_diff, then max_diff is updated to this difference and index is set to 1. Otherwise, max_diff remains -inf, next_max_diff is either -inf or the difference between the first two elements of A, and index is None.***
