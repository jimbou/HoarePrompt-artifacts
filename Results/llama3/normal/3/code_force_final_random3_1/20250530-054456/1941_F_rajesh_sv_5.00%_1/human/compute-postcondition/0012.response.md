Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, i is 2, diff is the difference between the second and third elements of A, max_diff is the difference between the second and third elements of A, index is 2, next_max_diff is either -inf or the difference between the first two elements of A.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `i`, `diff`, and `next_max_diff` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The only changes are in the values of `max_diff` and `index`. `max_diff` is now equal to the difference between the second and third elements of `A`, which was previously stored in `diff`. `index` is now set to the value of `i`, which is 2.
