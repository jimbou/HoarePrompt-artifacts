Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of at least 1 non-negative integers, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A` excluding the maximum difference, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the element before the maximum difference in `A`, `right` is the element after the maximum difference in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in `A`, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `mid` is the middle index of the range `[l, h]`, `mid_sum` is the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, `mid_next_sum` is the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`, and `h` is greater than `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be equal to `mid + 1`, and the relationship between `l` and `h` has been updated to `h` being greater than `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
