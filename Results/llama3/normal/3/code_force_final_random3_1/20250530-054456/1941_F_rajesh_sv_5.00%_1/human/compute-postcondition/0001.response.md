According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `testcases`. If `testcases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `testcases` is the return value of `func_3()`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `testcases` is greater than 0.
State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` that must be greater than 0**
