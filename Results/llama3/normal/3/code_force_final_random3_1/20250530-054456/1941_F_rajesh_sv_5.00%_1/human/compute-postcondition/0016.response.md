The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 3. `diff` is the difference between the second and third elements of `A`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 2. Otherwise, if the difference between the first two elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference and `index` is set to 1. If the difference between the second and third elements of `A` is greater than the difference between the first two elements of `A`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to the difference between the second and third elements of `A`. If none of the above conditions are met, `max_diff` remains -inf, `next_max_diff` is either -inf or the difference between the first two elements of `A`, and `index` is None, `n` must be greater than 3**
