Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and `h` is greater than `l`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the second element in the list `F`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f`, `D[mid] + f` is `mid_sum`, `D[mid + 1] + f` is `mid_next_sum`**.

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`, while the values of other variables remain the same. The relationship between `l` and `h` is still maintained, with `h` being greater than `l`. The values of `ans`, `f`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `D[mid] + f`, and `D[mid + 1] + f` are unchanged.
