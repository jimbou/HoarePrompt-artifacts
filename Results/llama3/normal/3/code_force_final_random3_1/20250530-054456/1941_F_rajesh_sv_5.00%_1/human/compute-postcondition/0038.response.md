The variables in the loop head are l and h, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l and h. If l is less than h, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is updated to mid + 1 or h is updated to mid. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of l and h so that l is still less than h.

State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A excluding the maximum difference, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in the list F, l is less than h**
