Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A`, `max_diff` is either -inf or the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in the first three elements of `A`, `next_max_diff` is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A`, and `index` is either None or the index of the maximum difference in the first three elements of `A`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_max_diff` has been updated to be equal to `diff`, which is the difference between the third and fourth elements of `A`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
