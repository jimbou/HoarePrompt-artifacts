Output State: **l is equal to h.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable l is equal to h. This means that the loop has converged to a single value, and the range [l, h] has been narrowed down to a single index. The values of the other variables in the precondition remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
