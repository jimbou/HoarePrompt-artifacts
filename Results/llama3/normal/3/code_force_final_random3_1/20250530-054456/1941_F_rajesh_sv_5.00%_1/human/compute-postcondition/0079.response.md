According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order and is strictly less than `h`, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be strictly less than `h`, so `h` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `l`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order and is strictly less than `h`, `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 and `h` is greater than `l`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the second element in the list `F`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f**
