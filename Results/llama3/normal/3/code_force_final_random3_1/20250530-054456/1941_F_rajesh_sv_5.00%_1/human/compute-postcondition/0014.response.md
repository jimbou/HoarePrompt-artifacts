Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and third elements of `A` is greater than the difference between the first two elements of `A`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to the difference between the second and third elements of `A`. If the difference between the first two elements of `A` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to this difference and `index` is set to 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, and `index` is None.***
