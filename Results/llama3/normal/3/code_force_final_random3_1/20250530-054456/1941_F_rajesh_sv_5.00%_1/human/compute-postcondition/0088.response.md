Postcondition: **l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D, with l being the insertion point for left - f and h being the insertion point for right - f minus 1, and h is greater than l + 1. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid. ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.**
