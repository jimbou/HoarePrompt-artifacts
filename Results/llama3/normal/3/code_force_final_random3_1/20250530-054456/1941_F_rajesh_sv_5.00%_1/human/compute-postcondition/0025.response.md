Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A excluding the maximum difference, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in the list F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, and h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `ans`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces two new variables, `l` and `h`, which are calculated using the `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` functions from the `bisect` module. These functions find the insertion points for `left - f` and `right - f` in the sorted list `D` to maintain sorted order. The value of `l` is the insertion point for `left - f`, and the value of `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` minus one.
