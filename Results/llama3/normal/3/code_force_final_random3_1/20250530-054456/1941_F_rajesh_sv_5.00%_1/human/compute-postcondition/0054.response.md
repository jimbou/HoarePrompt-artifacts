Output State: **`l` is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, `h` is the average of `l` and `h`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in the list F, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`**.

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be the average of `l` and `h`, which is the new insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum` still holds true.
