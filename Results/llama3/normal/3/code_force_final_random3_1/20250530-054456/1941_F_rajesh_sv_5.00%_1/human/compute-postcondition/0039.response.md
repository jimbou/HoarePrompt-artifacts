Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A excluding the maximum difference, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in the list F, l is less than h, mid is the middle index of the range [l, h], mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f.**

In this output state, all the initial variables remain unchanged, and three new variables are introduced: mid, mid_sum, and mid_next_sum. The value of mid is calculated as the middle index of the range [l, h], and mid_sum and mid_next_sum are calculated as the sum of D[mid] and f, and D[mid + 1] and f, respectively.
