Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `k` is increased by 1 plus `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, `i` is 0, stdin contains n-2 lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9). Either (`b` % 3 == 0 or `c` >= 3) or (`b` + `c`) % 3 == 0. If (`b` + `c`) % 3 is not equal to 0, then `k` is increased by 1 plus `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`.***
