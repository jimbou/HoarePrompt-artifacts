Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, stdin contains n-5 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `k` is an integer equal to a + (b + c) // 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been updated to be the sum of `a` and the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain the same. The stdin now contains one less line of input, which is n-5 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c.
