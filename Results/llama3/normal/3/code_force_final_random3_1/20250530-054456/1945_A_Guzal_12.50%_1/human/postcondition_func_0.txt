This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains three integers a, b, and c. It then calculates and prints a value k for each set of a, b, and c, based on certain conditions. If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates k as the sum of a, plus one-third of the sum of b and c, and prints this value. The function repeats this process t times, after which stdin is empty.
