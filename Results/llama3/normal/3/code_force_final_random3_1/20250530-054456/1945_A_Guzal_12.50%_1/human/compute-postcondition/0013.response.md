Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, i is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, k is increased by 1 plus a plus one-third of the sum of b and c, and the value of k is printed.***
