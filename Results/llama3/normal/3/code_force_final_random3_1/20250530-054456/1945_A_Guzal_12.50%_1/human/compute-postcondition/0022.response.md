Output: **n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains n-2 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). If (b + c) % 3 != 0, then k is an integer equal to 3 plus 2a plus two-thirds of the sum of b and c. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to 2 plus 2a plus two-thirds of the sum of b and c, and k is printed**
