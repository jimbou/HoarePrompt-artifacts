Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer equal to 3 plus 2a plus two-thirds of the sum of `b` and `c`, stdin contains `n-2` lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9)**.

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a new value that is 3 plus 2 times the value of `a` plus two-thirds of the sum of `b` and `c`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-2` lines of input, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` within the specified range.
