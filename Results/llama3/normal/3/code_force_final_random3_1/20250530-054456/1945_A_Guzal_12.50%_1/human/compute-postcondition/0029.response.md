Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, stdin contains n-5 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `k` is an integer equal to a + (b + c) // 3 + 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being equal to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
