Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `k` is increased by `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, `i` is 0, stdin contains n-2 lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9). Either (`b` % 3 == 0 or `c` >= 3) or (`b` + `c`) % 3 == 0**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by adding `a` and one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain the same. The stdin now contains one less line of input, as one line has been processed. The condition on `b` and `c` still holds, ensuring that either `b` is a multiple of 3 or `c` is at least 3, or the sum of `b` and `c` is a multiple of 3.
