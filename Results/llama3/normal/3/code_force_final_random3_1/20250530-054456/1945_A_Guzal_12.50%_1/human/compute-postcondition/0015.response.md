Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains n-2 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is an integer equal to 1 plus a plus one-third of the sum of b and c.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the values read from the first line of input. The value of `k` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` read from the first line of input. The stdin now contains `n-2` lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
