The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, i is 1, stdin contains n-1 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, k is increased by 1 plus a plus one-third of the sum of b and c, and the value of k is printed.**
