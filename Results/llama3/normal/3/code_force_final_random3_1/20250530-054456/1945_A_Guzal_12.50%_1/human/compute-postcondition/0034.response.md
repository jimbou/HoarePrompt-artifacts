Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, i is n, stdin is empty. If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, then -1 is printed n times. Otherwise, if (b + c) % 3 != 0, then k is an integer equal to n plus the sum of n instances of a plus one-third of the sum of b and c and k is printed n times. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to n plus the sum of n instances of a plus one-third of the sum of b and c and k is printed n times.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the same as the initial value, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values from the last line of input, `i` will be equal to `n`, and the standard input will be empty. If the condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is true, then `-1` will be printed `n` times. Otherwise, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then the value of `k` will be the sum of `n` instances of `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, and this value will be printed `n` times. If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, then the value of `k` will be the sum of `n` instances of `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, and this value will be printed `n` times.
