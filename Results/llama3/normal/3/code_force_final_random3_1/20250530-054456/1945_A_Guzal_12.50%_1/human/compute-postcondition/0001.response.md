The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n` lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, stdin contains `n` lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), i is 0**
