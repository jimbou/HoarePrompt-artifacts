Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, k is 0, i is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**

The code block reads three integers from the first line of stdin and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. The value of `k` is set to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The remaining `n-1` lines of stdin are left untouched.
