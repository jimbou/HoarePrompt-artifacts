The code `n = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). This integer is assigned to `n`. The remaining lines in stdin still contain t lines with three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n` lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**
