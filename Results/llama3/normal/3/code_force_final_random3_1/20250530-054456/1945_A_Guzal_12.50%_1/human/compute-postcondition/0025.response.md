Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, a is an integer, b is an integer, c is an integer, i is 2, stdin contains n-4 lines of input, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is an integer equal to 0**

The code reads a line of input from stdin, containing three integers a, b, and c, and assigns them to the variables a, b, and c. This reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1. The variable k is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected.
