The code `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Since `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, the count of `x` in `cnt` is now the count of `x` in `a` plus 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is the count of `x` in the list `a` plus 3, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is the third integer in the list.**
