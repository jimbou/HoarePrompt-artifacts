Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is the count of `x` in the list `a` plus 1, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is the first integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to include the count of `x` in the list `a`. The count is incremented by 1 because of the `+ 1` in the code. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `cnt` now contains the key `x` with its corresponding count.
