Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by the integer division of `x` by 4, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least 1 value, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `x` is the first value in the `cnt` dictionary**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the integer division of `x` by 4, where `x` is the first value in the `cnt` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
