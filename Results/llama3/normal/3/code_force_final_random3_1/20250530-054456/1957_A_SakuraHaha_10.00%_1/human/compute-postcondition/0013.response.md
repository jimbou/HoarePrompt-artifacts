Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is increased by `cnt[2] // 4` and `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least 3 values, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `x` is the third value in the `cnt` dictionary**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `x // 4` to its previous value, where `x` is the third value in the `cnt` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `cnt[2] // 4` and `x // 4`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
