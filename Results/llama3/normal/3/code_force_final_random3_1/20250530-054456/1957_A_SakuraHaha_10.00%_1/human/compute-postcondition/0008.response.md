According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cnt dictionary. If the cnt dictionary has at least 1 value, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary with x as a key and its value is the count of x in the list a plus n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x is the nth integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed  the cnt dictionary must have at least 1 value and x is the first value in the cnt dictionary.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least 1 value, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `x` is the first value in the `cnt` dictionary**
