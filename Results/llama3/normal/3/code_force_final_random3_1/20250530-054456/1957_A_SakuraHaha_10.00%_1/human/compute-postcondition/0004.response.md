Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is the count of `x` in the list `a` plus 2, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is the second integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, because `cnt.get(x, 0)` returns the current count of `x` in the dictionary `cnt`, and then 1 is added to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases is still valid.
