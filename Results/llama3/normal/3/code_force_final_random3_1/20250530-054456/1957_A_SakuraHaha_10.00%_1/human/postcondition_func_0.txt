This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the sum of the integer division of the count of each integer in the input by 4. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, only printing the result to stdout. The function processes one test case at a time, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. The function counts the occurrences of each integer, calculates the sum of the integer division of these counts by 4, and prints this sum. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input.
