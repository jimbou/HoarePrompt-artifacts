The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains t test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line consumes the first line of a test case, leaving the second line of the test case and t-1 test cases in stdin. The second line assigns a list of integers from the second line of the test case to `a`. Stdin now contains t-1 test cases. The third line initializes `ans` to 0. The fourth line initializes `cnt` to an empty dictionary.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
