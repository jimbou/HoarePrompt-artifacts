Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary with x as a key and its value is the count of x in the list a plus n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, x is the nth integer in the list**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100, the list `a` remains a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100, the variable `ans` remains 0, the dictionary `cnt` now has keys as the integers in the list `a` and their values are the count of each integer in the list `a` plus `n`, the standard input `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases, and the variable `x` is now the last integer in the list `a`.
