Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

6
2 2 3 3 3 3

The program will output 0, but the correct answer is 1. This is because the program only counts the number of sets of 4 sticks of the same length, but it does not consider the case where there are 3 sticks of the same length, which can form a triangle.

In the given example, the 4 sticks of length 3 can form a square, but the program does not count this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
