Based on the initial state, we know that `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` inputs, and `x` is an integer equal to the first input integer `t`. We also know that `y` is an integer equal to half of the first input integer `t`.

The print statement simply prints the value of `y`. Since `y` is equal to half of the first input integer `t`, we can conclude that the output will be half of the first input integer `t`.

Output: **half of the first input integer t**
