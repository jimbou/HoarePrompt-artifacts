Output State: **i is 1, x is an integer equal to the first input integer t, y is an integer equal to half of the first input integer t, stdin contains t-2 inputs: integers**

In this final state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the first input to `x`, making `x` equal to the first input integer `t`. The second line assigns half of the value of `x` to `y`, making `y` equal to half of the first input integer `t`. Since two inputs have been consumed, stdin now contains `t-2` inputs: integers.
