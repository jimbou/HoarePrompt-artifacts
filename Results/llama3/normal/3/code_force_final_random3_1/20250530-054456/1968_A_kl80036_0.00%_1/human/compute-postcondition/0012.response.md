Output State: **i is t-1, stdin contains 0 inputs: integers, x is an integer equal to the last input integer, y is an integer equal to half of the last input integer, and the value of y which is half of the last input integer is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the loop variable `i` has reached its final value of `t-1`. The input buffer `stdin` is now empty, as all the input integers have been processed. The variable `x` holds the last input integer, and the variable `y` holds half of that integer. The value of `y` is being printed as the final output.
