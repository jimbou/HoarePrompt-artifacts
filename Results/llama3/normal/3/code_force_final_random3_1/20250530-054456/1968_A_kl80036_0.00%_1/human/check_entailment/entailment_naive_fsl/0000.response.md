Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 7, the program outputs 3, but the correct output should be 6 because gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7, which is the maximum possible value.

The program only checks the value of y as x // 2, which is not sufficient to find the maximum possible value of gcd(x, y) + y. The program should check all values of y from 1 to x - 1 to find the maximum possible value.
