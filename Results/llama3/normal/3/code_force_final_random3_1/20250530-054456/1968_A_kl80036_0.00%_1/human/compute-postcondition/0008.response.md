The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of inputs in `stdin`. If `i` is less than the number of inputs in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer equal to the first input integer `t`, `y` is an integer equal to half of the first input integer `t`, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs: integers, and `y` is printed, `y` is equal to half of the first input integer `t`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `stdin` must contain at least `t-1` inputs: integers.
State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer equal to the first input integer `t`, `y` is an integer equal to half of the first input integer `t`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: integers, and `y` is printed, `y` is equal to half of the first input integer `t`**
