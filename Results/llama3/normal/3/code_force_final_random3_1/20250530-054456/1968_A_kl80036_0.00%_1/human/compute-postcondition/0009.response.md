Output State: **i is 2, x is an integer equal to the first input integer t, y is an integer equal to half of the first input integer t, stdin contains t-2 inputs: integers, and y is printed**

The code snippet first assigns the value of the first input integer `t` to `x`. Since `x` was previously equal to `t`, this line does not change the value of `x`. The second line assigns the value of `x // 2` to `y`. Since `x` is equal to `t`, `y` becomes half of `t`. The value of `i` is not affected by the code. The `stdin` now contains `t-2` inputs: integers, since two inputs have been consumed by the code. The value of `y` is printed, but this does not change its value.
