The only variables in the loop head are variable i and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and the input. If i is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 0, the input contains t inputs: integers x, x is an integer equal to the first input integer t, y is an integer equal to half of the first input integer t, and the value of y which is half of the first input integer t is being printed. So for the loop to execute again i is increased by 1 so i is 1 and for the loop to execute again the input must contain t-1 inputs: integers x.
State: **i is 1, stdin contains t-1 inputs: integers x, x is an integer equal to the first input integer t, y is an integer equal to half of the first input integer t**
