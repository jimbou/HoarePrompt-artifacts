Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement requires finding the number of players declared as winners for each query `n_i` given the sequence `a`. The program correctly implements this by calling `func_1` for each query `n_i` and appending the result to the `res` list.

2. `func_1` correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the game until no more players can be removed. It does this by subtracting the count of players that can be removed in each round from the total number of players `n`. The count of players that can be removed is calculated by summing up the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.

3. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than the minimum value in `p` by returning `n` immediately, since no players can be removed in this case.

4. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is equal to the minimum value in `p` by removing all players in the first round and returning 0.

5. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than the minimum value in `p` by repeatedly removing players until no more players can be removed.

6. The program correctly prints the results for each query `n_i` by joining the `res` list into a string with spaces in between.

Correctness: **True**
