The code prints a string containing the results of the function `func_1(n, p)` separated by spaces. The value of `n` is the first element in the list `qs`, and `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`. Since the exact values of `n`, `p`, and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the results. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the results of the function `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **results of func_1(n, p) (where n is the first element in the list qs and p is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in p are less than or equal to n)**
