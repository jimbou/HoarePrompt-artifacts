The only variable in the loop head is `n` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `qs`. If `qs` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` has at least two elements, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `qs` must have at least 3 elements and `n` is the third element in the list `qs`.
State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list containing at least three elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, and `stdin` is empty, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` are printed three times, separated by spaces**
