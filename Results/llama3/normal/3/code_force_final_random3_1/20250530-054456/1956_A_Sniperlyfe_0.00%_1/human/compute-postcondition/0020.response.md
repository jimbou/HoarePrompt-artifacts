The `print` statement is executing the expression `' '.join(map(str, res))`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what this expression does:

1. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The exact value of `res` is not specified, but it's a list of some sort.
2. `map(str, res)` applies the `str` function to each element in the `res` list. This converts each element to a string.
3. `' '.join(...)` takes the list of strings produced by `map` and joins them together into a single string, with spaces in between each element.

So, the output will be a string containing the elements of the `res` list, separated by spaces.

Output: **a string containing the elements of the res list, separated by spaces**
