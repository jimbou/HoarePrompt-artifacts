Output State: **`n` is the second element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list containing at least two elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, and `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `res` now contains two elements, both of which are the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p`.
