The function accepts a list of distinct positive integers `p` and a list of positive integers `qs`, and for each integer `n` in `qs`, it calls another function `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. The function then prints the list `res` containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`. After execution, the function leaves the input variables unchanged, with `p` remaining a list of distinct positive integers, `qs` becoming an empty list, and `res` containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`.
