Based on the precondition, the code prints a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)`, `func_1(n, p)`, and `func_1(n, p)`. Here, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, and `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `p` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the results of `func_1(n, p)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where [result of func_1(n, p)] is the result of func_1(n, p) with n being the second element of the list qs and p being a list of distinct positive integers less than or equal to n)**
