Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and the list `p` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input from stdin. Since stdin initially contains an integer input, after this input is read and assigned to `t`, stdin becomes empty.
