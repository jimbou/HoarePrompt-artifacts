Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**

The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since the initial state of `res` is an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the specific value of `func_1(n, p)` is not provided, so it is represented as a function call in the output state.
