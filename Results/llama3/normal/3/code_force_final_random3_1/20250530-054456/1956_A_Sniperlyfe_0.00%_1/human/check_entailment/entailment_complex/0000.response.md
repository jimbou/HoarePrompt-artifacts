Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the number of players declared as winners in a game based on an increasing sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and the number of players `n_i` in the game initially.

Function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `p` as input and returns a non-negative integer `n` that is equal to the difference between the initial value of `n` and the count of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to the initial value of `n`. This function effectively simulates the game by subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` itself, until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.

Function `func_2` accepts a list of distinct positive integers `p` and a list of positive integers `qs`, and for each integer `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. The function then prints the list `res` containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`.

The program correctly implements the problem description by using `func_1` to simulate the game for each number of players `n_i` and `func_2` to manage the input and output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
