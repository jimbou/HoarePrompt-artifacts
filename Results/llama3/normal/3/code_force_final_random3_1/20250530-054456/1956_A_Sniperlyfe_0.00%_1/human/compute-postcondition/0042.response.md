Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is 2, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list containing at least three elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `n` is the third element in the list `qs`, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, while the other variables remain unchanged. The result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a space-separated list of integers.
