Output State: **`n` is the last element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is an empty list, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final state. The value of `n` is the last element in the list `qs`, and the list `p` contains distinct positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `k` and `q` remain as integers, and the list `p` remains a list of integers. The list `qs` is empty, and the list `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`. The standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
