Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the game until no more players can be removed. The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each query, and prints the results.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the number of players is less than the minimum position in the sequence `p`, the function `func_1` returns the number of players immediately.
* When the number of players is greater than or equal to the minimum position in the sequence `p`, the function `func_1` correctly removes players from the game until no more players can be removed.
* When the sequence `p` is empty, the function `func_1` returns the number of players immediately.
* When the number of queries is 0, the function `func_2` does not print anything.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the number of players is 1 or when the sequence `p` contains only one element.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game logic and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
