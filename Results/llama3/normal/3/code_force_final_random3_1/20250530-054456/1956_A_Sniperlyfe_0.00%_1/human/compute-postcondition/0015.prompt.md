Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, p is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in p are less than or equal to n, t is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of integers, qs is a list of integers, res is an empty list, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for n in qs:
    res.append(func_1(n, p))
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a string of space-separated integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the next element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and the following is printed: a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
