Output State: **`n` is the last element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is an empty list, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all elements in `qs`, and a string of space-separated integers representing all results of `func_1(n, p)` is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `n` will be the last element in the list `qs`, and the list `qs` will be empty. The list `res` will contain the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all elements in `qs`. The other variables `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` will remain unchanged. A string of space-separated integers representing all results of `func_1(n, p)` will be printed.
