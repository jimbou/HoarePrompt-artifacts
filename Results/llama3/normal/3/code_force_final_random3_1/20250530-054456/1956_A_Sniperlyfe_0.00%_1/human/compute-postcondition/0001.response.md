According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer, stdin contains no input. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains no input.**
