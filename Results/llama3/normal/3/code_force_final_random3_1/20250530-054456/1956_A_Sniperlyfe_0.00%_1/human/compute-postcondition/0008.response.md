Output State: **`n` is the next element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the result of `func_1(n, p)` which is printed as a string of space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `res` now contains an additional element which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`. The result of `func_1(n, p)` is also printed as a string of space-separated integers. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
