Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is 2, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is an empty list, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`, `stdin` is empty, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs` is printed as a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `qs` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element in `qs` and the corresponding list `p`. The standard input `stdin` will be empty because all inputs have been consumed. The results of `func_1` for each element in `qs` will have been printed as space-separated lists of integers. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
