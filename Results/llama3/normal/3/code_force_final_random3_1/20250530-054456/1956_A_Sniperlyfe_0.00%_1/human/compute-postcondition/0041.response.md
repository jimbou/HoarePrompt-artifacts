To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for n in qs:`, so we can only adjust the state of `n` and `qs`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If the list `qs` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, and `qs` contains at least two elements.

For the loop to execute again, `qs` must have at least three elements, and `n` must be the third element in the list `qs`.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is 2, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list containing at least three elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `n` is the third element in the list `qs`, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a space-separated list of integers, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a space-separated list of integers**
