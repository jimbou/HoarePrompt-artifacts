The `print` statement will print the elements of the `res` list as a string of space-separated integers.

Since `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the result of `func_1(n, p)`, we need to understand what `func_1(n, p)` returns.

However, the problem doesn't provide the definition of `func_1(n, p)`, so we can't determine the exact values returned by this function.

But we can describe the output in terms of the given information.

Output: **The result of func_1(n, p) and the result of func_1(n, p) as a string of space-separated integers, where n is the next element in the list qs and p is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in p are less than or equal to n**
