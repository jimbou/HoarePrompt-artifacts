Output State: **`n` is the second element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and the following is printed: a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` and `func_1(n, p)`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `res` now contains three results of the function `func_1(n, p)`, and three strings of space-separated integers representing these results are printed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
