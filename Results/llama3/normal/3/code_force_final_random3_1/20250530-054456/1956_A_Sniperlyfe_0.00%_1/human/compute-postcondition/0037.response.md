To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which is `n` and `qs`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `qs`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the first element in the list `qs`, and `qs` contains at least one element.

For the loop to execute again, `qs` must contain at least two elements, and `n` must be the second element in the list `qs`.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is 2, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list containing at least two elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `stdin` contains 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a space-separated list of integers**
