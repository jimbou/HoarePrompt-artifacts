The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1, so `t` is 2.
State: **`n` is the last element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is 2, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list containing at least one element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`, and `stdin` is empty, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` are printed for each element in `qs`, separated by spaces.**
