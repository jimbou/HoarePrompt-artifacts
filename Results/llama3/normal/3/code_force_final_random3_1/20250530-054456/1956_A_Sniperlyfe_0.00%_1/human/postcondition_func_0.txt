This function takes a non-negative integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `p` as input, and returns a non-negative integer `n` that is equal to the difference between the initial value of `n` and the count of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to the initial value of `n`. The function effectively subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` itself, until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
