The code prints the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, where `n` is the third element in the list `qs` and `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`. The result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a space-separated list of integers.
Output: **the result of func_1(n, p) three times, where n is the third element in the list qs and p is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in p are less than or equal to n, as a space-separated list of integers**
