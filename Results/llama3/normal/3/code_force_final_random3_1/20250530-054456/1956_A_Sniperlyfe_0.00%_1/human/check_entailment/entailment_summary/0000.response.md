Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves simulating a game where players are eliminated based on their positions in a row. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `p` as input and returns a non-negative integer `n` that is equal to the difference between the initial value of `n` and the count of elements in list `p` that are less than or equal to the initial value of `n`. This function effectively simulates the elimination process in the game, where players are removed from the row based on their positions.

`func_2` is the main function that accepts a list of distinct positive integers `p` and a list of positive integers `qs`, and for each integer `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. The function then prints the list `res` containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_1` correctly simulates the elimination process in the game, and `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each element in `qs` and prints the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
