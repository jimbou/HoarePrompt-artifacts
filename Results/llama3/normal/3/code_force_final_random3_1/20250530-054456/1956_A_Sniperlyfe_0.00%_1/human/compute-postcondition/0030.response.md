Output State: **`n` is the last element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list containing at least one element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`, and `stdin` is empty, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` are printed for each element in `qs`, separated by spaces.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed for all iterations, the variable `n` will be the last element in the list `qs`, and the list `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element in `qs` and the list `p`. The results will be printed, separated by spaces, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
