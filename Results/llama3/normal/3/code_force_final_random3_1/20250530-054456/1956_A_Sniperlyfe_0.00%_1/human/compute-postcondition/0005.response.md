The code prints the elements of the `res` list, which contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is a positive integer and `p` is a list of distinct positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The elements are converted to strings and joined with spaces in between.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, p) (where n is a positive integer and p is a list of distinct positive integers less than or equal to n)**
