The code prints the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, where `n` is the second element in the list `qs` and `p` is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n`. The result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a space-separated list of integers.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where n is the second element in the list qs and p is a list of distinct positive integers such that all elements in p are less than or equal to n)**
