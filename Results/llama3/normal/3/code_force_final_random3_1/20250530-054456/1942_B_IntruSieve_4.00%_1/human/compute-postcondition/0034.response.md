Based on the precondition, the code prints the first element of the list `mex`, which is `itm`. The value of `itm` is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn`, where `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.

If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `itm` is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn`, which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`.

If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `itm` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`.

Since the exact values of `arr[i]`, `minn`, and `maxx` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `itm`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first element of the list `mex`, which is `itm`.

Output: **itm (where itm is the first element of the list mex, which is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of arr[i] and minn)**
