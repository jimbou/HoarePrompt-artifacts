To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we know that `n` is an integer and `arr` is a list of `n` integers. However, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0**
