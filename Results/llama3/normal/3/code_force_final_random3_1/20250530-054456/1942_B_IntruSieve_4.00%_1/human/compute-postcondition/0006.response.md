Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing the value 0, if `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` and `i` remains 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.***
