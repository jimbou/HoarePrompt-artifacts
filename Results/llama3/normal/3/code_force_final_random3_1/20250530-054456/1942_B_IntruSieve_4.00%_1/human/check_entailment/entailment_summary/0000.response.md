Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p based on the given array a. The program uses two variables, minn and maxx, to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer not present in the input list and the maximum value in the input list, respectively. It iterates through the input list and appends the minimum non-negative integer not present in the list or the absolute difference between the absolute value of an input integer and the minimum non-negative integer not present in the list to the mex list. Finally, it prints the elements of the mex list, which represents a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a.

Correctness: **True**
