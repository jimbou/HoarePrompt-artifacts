Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the array `a` and constructing the permutation `p` based on the given condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It initializes two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation `p` so far.
2. It iterates through the array `a`. For each element `a_i`, it checks if `a_i` is positive.
3. If `a_i` is positive, it appends the current value of `minn` to the permutation `p` and increments `minn` by 1. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` by 1 again to ensure that `minn` is always greater than `maxx`.
4. If `a_i` is not positive (i.e., it's negative or zero), it appends the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the permutation `p`. If this value is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx` to be this value.
5. Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program's logic seems to be correct, as it's attempting to construct the permutation `p` based on the given condition and ensuring that the MEX of the permutation is correctly calculated.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the case where `a_i` is negative, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the permutation `p`. However, this calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `minn - arr[i]`, not `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

This mistake can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
