Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of arr[i] and minn which is maxx + 2, `minn` is maxx + 1, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn if the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn is greater than maxx, otherwise maxx remains 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of arr[i] is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-2 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to `maxx + 1`, and the value of `mex` has been updated to either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn`, which is now `maxx + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
