Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 2`, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is `n`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.
Code of the loop:
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 2`, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is `n`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `mex` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `itm` is the first element in the list, and the first element of the list `mex` which is `itm` is printed followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 2`, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is `n`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `mex` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `itm` is the second element in the list, and the first element of the list `mex` which is `itm` is printed followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 2`, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is `n`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `mex` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `itm` is the third element in the list, and the first element of the list `mex` which is `itm` is printed followed by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
