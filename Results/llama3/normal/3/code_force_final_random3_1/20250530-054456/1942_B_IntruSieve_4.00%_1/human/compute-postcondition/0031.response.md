The code prints the first element of the list `mex`, which is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn`. Here, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, and `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0.

Output: **the first element of the list mex (which is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of arr[i] and minn)**
