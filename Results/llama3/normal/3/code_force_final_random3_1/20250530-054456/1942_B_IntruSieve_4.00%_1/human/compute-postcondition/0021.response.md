The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 2`, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is 2, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`.**
