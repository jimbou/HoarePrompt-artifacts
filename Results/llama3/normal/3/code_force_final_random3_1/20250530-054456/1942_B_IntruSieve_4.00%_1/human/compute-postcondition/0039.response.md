Output State: **mex is a list that must have at least n elements, itm is the nth element in the list, and the first element of the list mex which is itm is printed followed by a space.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `mex` will have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the number of integers in the list `arr`. The loop will iterate over each element in `mex` and print the element followed by a space. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `arr`, `minn`, `maxx`, and `i`, remains unchanged.
