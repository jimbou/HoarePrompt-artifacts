Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.***
