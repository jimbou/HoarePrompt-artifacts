Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is 0, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1, and `mex` has been appended with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.**

In natural language, the code appends the absolute difference between the current element in the array `arr` and the minimum value `minn` to the list `mex`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `minn`, `maxx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of a new element to the `mex` list.
