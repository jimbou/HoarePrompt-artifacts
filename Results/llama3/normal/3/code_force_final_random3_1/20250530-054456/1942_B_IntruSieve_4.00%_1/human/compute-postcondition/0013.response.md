The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is 0, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1**
