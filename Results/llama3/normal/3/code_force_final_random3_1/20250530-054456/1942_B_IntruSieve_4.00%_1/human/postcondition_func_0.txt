This function takes an integer n and a list of n integers as input, processes the list based on the values of the integers, and prints a new list of integers. The function generates a new list, mex, where each element is either the minimum non-negative integer not present in the input list or the absolute difference between the absolute value of an input integer and the minimum non-negative integer not present in the input list. The function then prints the elements of the mex list, separated by spaces.
