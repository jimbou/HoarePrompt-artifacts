Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 2`, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is `n`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged.
*   The list `arr` remains unchanged.
*   The list `mex` contains the minimum excluded values for each iteration of the loop. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.
*   The value of `minn` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`.
*   The value of `maxx` is updated based on the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. If the absolute difference is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference.
*   The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed all iterations.
