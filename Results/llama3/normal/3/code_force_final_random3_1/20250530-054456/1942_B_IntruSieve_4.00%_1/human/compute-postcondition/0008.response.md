Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is 0, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0, and the value of `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The code appends the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element in the array (`arr[i]`) and the minimum value (`minn`, which is 0) to the list `mex`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` is still the same, and the array `arr` and its elements are also unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0, and the value of `arr[i]` is still less than or equal to 0.
