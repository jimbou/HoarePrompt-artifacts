Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing the value 0, `minn` is equal to `maxx + 1`, and `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` is updated to be one more than the value of `maxx`. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 inputs, `n` is still greater than 0, `arr` is still a list of `n` integers, `mex` still contains the value 0, and `i` is still 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is still greater than 0.
