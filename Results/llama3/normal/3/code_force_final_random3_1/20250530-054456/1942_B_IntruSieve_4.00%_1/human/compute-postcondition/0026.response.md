Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 2`, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `i` is 2, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `maxx` is updated to be the absolute difference between the current value of `arr[i]` and `minn`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mex` and `minn` may be updated based on the value of `arr[i]` and the previous values of `minn` and `maxx`. The value of `i` remains 2, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.
