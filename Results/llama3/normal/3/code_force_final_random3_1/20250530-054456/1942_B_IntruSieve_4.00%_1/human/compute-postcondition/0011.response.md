Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is 0, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is 0, and the value of `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0.***
