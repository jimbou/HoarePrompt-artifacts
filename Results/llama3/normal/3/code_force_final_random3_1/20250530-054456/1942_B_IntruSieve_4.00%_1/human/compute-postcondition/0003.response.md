Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing the value 0, `minn` is 1, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended the initial value of `minn` (which is 0) to the `mex` list, and then incremented `minn` by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
