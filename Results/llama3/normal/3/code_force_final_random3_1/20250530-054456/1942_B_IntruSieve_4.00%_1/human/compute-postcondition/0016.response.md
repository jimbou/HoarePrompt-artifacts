Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), mex is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of arr[i] and minn which is either 1 or maxx + 2, minn is either 1 or maxx + 1, maxx is either 0 or the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn if the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn is greater than maxx, otherwise maxx remains 0, i is 1, and the current value of arr[i] is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-2 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).***
