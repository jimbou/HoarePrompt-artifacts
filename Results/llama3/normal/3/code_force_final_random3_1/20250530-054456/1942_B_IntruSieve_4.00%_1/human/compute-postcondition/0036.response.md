The only object in the loop head is the variable `itm` and list `mex`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex` list. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `mex` has at least 2 elements, `itm` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `itm` is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 2`, `minn` is either 0, 1, or `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is `n`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is either 1 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `minn` is updated to either 0 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `mex` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `itm` is the third element in the list, and the first element of the list `mex` which is `itm` is printed followed by a space.**
