Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (-`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`), `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `maxx + 1`, `minn` is `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is either 0 or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `maxx + 1` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `maxx + 1` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains 0, `i` is 2, and the current value of `arr[i]` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `maxx + 1` which is either 2 or `maxx + 2`, and `minn` is updated to either 2 or `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `maxx + 1`, and `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `maxx`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `mex` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is updated with either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `maxx + 1`, which is either 2 or `maxx + 2`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is updated with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `maxx + 1`. The value of `minn` is updated to either 1 or `maxx + 1` if `minn` is equal to `maxx`.
