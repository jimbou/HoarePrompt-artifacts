Output State: **stdin contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0**

The code first reads an integer t from stdin, which is not stored in any variable. Then, for each test case, it reads an integer n and stores it in the variable n. It also reads n integers from stdin and stores them in the list arr. The variables mex, minn, and maxx are initialized as an empty list, 0, and 0, respectively.
