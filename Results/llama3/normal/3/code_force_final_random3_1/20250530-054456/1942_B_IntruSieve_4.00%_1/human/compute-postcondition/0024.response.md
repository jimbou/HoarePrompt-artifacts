Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), mex is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of arr[i] and minn which is either 1, 2, or maxx + 2, minn is either 1, 2, or maxx + 1, maxx is either 0 or the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn if the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn is greater than maxx, otherwise maxx remains 0, i is 2, and the current value of arr[i] is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0. If minn is equal to maxx, then minn is updated to maxx + 1. If arr[i] is greater than 0, mex is updated with either the value 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of arr[i] and minn which is either 2 or maxx + 2, and minn is updated to either 2 or maxx + 1. If arr[i] is less than or equal to 0, mex is updated with the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, and minn is updated to either 1 or maxx + 1 if minn is equal to maxx.***
