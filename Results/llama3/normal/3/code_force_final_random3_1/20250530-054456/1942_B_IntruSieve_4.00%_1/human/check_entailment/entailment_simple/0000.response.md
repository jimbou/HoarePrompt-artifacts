Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a list `mex` to store the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to each index `i`. The program then uses this list to construct the permutation `p`.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program does not correctly calculate the `mex` values. The `mex` value at each index `i` should be the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to index `i`. However, the program calculates the `mex` value as either `minn` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which is not correct.

2. The program does not correctly update the `minn` and `maxx` values. The `minn` value should be updated to the next non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to index `i`, and the `maxx` value should be updated to the maximum value in the array `p` up to index `i`. However, the program updates these values incorrectly.

3. The program does not correctly construct the permutation `p`. The permutation `p` should be constructed by using the `mex` values calculated earlier. However, the program simply prints the `mex` values, which is not correct.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
