Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a valid permutation `p` based on an input array `a`. The program uses a list `mex` to store the minimum non-negative integer not present in the input list, and then constructs the permutation `p` based on the values in `mex`.

The program correctly handles the cases where `arr[i]` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, and updates the `minn` and `maxx` variables accordingly. The program also correctly prints the elements of the `mex` list, separated by spaces.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program does not handle the case where `n` is 0. In this case, the program will not print anything, but it should print an empty line.
2. The program does not handle the case where `arr` is an empty list. In this case, the program will not print anything, but it should print an empty line.
3. The program does not handle the case where `arr` contains non-integer values. In this case, the program will raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert the non-integer value to an integer.

Despite these issues, the program is correct for the given problem description and input format.

Correctness: **True**
