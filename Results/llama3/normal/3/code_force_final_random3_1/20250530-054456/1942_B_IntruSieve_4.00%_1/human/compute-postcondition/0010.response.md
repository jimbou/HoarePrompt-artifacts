Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` which is 0, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, `i` is 0, the value of `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, and the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than or equal to `maxx`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code updates the value of `maxx` to be the absolute difference between the current element in the array `arr` at index `i` and the minimum value `minn`, which is 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `maxx` is now equal to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and this difference is greater than or equal to the previous value of `maxx`.
