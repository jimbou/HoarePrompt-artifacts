Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders (rx, ry) and the value of freq[current_pair] is increased by 1, and `count` is equal to the previous value of count plus the value of freq[rx, ry].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1, where `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
