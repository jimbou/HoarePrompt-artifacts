Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `freq`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `freq`, `a` is the last element in `arr`, `rx` is a positive integer equal to the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is a positive integer equal to the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple equal to `(a % x, a % y)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with one tuple containing the value of `count`, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with the same number of elements as the initial number of tuples in `test_cases`, `a` is the last element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, `freq` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the keys are tuples of the form (rx, ry) and the values are the frequencies of these tuples in arr, and `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all tuples in freq that are of the form (rx, ry) for some a in arr.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `a` is the last element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `freq` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the key is a tuple of remainders `(rx, ry)`, `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `freq[rx, ry]` for all pairs `(rx, ry)` in `freq`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
