The `print(result)` statement will print the first element in the `results` list, which is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first element of the `results` list.

Output: **the first element in the results list (which is the return value of func_1(test_cases))**
