According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` is not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is an integer equal to 2 * `t` + 1, and `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`. For the loop to be executed, `results` must not be empty and `result` is the first element in the `results`.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases) that must not be empty, result is the first element in the results**
