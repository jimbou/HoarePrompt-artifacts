Output State: **test_cases is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is an empty list, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `freq` and sets `count` to 0. No other variables are affected. The initial state of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remains unchanged.
