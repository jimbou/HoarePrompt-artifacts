Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than 1, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 5**

The code snippet modifies the `test_cases` list by appending a new tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from the string at index `idx` in the `data` list, split into integers using the `map` function. The value of `arr` is extracted from the string at index `idx + 1` in the `data` list, split into integers using the `map` function. The `idx` variable is then incremented by 2.

The final state includes the updated `test_cases` list with the new tuple, and the incremented value of `idx`. The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged.
