Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders `(rx, ry)` and the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1, and `count` is equal to the previous value of `count` plus the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `freq[current_pair]` has been incremented by 1. This means that the frequency of the current pair of remainders `(rx, ry)` has been increased by 1 in the dictionary `freq`. All other variables remain unchanged.
