Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 7**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 2, and a new tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` has been appended to the `test_cases` list. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are determined by the strings at the current and next indices in the `data` list, which are split into integers and assigned to these variables. The rest of the variables, `t` and `data`, remain unchanged.
