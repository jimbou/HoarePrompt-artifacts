Output State: **test_cases is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list with at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the tuple (rx, ry) and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is a key in freq, otherwise freq[current_pair] is 1, and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of count has been increased by the value of freq[rx, ry]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary freq still contains at least one key-value pair, and the key (rx, ry) has its value increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary, otherwise, the key current_pair has a value of 1.
