Output State: **test_cases is an empty list of tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list with the same number of elements as the initial number of tuples in test_cases, a is the last element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, freq is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the keys are tuples of the form (rx, ry) and the values are the frequencies of these tuples in arr, and count is the sum of the frequencies of all tuples in freq that are of the form (rx, ry) for some a in arr.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `test_cases` will be empty, the list `arr` will contain the same number of elements as the initial number of tuples in `test_cases`, and the dictionary `freq` will contain the frequencies of all tuples of the form `(rx, ry)` in `arr`. The variable `count` will be the sum of the frequencies of all tuples in `freq` that are of the form `(rx, ry)` for some `a` in `arr`. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged.
