Postcondition: ***test_cases is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list with at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the tuple (rx, ry) and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is a key in freq, otherwise freq[current_pair] is 1. If (rx, ry) is a key in freq, then the count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry].***
