Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the tuple (rx, ry) and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is a key in freq, otherwise freq[current_pair] is 1, and freq[current_pair] is now 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial properties, and the only change is that the frequency of the current pair in the dictionary `freq` is now 1.
