Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, and idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1. This means that the loop has executed t times, and idx has been incremented by 2 for each iteration, resulting in a final value of 2 * t + 1.
