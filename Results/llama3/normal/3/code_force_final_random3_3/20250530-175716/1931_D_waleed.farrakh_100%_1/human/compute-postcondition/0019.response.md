Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four values: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. The function does not modify the input test cases. The purpose of the function is to perform some operation on each test case and produce a corresponding result. The final state of the program is that the results are printed to the console, one result per line.**
