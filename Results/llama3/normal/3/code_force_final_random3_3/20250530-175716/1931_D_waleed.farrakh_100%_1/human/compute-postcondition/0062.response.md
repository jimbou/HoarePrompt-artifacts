Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with one tuple containing the value of `count`, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with the same number of elements as the initial number of tuples in `test_cases`, `a` is the last element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, `freq` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the keys are tuples of the form (rx, ry) and the values are the frequencies of these tuples in arr, and `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all tuples in freq that are of the form (rx, ry) for some a in arr.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been appended to the `test_cases` list, which now contains one tuple with the value of `count`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
