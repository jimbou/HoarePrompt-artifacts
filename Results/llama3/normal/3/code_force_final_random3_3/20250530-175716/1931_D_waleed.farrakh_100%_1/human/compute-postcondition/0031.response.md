Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `freq`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `freq`, `a` is the last element in `arr`, `rx` is a positive integer equal to the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is a positive integer equal to the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple equal to `(a % x, a % y)`**

In this output state, the only change is that the `results` list now contains the sum of the values of `freq`, which is stored in the `count` variable. All other variables remain unchanged.
