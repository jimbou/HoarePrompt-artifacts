Functionality: **This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. The function processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers arr, and for each integer a, it calculates the remainder of -a modulo x and the remainder of a modulo y. It then checks if this pair of remainders is present in a frequency dictionary freq, and if so, increments a count variable by the frequency of this pair. The function also updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of count values, one for each test case.**
