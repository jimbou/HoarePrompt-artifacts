Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, then `count` is equal to the previous value of `count` plus the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, `current_pair` is a tuple of two values: the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `a` is the third element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, and `freq[current_pair]` is now 1.**

In this output state, the value of `freq[current_pair]` has been updated to 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `freq` now contains the key-value pair `(current_pair, 1)`, where `current_pair` is a tuple of two values: the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`.
