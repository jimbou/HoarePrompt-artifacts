Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases)
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases) that must not be empty, result is the first element in the results, and the first element in the results which is result is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases) that must have at least two elements, result is the second element in the results, and the second element in the results is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases) that must have at least three elements, result is the third element in the results, and the third element in the results which is result is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
