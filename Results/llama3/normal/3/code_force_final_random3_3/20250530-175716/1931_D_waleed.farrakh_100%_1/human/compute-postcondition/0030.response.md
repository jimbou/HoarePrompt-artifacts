Output State: **test_cases is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is an empty list, results is an empty list, freq is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is a tuple (rx, ry), count is equal to the sum of the values of freq, a is the last element in arr, rx is a positive integer equal to the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is a positive integer equal to the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple equal to (a % x, a % y).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the list `arr` is empty, and the dictionary `freq` contains key-value pairs where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)` and the value is the frequency of the pair. The variable `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `freq`, which represents the total count of pairs. The variables `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` are updated to their last values in the loop. The other variables `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
