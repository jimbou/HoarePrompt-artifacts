Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders `(rx, ry)` and `freq[current_pair]` is 1, and `count` is equal to the previous value of `count` plus the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the dictionary `freq` now contains a new key-value pair where the key is the `current_pair` tuple and the value is 1. The `count` variable remains unchanged since the `current_pair` was not in the dictionary `freq` before.
