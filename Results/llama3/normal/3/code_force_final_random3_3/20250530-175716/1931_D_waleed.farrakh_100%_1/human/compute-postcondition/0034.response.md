According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least 1 element. The variable `a` is also in the loop head, so it needs to be adjusted to be the first element in the list `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`**
