Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list with at least one element, a is the first element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, freq is an empty dictionary, and count is 0**

The code snippet updates the values of `rx` and `ry` based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The first line calculates the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x` and assigns it to `rx`. The second line calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `y` and assigns it to `ry`. The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` are used directly in these calculations. The other variables, including `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`, `current_pair`, `freq`, and `count`, are not affected by the code snippet.
