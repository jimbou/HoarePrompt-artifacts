Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a frequency dictionary to store the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions for each remainder when divided by x and y. The program then iterates through the array, calculates the remainder when each element is divided by x and y, and checks if the corresponding pair exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it increments the count of beautiful pairs. The program handles all possible cases, including when x or y is 1, and when the array contains duplicate elements. The program also correctly handles the case when the sum of two elements is divisible by x and the difference is divisible by y, but the pair is not beautiful because the elements are not distinct.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It handles all edge cases and potential inputs, and it produces the correct output for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
