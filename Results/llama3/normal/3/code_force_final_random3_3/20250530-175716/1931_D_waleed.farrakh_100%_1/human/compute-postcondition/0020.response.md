Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is an empty list, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (rx, ry), if (rx, ry) is in freq, then count is equal to the previous value of count plus the value of freq[rx, ry], current_pair is a tuple of two values: the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, and freq[current_pair] is now 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the frequency dictionary `freq` now has a new key-value pair where the key is the current pair of remainders `current_pair` and the value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
