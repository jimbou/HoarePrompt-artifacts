Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers arr, and for each integer a, it calculates the remainder of -a modulo x and the remainder of a modulo y. It then checks if this pair of remainders is present in a frequency dictionary freq, and if so, increments a count variable by the frequency of this pair. The function also updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of count values, one for each test case.

func_2 reads input from the standard input, processes it into a list of test cases, and then calls func_1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results to the console.

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
