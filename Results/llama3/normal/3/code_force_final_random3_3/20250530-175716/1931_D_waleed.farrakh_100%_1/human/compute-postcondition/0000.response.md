Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 1, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin.**

The code reads the input from sys.stdin and splits it into lines, storing it in the data variable. The first line of the input is converted to an integer and stored in the variable t. The test_cases list is initialized as an empty list. The idx variable is set to 1. The input function is reassigned to read from sys.stdin.
