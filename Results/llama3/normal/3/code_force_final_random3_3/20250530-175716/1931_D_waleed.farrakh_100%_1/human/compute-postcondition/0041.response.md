Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, and `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their previous values and properties, except for the value of `freq[current_pair]`, which is incremented by 1. This means that the frequency count for the current pair of remainders (rx, ry) is increased by 1 in the dictionary `freq`.
