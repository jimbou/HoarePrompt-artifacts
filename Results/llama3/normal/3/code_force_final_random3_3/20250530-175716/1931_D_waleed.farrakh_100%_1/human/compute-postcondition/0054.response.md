Output State: **test_cases is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list with at least 3 elements, a is the third element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the tuple (rx, ry) and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is a key in freq, otherwise freq[current_pair] is 1. If current_pair is already in freq, freq[current_pair] is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is set to 1.**

The code snippet provided modifies the values of `rx` and `ry` based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The first line calculates the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x` and assigns it to `rx`. The second line calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `y` and assigns it to `ry`. These changes do not affect any other variables in the initial state. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `current_pair`, and `freq` remain unchanged.
