Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is an empty list, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (rx, ry), if (rx, ry) is in freq, then count is equal to the previous value of count plus the value of freq[rx, ry], current_pair is a tuple of two values: the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y. If current_pair is in freq, the value of freq[current_pair] is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is now 1.***
