Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the tuple (rx, ry) and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is a key in freq, otherwise freq[current_pair] is 1. If current_pair is already in freq, freq[current_pair] is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is set to 1, and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is a key in freq.**

The code updates the value of `current_pair` to be a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `freq` is not changed in this code snippet, but its value is still valid as described in the initial state.
