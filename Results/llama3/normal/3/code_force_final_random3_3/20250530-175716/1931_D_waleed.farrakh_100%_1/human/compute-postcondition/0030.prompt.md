Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, results is an empty list, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, results is an empty list, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (rx, ry), count is equal to the previous value of count plus 1, a is the first element in arr, rx is a positive integer equal to the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is a positive integer equal to the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple equal to (a % x, a % y). If current_pair is in freq, the value of freq[current_pair] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, current_pair is added to freq with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is an empty list, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (rx, ry), if (rx, ry) is in freq, then count is equal to the previous value of count plus the value of freq[rx, ry], current_pair is a tuple of two values: the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y. If current_pair is in freq, the value of freq[current_pair] is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is now 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, then `count` is equal to the previous value of `count` plus the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, `current_pair` is a tuple of two values: the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `a` is the third element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
