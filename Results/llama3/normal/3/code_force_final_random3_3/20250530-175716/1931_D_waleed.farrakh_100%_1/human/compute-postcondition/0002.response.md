Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 3**

In this output state, the code has added a new tuple to the test_cases list, containing the values n, x, y, and arr, which are all positive integers. The values of n, x, and y are obtained from the second line of the data list, split into integers, while arr is obtained from the third line of the data list, also split into integers. The idx variable has been incremented by 2, so it is now equal to 3. The values of t and data remain unchanged.
