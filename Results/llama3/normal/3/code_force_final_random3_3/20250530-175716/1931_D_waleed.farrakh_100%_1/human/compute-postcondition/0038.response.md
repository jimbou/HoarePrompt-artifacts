Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y. If the tuple (rx, ry) is a key in the dictionary freq, then `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the tuple (rx, ry) and `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
