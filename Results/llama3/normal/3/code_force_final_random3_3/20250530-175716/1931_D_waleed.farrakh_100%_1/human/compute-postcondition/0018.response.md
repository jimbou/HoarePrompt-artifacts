Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases), result is the last element in the results, and the last element in the results which is result is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables remains the same as before, except for the loop variables. The loop has iterated over all elements in the `results` list, and the last element in `results` is being printed. The other variables, such as `test_cases`, `t`, `data`, and `idx`, remain unchanged.
