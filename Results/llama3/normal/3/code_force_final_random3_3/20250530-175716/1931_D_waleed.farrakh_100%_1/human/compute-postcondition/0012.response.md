To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for result in results:`. The only object in the loop head is `result` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`. If `results` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is not empty, and `result` is the first element in the `results`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements, and `result` must be the second element in the `results`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases) that must have at least two elements, result is the second element in the results**
