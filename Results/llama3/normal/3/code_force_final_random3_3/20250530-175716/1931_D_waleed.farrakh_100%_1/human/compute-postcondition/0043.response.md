Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, and `freq[current_pair]` is 1.**

In this output state, the dictionary `freq` now has a new key-value pair where the key is `current_pair` (which is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`) and the value is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
