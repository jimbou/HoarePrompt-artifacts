Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least three elements, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders `(rx, ry)` and the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1, if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, then `count` is equal to the previous value of `count` plus the new value of `freq[rx, ry]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for the dictionary `freq`, where the value associated with the key `current_pair` (which is a tuple of remainders) is incremented by 1. This change in `freq` may also affect the value of `count`, which is updated accordingly if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`.
