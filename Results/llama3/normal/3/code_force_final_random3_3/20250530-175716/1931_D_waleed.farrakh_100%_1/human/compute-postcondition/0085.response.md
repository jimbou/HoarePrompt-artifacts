Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list with at least three elements, a is the third element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, freq is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders (rx, ry), and count is equal to the previous value of count plus the value of freq[rx, ry].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `rx` and `ry`. The first line assigns the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x` to `rx`. The second line assigns the remainder of `a` divided by `y` to `ry`. The values of `rx` and `ry` are updated based on the current values of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
