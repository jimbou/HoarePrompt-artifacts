Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (rx, ry), `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, and the tuple (rx, ry) is currently a key in the dictionary freq.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases remains non-empty with at least one less tuple than before. The values of n, x, and y remain unchanged as positive integers. The list arr still has at least one element, and the dictionary freq still contains at least one key-value pair with the key being the tuple (rx, ry). The count variable is incremented by the value associated with the key (rx, ry) in the freq dictionary. The values of a, rx, and ry remain unchanged, with a being the first element in arr, rx being the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, and ry being the remainder of a divided by y.
