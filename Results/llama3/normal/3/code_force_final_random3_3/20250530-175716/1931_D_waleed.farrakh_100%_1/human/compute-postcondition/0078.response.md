Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders (rx, ry), and `count` is equal to the previous value of count plus the value of freq[rx, ry]. If current_pair is in freq, the value of freq[current_pair] is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is set to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of `count` has been updated by adding the value of `freq[rx, ry]` to it. The values of all other variables remain the same.
