Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), Polycarp's favorite integers (x and y), and the array itself (arr). func_1 iterates over each test case, initializes a frequency dictionary (freq) to store the counts of pairs that satisfy the conditions, and a count variable to store the total number of beautiful pairs.

For each element a in the array, func_1 calculates the remainders rx and ry when -a is divided by x and a is divided by y, respectively. It then checks if the pair (rx, ry) is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it increments the count by the frequency of that pair. It also updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair (a % x, a % y).

Finally, func_1 returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of beautiful pairs in the corresponding test case.

func_2 reads the input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to calculate the results. It then prints each result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a frequency dictionary to efficiently count the pairs that satisfy the conditions, and it correctly calculates the remainders and updates the frequency dictionary.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the calculation of rx, the program uses (-a % x + x) % x, which is not necessary. The correct calculation for rx should be (-a % x) % x, which is equivalent to -a % x. This is because the remainder of -a divided by x is already in the range [0, x-1], so there is no need to add x and take the remainder again.

Despite this small issue, the program is correct and should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
