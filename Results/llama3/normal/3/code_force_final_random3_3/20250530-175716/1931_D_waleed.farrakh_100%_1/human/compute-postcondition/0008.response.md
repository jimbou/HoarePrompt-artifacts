Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 2 * t + 1, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases)**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial variables remain unchanged, and a new variable `results` is introduced, which holds the return value of the function `func_1` when called with the `test_cases` list as an argument. The value of `results` is not specified, as it depends on the implementation of the `func_1` function.
