Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple containing the value of count, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list with the same number of elements as the initial number of tuples in test_cases, a is the last element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, freq is an empty dictionary, and count is 0
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders `(rx, ry)`, and `count` is equal to the previous value of `count` plus the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, `ry` is the remainder of a divided by y, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders (rx, ry), and `count` is equal to the previous value of count plus the value of freq[rx, ry]. If (rx, ry) is already in freq, the value of freq[current_pair] is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least three elements, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `freq` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple of remainders `(rx, ry)`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, then `count` is equal to the previous value of `count` plus the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
