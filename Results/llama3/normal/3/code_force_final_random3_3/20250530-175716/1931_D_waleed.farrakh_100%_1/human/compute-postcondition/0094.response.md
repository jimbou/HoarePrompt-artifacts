Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `n` is undefined, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `arr` is undefined, `a` is undefined, `rx` is undefined, `ry` is undefined, `current_pair` is undefined, `freq` is undefined, `count` is undefined, and `results` is a list containing the values of `count` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list of test cases is empty, and the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`, `current_pair`, `freq`, and `count` are no longer defined. The only variable that still has a value is `results`, which is a list containing the values of `count` for each iteration of the loop.
