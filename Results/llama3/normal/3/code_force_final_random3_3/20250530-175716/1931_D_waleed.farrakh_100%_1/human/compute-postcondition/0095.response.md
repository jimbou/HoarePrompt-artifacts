Output State: **The program returns a list of values for the variable 'count' for each iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the list 'results' contains the values of 'count' for each iteration of the loop. Since 'count' is undefined in the initial state, the list 'results' will contain undefined values for each iteration.
