Output State: **test_cases is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list with at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list arr, rx is the remainder of -a divided by x plus x modulo x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple containing the remainder of a divided by x and the remainder of a divided by y, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the tuple (rx, ry) and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is a key in freq, otherwise freq[current_pair] is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `rx` and `ry` by recalculating them based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The value of `rx` is now the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, and the value of `ry` is now the remainder of `a` divided by `y`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `current_pair` is also updated to contain the new values of `rx` and `ry`. The dictionary `freq` is updated accordingly, either by increasing the count of the key-value pair `(rx, ry)` if it exists, or by adding a new key-value pair with the value 1 if `(rx, ry)` is not a key in `freq`.
