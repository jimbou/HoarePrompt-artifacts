To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:`.

The objects in the loop head are `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`. We can only adjust the states of these objects.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must still be non-empty. Since we've already processed one tuple, we can assume that the next tuple in the list will be processed in the next iteration.

The states of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not directly related to the loop condition, but they will be updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

The other variables (`results`, `freq`, `count`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair`) are not part of the loop head, so their states cannot be adjusted.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with at least one less tuple than before), `n` is a positive integer (new value from the next tuple), `x` is a positive integer (new value from the next tuple), `y` is a positive integer (new value from the next tuple), `arr` is an empty list (new value from the next tuple)**
