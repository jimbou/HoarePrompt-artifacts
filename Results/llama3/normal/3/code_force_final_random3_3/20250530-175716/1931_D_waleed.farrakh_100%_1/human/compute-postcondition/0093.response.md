The code appends the value of `count` to the list `results`. The value of `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `freq[rx, ry]` for all pairs `(rx, ry)` in `freq`. Since the value of `count` is not changed, the value of `count` remains the same.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `a` is the last element in the list `arr`, `rx` is the remainder of `-a` divided by `x` plus `x` modulo `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `freq` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the key is a tuple of remainders `(rx, ry)`, `count` is equal to the sum of the values of `freq[rx, ry]` for all pairs `(rx, ry)` in `freq`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.**
