Output State: **n is greater than 1, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the integer in ar at index i+1, minn is positive infinity, i is i+1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, t is greater than 0, and the current element in ar at index i+1 is not equal to the integer in ar at index i**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `num` has been updated to the integer in `ar` at the new index `i`. The value of `same` has been reset to 1, and the value of `minn` has been updated to the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same`, which is still positive infinity. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `t` remain unchanged.
