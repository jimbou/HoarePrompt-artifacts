Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the last integer in ar, i is n, minn is the minimum of all the sequences of consecutive equal integers in ar, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `same` is reset to 1, `num` is updated to the last integer in the list `ar`, and `i` is set to the length of `ar`, which is `n`. The variable `minn` is updated to the minimum length of all sequences of consecutive equal integers in `ar`. The state of the other variables, `n`, `ar`, and `stdin`, remains unchanged.
