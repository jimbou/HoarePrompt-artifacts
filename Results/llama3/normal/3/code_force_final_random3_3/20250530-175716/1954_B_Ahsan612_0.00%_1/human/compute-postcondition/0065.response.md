To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than the length of `ar` after the previous iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i+1`, which means it has been incremented. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the length of `ar` to be greater than the new value of `i`.

The state of `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the length of `ar` to be greater than the new value of `i`, which is `i+1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of at least `i+2` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1 or 2, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `i` is `i+1`, and `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)`**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `ar` to ensure the loop can execute again, and left the other variables unchanged.
