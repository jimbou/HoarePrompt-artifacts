Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar` and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ar` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `num` is still the last integer in `ar`. The value of `i` is still equal to the length of `ar`, and `same` is still 1.
