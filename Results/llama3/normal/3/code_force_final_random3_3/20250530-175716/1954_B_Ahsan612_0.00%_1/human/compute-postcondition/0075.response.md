Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `ar` remain unchanged, `same` is reset to 1, `num` is the last integer in the list `ar`, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar`.
