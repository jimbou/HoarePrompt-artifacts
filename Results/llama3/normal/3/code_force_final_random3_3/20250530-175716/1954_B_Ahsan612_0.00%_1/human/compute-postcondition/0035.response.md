Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n. If the current value of ar[i] is equal to num, then same is 2, num is the first integer in ar, i is 1, and minn is infinity. Otherwise, same is 1, num is the second integer in ar, i is 2, and minn is 1. In both cases, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.***
