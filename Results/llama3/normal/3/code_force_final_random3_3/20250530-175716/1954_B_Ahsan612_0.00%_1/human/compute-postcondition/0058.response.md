The only variable in the loop head is variable i and ar, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of n integers between 1 and n. `n` being an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 and `ar` being a list of n integers between 1 and n does ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, i is 1, minn is infinity, stdin contains t - 3 test cases**
