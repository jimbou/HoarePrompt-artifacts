Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of at least `i+1` integers between 1 and `n`. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 or 4 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `same` is 2, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar` if `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)` or `min(infinity, 2)` or `min(infinity, 3)`, and `i` is less than `len(ar)` and `i` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is increased by 1. The other variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the conditions for `same`, `num`, and `minn` are updated based on the new value of `i`. The list `ar` still contains at least `i+1` integers between 1 and `n`, and `n` is still an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5.
