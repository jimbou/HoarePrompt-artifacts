Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, i is 1, minn is infinity, stdin contains t - 3 test cases.**

The code snippet reads the value of `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads a list of `n` integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `ar`. The variable `same` is initialized to 1, and the variable `num` is assigned the value of the first integer in the list `ar`. The variable `i` is initialized to 1, and the variable `minn` is initialized to infinity. The stdin now contains `t - 3` test cases.
