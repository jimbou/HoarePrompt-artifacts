According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3, 4 or `i+3`, and `n` is greater than `i+1`. `n` being greater than `i+1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i+2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than `i+2`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2 or 3, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, `minn` is either 1 or positive infinity, `i` is either 3, 4 or `i+3`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or `i+3`.**
