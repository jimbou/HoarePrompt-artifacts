Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is either 1 or the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in ar, num is the last integer in ar, i is equal to n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, t is greater than 0. If minn is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, minn, which is the minimum of minn and same, is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `n`, `minn` is the minimum of 1 and the minimum of all the sequences of consecutive equal integers in `ar`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. If `minn` is infinity, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the minimum of 1 and the minimum of all the sequences of consecutive equal integers in `ar`, which is `minn`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar` and 1. If `minn` is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar` which is `minn` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
