The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`.  If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 4 or 5 and `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be less than `n` and `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer between 6 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `minn` is infinity. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then if the first integer in `ar` is equal to the second integer in `ar`, `i` is 4, `num` is the third integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 5, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum of the first integer in `ar` and 1. In both cases, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**
