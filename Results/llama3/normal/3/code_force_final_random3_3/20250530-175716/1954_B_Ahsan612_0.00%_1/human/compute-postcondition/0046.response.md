Output State: **`n` is an integer between 6 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 4, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `minn` is infinity. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then if the first integer in `ar` is equal to the second integer in `ar`, `i` is 5, `num` is the third integer in `ar`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is either 6 or 7, `num` is either the fourth or fifth integer in `ar`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of the first integer in `ar` and 1. In all cases, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is still 5. If `ar[i]` was not equal to `num` and the first integer in `ar` was equal to the second integer in `ar`, then `i` is now 5. Otherwise, `i` is either 6 or 7. The values of `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` remain the same. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.
