To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `ar` (or more specifically, `len(ar)`) since these are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, and `len(ar)` is `n`, where `n` is greater than 1.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` can be either 2 or `i+2`, we need to consider the maximum possible value of `i`, which is `i+2`. Therefore, we need to adjust `len(ar)` to be greater than `i+2`.

Additionally, since `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i+2` to satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than `i+2`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0**
