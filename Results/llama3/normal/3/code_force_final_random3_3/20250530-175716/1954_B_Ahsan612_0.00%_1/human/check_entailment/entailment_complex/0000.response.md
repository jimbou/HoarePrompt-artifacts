Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer. It does this by maintaining a variable `same` that counts the number of consecutive occurrences of the current integer, and a variable `minn` that keeps track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences seen so far.

The program correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same, in which case it prints -1. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple blocks of consecutive occurrences of the same integer, by updating `minn` whenever it encounters a new block.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only one block of consecutive occurrences of the same integer, and the length of this block is greater than 1. In this case, the program will print the length of the block, which is not the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

For example, if the input array is [1, 1, 1, 1], the program will print 4, but the correct answer is 3, because removing any three elements will make the array stop being beautiful.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
