Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of at least `i+2` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 2 or 3, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `i` is `i+1`, and `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
