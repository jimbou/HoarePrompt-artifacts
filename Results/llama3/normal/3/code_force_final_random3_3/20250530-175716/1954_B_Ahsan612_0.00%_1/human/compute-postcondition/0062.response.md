Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the integer at index i+1 in ar, i is i+1, minn is min(infinity, 1), stdin contains t - 3 test cases**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, updates `num` to be the integer at the new index `i` in the list `ar`, assigns the minimum value between `minn` (which is infinity) and `same` (which is 1) to `minn`, and resets `same` to 1. The value of `n` and the contents of the list `ar` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t - 3 test cases.
