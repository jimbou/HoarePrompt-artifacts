Output State: **n is an integer between 6 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, i is either 5 or 6, num is either the fourth or fifth integer in ar, same is 1, minn is either 1 or the minimum of the first integer in ar and 1, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 6 and 3 * 10^5. The list `ar` also remains unchanged, containing `n` integers between 1 and `n`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 5 or 6, depending on its initial value. The variable `num` now holds the value of the fourth or fifth integer in the list `ar`, depending on the initial value of `i`. The variable `same` has been reset to 1. The variable `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and 1. Finally, the number of test cases in stdin remains unchanged, still containing `t - 1` test cases.
