The code prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list `ar`. This minimum number is either the previously calculated minimum or 1, whichever is smaller. Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it has a finite value. However, without knowing the exact elements in `ar`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `minn`.

Output: **the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list ar (which is either the previously calculated minimum or 1, whichever is smaller)**
