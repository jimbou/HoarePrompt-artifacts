Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of at least i+2 integers between 1 and n, i is less than len(ar), num is the integer at index i in ar, minn is min(infinity, 1) or min(infinity, 2) or min(infinity, 3), same is 1.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `ar` also remains the same, with at least `i+2` integers between 1 and `n`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now less than `len(ar)`. The value of `num` is updated to the integer at index `i` in `ar`. The variable `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `same`, which can be 1, 2, or 3. Finally, the variable `same` is reset to 1.
