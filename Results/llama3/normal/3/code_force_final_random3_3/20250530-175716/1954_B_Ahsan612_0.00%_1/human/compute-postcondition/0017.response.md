Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `i+2`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first integer in `ar`, the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, or the integer in `ar` at index `i`, `minn` is either 1 or positive infinity, `i` is either 3, 4, 5, or `i+3`, and `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, with `t` being greater than 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or `i+3`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer in `ar` at index `i`, and `i` is either 4, 5, or `i+3`.**
