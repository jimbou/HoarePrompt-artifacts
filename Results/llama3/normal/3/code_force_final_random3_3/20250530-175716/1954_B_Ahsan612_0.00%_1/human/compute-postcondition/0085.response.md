Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list and prints this minimum value. If no such minimum value exists (i.e., all integers in the list appear only once), it prints -1. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.**
