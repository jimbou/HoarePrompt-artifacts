Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the second integer in ar, i is 2, minn is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 2. Then, it assigns the value of the second integer in the list `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (infinity) and the value of `same` (1), resulting in `minn` becoming 1. Finally, the value of `same` is reset to 1.
