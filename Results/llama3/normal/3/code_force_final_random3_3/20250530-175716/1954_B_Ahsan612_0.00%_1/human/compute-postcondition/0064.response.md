Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to the current value of `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `i` is `i+1`, and `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `same` is still dependent on whether the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to the current value of `num`. The value of `num` is still the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`. The value of `minn` is still `min(infinity, 1)`.
