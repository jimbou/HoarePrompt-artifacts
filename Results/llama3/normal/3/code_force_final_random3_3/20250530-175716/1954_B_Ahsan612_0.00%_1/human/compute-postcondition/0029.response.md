Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, i is 1, minn is infinity, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n, which is between 1 and 3 * 10^5. Then, it reads a list of n integers from stdin and assigns it to ar. The list contains integers between 1 and n. The variable same is initialized to 1, and num is assigned the value of the first integer in ar. The variable minn is set to infinity, and i is set to 1. The code does not modify the value of t, so stdin still contains t - 1 test cases.
