Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of at least `i+2` integers between 1 and `n`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 or 3, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `i` is `i+1`, and `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `i` is `i+2`, and `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)` or `min(infinity, 2)`.***
