Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only one distinct element. In this case, the program will print the length of the array, but it should print -1 because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

For example, if the input is:

1
5
1 1 1 1 1

The program will print 1, but the correct output should be -1.

The issue is that the program does not handle the case when the input array has only one distinct element correctly. It should check if the array has only one distinct element and print -1 in this case.
