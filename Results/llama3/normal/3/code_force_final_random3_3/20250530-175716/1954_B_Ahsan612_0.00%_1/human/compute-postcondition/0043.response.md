Output State: **`n` is an integer between 6 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 4, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, and `minn` is infinity. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then if the first integer in `ar` is equal to the second integer in `ar`, `i` is 4, `num` is the third integer in `ar`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 5, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is the minimum of the first integer in `ar` and 1. In both cases, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the values of `same`, `num`, `i`, and `minn` are updated accordingly.
