Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, t is greater than 0**

The code executes as follows:

*   The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.
*   The second line reads `n` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to `ar`. This empties stdin of the current test case.
*   The third line assigns 1 to `same`.
*   The fourth line assigns the first integer in `ar` to `num`.
*   The fifth line assigns positive infinity to `minn`.
*   The sixth line assigns 1 to `i`.

After executing the code, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 \* 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, and stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.
