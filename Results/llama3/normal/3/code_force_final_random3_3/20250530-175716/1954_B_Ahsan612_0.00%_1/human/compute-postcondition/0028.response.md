State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is either 1 or the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in ar, num is the last integer in ar, i is equal to n, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, t is greater than 1. If minn is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, minn, which is the minimum of minn and same, is printed.**
