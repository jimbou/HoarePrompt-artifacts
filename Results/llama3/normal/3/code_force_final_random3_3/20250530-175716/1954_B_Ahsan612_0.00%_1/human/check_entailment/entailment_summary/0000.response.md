Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful. 

The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the current number and the count of consecutive occurrences of that number. Whenever it encounters a different number, it updates the minimum count if necessary. 

The program handles the edge case where all numbers in the array are the same by initializing the minimum count to infinity and only updating it when it encounters a different number. If the minimum count remains infinity at the end, it means all numbers in the array are the same, and the program correctly prints -1.

Correctness: **True**
