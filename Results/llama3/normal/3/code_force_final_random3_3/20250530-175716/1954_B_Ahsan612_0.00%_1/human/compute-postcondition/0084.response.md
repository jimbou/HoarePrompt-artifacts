Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar` and 1. If `minn` is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar` which is `minn` is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all the test cases, and the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list `ar` has been found and printed. The loop has iterated over all the test cases, and the variables `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `i` have been updated accordingly. The variable `minn` now holds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar`, and if it is infinity, -1 is printed, indicating that there are no consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar`.
