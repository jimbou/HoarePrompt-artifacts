Output State: **n is greater than i+2, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the integer in ar at index i, minn is either 1 or positive infinity, i is either 4, 5 or i+3, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, t is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `num` has been updated to the integer in `ar` at index `i`. The value of `minn` has been updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, which is either 1 or positive infinity. The value of `same` has been reset to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
