Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the integer in `ar` at index `i+2`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or `i+2`. The value of `num` is updated to the integer in `ar` at index `i+2` if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `same` is 1 in this case. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
