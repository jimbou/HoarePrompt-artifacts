Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `n`, `minn` is the minimum of 1 and the minimum of all the sequences of consecutive equal integers in `ar`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. The current value of `minn` is infinity, and -1 is being printed**
