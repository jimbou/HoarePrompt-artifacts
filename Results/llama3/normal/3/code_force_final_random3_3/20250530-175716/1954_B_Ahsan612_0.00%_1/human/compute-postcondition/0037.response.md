To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `ar` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 or 3, and `n` (which is equal to `len(ar)`) is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is 2 or 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 2 or 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 or 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is infinity. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1. In both cases, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**
