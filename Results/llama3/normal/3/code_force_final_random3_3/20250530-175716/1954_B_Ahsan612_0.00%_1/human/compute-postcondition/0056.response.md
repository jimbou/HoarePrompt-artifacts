The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t` from the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain `t - 2` test cases and `t` is greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `n`, `minn` is the minimum of 1 and the minimum of all the sequences of consecutive equal integers in `ar`, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases. If `minn` is infinity, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the minimum of 1 and the minimum of all the sequences of consecutive equal integers in `ar`, which is `minn`.**
