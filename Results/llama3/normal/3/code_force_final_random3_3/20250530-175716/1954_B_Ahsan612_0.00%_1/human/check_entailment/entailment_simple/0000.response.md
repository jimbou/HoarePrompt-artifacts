Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the number of consecutive occurrences of each integer. It updates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences found so far.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only checks for consecutive occurrences of integers, but it does not consider the case where an integer is surrounded by the same integer on both sides, which is a necessary condition for the array to be beautiful.

For example, in the array [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the program will correctly identify the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of each integer as 1. However, it will not consider the fact that the integer 2 is surrounded by the same integer 1 on both sides, which makes the array beautiful.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
