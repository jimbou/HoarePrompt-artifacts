Output State: **n is an integer between 4 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, i is 3 if the first integer in ar is equal to the second integer in ar, otherwise i is 4, num is the third integer in ar if the first integer in ar is equal to the second integer in ar, otherwise num is the fourth integer in ar, same is 1, minn is 1 if the first integer in ar is equal to the second integer in ar, otherwise minn is the minimum of the first integer in ar and 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

Explanation:
The first line increments `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 3 if the first integer in `ar` is equal to the second integer in `ar`, otherwise `i` becomes 4.
The second line assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`, so `num` becomes the third integer in `ar` if the first integer in `ar` is equal to the second integer in `ar`, otherwise `num` becomes the fourth integer in `ar`.
The third line assigns the minimum value between `minn` and `same` to `minn`, so `minn` becomes 1 if the first integer in `ar` is equal to the second integer in `ar`, otherwise `minn` becomes the minimum of the first integer in `ar` and 1.
The fourth line assigns 1 to `same`, so `same` becomes 1.
The values of `n`, `ar`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
