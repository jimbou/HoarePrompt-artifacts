Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of at least i+2 integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the integer at index i in ar, i is i+2, and minn is min(infinity, 1) or min(infinity, 2).**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `ar` also remains unchanged, but the index `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i+2`. The value of `num` is updated to the integer at index `i` in `ar`, which is the new value of `i` after the increment. The variable `same` is reset to 1, and `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (either 1 or infinity) and the value of `same` before it was reset, which is either 1 or 2.
