The only variable in the loop head is variable i and len(ar), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and len(ar). If i is less than len(ar), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, i is 1, len(ar) is n, and n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. n being an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 does ensure that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, i is 1, minn is infinity, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**
