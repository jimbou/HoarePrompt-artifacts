Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, t is greater than 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the integer in `ar` at index `i+2`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than `i+1`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2 or 3, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, `minn` is either 1 or positive infinity, `i` is either 3, 4 or `i+3`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or `i+3`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than `i+2`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first integer in `ar`, the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, or the integer in `ar` at index `i`, `minn` is either 1 or positive infinity, `i` is either 4, 5, 6, or `i+3`, and `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, with `t` being greater than 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or `i+3`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer in `ar` at index `i`, and `i` is either 4, 5, or `i+3`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
