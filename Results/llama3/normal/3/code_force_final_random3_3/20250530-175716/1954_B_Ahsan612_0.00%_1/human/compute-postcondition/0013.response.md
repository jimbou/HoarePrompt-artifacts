Output State: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2 or 3, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, `minn` is either 1 or positive infinity, `i` is either 3, 4 or `i+3`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or `i+3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships and constraints have been updated accordingly. The list `ar` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `num` is still either the first integer in `ar` or the integer at index `i+1`. The value of `same` depends on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, and `minn` is still either 1 or positive infinity. The value of `i` is now either 3, 4, or `i+3`, and there are still `t - 1` test cases in `stdin`.
