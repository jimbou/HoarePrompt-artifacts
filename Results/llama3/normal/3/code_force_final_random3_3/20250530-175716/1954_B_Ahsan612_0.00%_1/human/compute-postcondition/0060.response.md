Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 2, num is the first integer in ar, i is 1, minn is infinity, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, and the current value of ar[i] is equal to the current value of num.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true in the initial state are still true. The value of `ar[i]` is still equal to the value of `num`, and `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains t - 3 test cases.
