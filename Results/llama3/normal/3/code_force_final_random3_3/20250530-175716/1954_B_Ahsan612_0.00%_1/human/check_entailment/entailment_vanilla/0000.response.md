Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.

3. It initializes variables `same` to 1 (to count the number of consecutive elements with the same value) and `num` to the first element of the array.

4. It then iterates over the array, comparing each element with the current `num`. If they are the same, it increments `same`. If they are different, it updates `num` to the current element and updates `minn` (the minimum count of consecutive elements with the same value) if necessary.

5. After the loop, it updates `minn` one more time with the last count of consecutive elements with the same value.

6. If `minn` is still infinity, it means that all elements in the array are the same, so it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
