According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i+1`, `ar` is a list of at least `i+1` integers between 1 and `n`. `i` being `i+1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `len(ar)`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of at least `i+2` integers between 1 and `n`. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 or 3, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)` or `min(infinity, 2)`, and `i` is less than `len(ar)`**
