Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is either 1 or the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in ar, num is the last integer in ar, minn is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in ar, i is equal to n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, t is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it has iterated over the entire list `ar`. At the end of the loop, `same` will be either 1 or the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in `ar`, depending on whether the last integer in `ar` is the same as the previous one. `num` will be the last integer in `ar`, and `minn` will be the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in `ar`. The value of `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire list. The values of `stdin` and `t` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
