Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of at least `i+1` integers between 1 and `n`. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 or 3, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i-1` in `ar`, `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)` or `min(infinity, 2)`, and `i` is `i+1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but their values are now based on the new value of `i`. The list `ar` still contains at least `i+1` integers between 1 and `n`, but the index `i` now points to the next element in the list. The values of `same`, `num`, and `minn` are updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`.
