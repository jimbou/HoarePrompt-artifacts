Output State: **`n` is greater than `i+2`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 2, 3 or 4, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, `minn` is either 1 or positive infinity, `i` is either 3, 4 or `i+3`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or `i+3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `same` can now be either 2, 3, or 4. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or `i+3`. The list `ar`, the number of test cases `t`, and the input in `stdin` remain unchanged.
