The code prints the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, where `same` is either 1 or the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in the list `ar`. Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it has a finite value.

Output: **the minimum of minn and same (where same is either 1 or the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in the list ar)**
