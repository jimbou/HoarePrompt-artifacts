Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `i` is 1, `minn` is infinity, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `same` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases, and the current value of `ar[i]` remains equal to `num`.
