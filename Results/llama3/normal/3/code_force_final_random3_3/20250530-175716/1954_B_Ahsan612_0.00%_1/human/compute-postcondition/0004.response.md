Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `same` being equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
