Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is either 1 or the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of an integer in ar, num is the last integer in ar, minn is the minimum of minn and same, i is equal to n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, t is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of minn has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of same. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t - 1 test cases, and t is still greater than 0.
