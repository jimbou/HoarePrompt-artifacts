Output State: **`n` is greater than `i+2`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first integer in `ar`, the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, or the integer in `ar` at index `i`, `minn` is either 1 or positive infinity, `i` is either 4, 5, 6, or `i+3`, and `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, with `t` being greater than 0. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or `i+3`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer in `ar` at index `i`, and `i` is either 4, 5, or `i+3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than `i+2`. The list `ar` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`. The value of `same` can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The value of `num` can be the first integer in `ar`, the integer in `ar` at index `i+1`, or the integer in `ar` at index `i`. The value of `minn` can be 1 or positive infinity. The value of `i` can be 4, 5, 6, or `i+3`. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases, with `t` being greater than 0. The conditions related to `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i]` being equal to `num` still apply.
