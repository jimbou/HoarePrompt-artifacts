Output State: **n is greater than i+1, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the integer in ar at index i, minn is 1, i is either 3 or i+3, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, t is greater than 0**

The code block increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 3 or `i+3`. It then assigns the integer at index `i` in the list `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (positive infinity) and `same` (either 1 or 2), resulting in `minn` becoming 1. Finally, the value of `same` is set to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `t` remain unchanged.
