Output State: **`n` is greater than `i+2`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is either 2 or `i+2`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0**

The code increments the value of `same` by 1. The initial value of `same` was either 1 or 2, so after the increment, it becomes either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
