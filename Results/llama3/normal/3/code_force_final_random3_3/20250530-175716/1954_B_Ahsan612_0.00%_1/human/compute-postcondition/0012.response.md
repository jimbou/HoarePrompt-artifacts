Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i+2`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2 or 3, `num` is either the first integer in `ar` or the integer in `ar` at index `i+2`, `minn` is either 1 or positive infinity, `i` is either 2, 3 or `i+2` or `i+3`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `i` is either 3 or `i+3`.***
