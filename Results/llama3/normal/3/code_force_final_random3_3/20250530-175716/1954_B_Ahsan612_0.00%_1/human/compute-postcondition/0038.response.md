Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is infinity. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1. In both cases, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the values of `same`, `num`, `i`, and `minn` are still dependent on whether the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.
