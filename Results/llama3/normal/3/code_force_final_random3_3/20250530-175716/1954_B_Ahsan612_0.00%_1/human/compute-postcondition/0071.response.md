Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of at least `i+2` integers between 1 and `n`. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 or 4, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)`. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is `min(infinity, 1)` or `min(infinity, 2)`, and `i` is less than `len(ar)`**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now 3 or 4, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
