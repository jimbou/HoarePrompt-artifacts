The code increments the total cost by the cost to change at position `v`. The current position is still na_frente - 2. The best cost is still updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v` if it is greater than the current best cost.

Output State: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and the best cost accordingly. The current position is still na_frente - 2. If the current best cost is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, the best cost is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`.**
