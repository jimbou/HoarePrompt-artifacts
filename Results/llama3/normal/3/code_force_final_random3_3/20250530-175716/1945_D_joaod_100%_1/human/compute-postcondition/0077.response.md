Postcondition: ***The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is na_frente - 2. If custo_pra_trocar_a[v] is less than custo_pra_passar_b[v], the total cost is updated to total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and the best cost remains the same as it was before, which is either the previous best cost or total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] if the current best cost was greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position v. Otherwise, the total cost is updated to total + custo_pra_passar_b[v] and the best cost is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position v if the current best cost is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position v.***
