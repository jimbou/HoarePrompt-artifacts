Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, `best` is the maximum float value, and `best` is printed, where `best` is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from `na_frente` to `pos_final` plus the total cost to change or pass from `na_frente` to that position, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the cost to change to A at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass from B at position `v`, stdin contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases, the value of c, the value of na_frente, the value of pos_final, the lists of costs to change to A and pass from B, and the remaining input for the remaining test cases remain the same. The value of v is still equal to na_frente. The total cost is now equal to the cost to pass from B at position na_frente. The best cost is still the maximum float value and is printed. The relationship between v, pos_final, and the costs at position v remains the same.
