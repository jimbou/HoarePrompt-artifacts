Output State: **The current position is still -1, the total cost is now the previous total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `v`, the number of the last test case processed is still c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`. If the best cost is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `v`, then the best cost is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost to change `a` at the current position `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
