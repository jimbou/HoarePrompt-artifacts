Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `total` is increased by the cost to pass to B at position `v`, `best` is sys.float_info.max, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to change to A at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass to B at position `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to pass to B at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true.
