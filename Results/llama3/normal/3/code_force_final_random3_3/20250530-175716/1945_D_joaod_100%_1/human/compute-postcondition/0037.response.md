Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the value of c is still 0, the value of na_frente is still greater than or equal to 0 and is equal to the first input minus 1, the value of pos_final is still equal to the second input minus 1, the lists custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b still contain n integers, the remaining input for the remaining test cases is still in stdin, the value of v is still -1, and the value of total has been increased by the last element of the list custo_pra_passar_b.
