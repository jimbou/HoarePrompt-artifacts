Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is equal to `na_frente` - 1, `best` is equal to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been calculated by adding `total` and the element at index `na_frente - 1` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
