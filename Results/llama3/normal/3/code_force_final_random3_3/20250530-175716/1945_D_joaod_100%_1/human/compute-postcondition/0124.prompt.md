Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The current position is -1. The total cost is 0. The best cost is the maximum possible floating point value. The number of the last test case processed is c-1. The values of na_frente and pos_final are the input values minus 1. The lists custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b contain the input values. Stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The current position is still -1, the total cost is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change `a` at position `v` and the cost to pass `b` at position `v`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the total cost is increased by the minimum of the cost to change `a` at position `v` and the cost to pass `b` at position `v`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, the total cost is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, whichever is smaller. The number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. If the best cost is greater than the updated total cost, the best cost is updated to the total cost.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The current position is still -1, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the total cost is updated by adding the cost to change `a` at position `na_frente` if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, otherwise the total cost is updated by adding the cost to pass `b` at position `na_frente`. If the best cost is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `v`, then `best` is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `na_frente`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, the total cost is updated by adding the minimum cost between changing `a` at position `na_frente` and passing `b` at position `na_frente`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The current position is still -1, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `na_frente - 1` and `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `na_frente - 1`, and `best` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `na_frente - 1` and `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `na_frente - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
