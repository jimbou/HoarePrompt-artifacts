Output State: **The current position is still -1, the total cost is increased by the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, the best cost is still the maximum possible floating point value, the number of the last test case processed is still c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, `v` is `na_frente` and `v` is larger than `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the total cost has been updated by adding the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
