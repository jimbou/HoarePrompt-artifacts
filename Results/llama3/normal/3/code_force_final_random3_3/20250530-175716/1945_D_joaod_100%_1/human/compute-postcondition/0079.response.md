Output State: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and the best cost accordingly. The current position is still na_frente - 2.**

In this output state, the total cost has been updated by adding the cost of passing through vertex `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) to the previous total cost. The best cost has also been updated accordingly, but its exact value is not specified. The current position remains the same, which is `na_frente - 2`.
