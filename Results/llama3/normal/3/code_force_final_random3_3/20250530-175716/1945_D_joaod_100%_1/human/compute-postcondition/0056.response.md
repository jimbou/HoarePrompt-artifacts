Postcondition: **cases is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, c is 1, na_frente is an integer equal to the first input minus 2 and must be at least 0, pos_final is an integer equal to the second input minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, v is na_frente, total is 0, best is the maximum float value, and best is printed, where best is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position, and v is greater than pos_final. The current value of custo_pra_trocar_a at position v is less than the current value of custo_pra_passar_b at position v.**
