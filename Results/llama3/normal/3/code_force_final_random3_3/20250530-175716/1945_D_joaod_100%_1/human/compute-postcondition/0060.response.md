Postcondition: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. If the cost to change to A at the current position is less than the cost to pass from B, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the current cost to change to A and the previous total cost. Otherwise, the total cost is updated to be the cost to pass from B at the current position. The best cost is updated to be the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position. The program then moves on to the next position, with v being greater than pos_final.**
