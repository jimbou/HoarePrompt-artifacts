Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the last element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, and if it is greater than the updated `total` plus the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` will be updated accordingly.
