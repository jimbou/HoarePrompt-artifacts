Postcondition: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is na_frente - 1. If the current position is less than or equal to the final position, the total cost and best cost are updated based on the cost to change to A at the current position and the cost to pass from B. If the cost to change to A is less than the cost to pass from B, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to change to A and the previous total cost, and the best cost remains unchanged. Otherwise, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to pass from B and the previous total cost, and the best cost is updated to be the minimum cost to change to A at any position from the initial position to the final position plus the total cost to change or pass from the initial position to that position. If the current best cost is greater than the new total cost plus the cost to change to A at the current position, then the best cost is updated to be the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position. Otherwise, the best cost remains unchanged. If the current position is greater than the final position, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to change to A at the current position and the previous total cost if the cost to change to A is less than the cost to pass from B, otherwise the total cost is updated to be the cost to pass from B at the current position. The best cost is updated to be the minimum cost to change to A at any position from the initial position to the final position plus the total cost to change or pass from the initial position to that position. If the current best cost is greater than the new total cost plus the cost to change to A at the current position, then the best cost is updated to be the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position.**
