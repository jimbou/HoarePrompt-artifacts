Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is equal to `na_frente` - 1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `na_frente - 1`, which is equivalent to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `cases`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` are still valid.
