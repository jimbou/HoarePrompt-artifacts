Output State: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is -1. The total cost is the sum of the minimum cost to change to A or pass from B at each position from na_frente to -1. The best cost is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the program has finished processing the input for the current test case, and the total cost and best cost have been updated accordingly. The current position is -1, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over all positions from na_frente to -1. The total cost is the sum of the minimum cost to change to A or pass from B at each position from na_frente to -1. The best cost is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position.
