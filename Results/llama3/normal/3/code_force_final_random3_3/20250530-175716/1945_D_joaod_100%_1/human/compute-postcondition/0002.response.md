Output State: **cases is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, c is 0, na_frente is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, pos_final is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n integers, total is 0, best is sys.float_info.max, stdin contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `c` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1 from their original input values. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are populated with the input values. The variables `total` and `best` are initialized to 0 and `sys.float_info.max`, respectively. The stdin now contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases.
