Output State: **The current position is -1. The total cost is 0. The best cost is the maximum possible floating point value. The number of the last test case processed is c-1. The values of na_frente and pos_final are the input values minus 1. The lists custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b contain the input values. Stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the current position remains unchanged at -1. The total cost is reset to 0, and the best cost is set to the maximum possible floating point value. The value of c remains the same, representing the number of the last test case processed plus 1. The values of na_frente and pos_final are updated to be one less than the input values. The lists custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b are populated with the input values. Finally, stdin is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
