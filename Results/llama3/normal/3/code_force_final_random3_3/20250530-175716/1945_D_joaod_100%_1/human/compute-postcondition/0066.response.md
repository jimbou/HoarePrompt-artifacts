Output State: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is na_frente - 1. The total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to pass from B at the current position and the previous total cost. The best cost is updated to be the minimum cost to change to A at any position from the initial position to the final position plus the total cost to change or pass from the initial position to that position. If the current best cost is greater than the new total cost plus the cost to change to A at the current position, then the best cost is updated to be the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position. Otherwise, the best cost remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the total cost has been updated to include the cost to pass from B at the current position, and the best cost has been updated accordingly based on the comparison with the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position. The current position remains at na_frente - 1.
