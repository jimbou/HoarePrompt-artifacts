Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `total` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and its current value is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at the current position, then the best value is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at the current position. Otherwise, the best value remains unchanged.***
