Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining input for the first test case (two lines: n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) and the remaining test cases.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cases is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, c is 0, na_frente is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, pos_final is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum cost between changing and passing at each position from na_frente to -1, best is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position, and best is printed, where best is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is -1. The total cost is the sum of the minimum cost to change to A or pass from B at each position from na_frente to -1. The best cost is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position, and the best cost is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The current position is still -1. The total cost is the sum of the minimum costs between changing `a` and passing `b` at each position from `na_frente` to 0. The best cost is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`. The number of the last test case processed remains c-1. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the input values minus 1. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values. Stdin is empty, and the best cost is printed, which is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
