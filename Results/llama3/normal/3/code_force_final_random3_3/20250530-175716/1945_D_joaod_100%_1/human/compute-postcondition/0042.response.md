Output: **cases is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, c is 0, na_frente is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, pos_final is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum cost between changing and passing at each position from na_frente to -1, best is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position, and best is printed, where best is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position**
