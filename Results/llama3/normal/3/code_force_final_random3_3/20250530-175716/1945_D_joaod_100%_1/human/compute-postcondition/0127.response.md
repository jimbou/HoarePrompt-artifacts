Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The current position is -1. The total cost is the sum of the minimum costs between changing `a` and passing `b` at each position from `na_frente` to 0. The best cost is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`. The number of the last test case processed is `cases-1`. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the input values minus 1. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values. Stdin is empty, and the best cost is printed, which is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, processing all test cases. The current position is at the end of the input, and the total cost and best cost have been calculated and printed for each test case. The input has been fully consumed, and the program has finished executing.
