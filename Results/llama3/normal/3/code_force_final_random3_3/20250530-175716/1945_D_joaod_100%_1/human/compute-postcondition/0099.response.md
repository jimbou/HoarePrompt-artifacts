Output State: **The current position is still -1, the total cost is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, the best cost is still the maximum possible floating point value, the number of the last test case processed is still c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is still the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, `v` is `na_frente` and `v` is larger than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has increased by the cost of changing at the current position `v`, which is less than the cost of passing at the same position. All other variables remain unchanged.
