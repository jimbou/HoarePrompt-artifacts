Output State: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is less than or equal to the final position, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to change to A at the current position and the previous total cost if the cost to change to A at the current position is less than the cost to pass from B, otherwise the total cost is updated to be the cost to pass from B at the current position. The best cost is updated to be the minimum of the current best cost and the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position. The program then moves on to the next position. The current position is na_frente - 1.**

In natural language, the output state means that the program has updated the best cost to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position. All other conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state.
