Postcondition: **The current position is still -1, the total cost is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change `a` at position `v` and the cost to pass `b` at position `v`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the total cost is increased by the minimum of the cost to change `a` at position `v` and the cost to pass `b` at position `v`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, the total cost is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, whichever is smaller. The number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. If the best cost is greater than the updated total cost, the best cost is updated to the total cost.**
