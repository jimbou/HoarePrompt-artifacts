Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `total` is equal to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` plus the previous value of `total`, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and its current value is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at the current position, then the best value is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at the current position. Otherwise, the best value remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases, the value of `c`, the value of `na_frente`, the value of `pos_final`, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, and the remaining input in `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `total` is increased by the cost to change at the current position `v`, which is equal to `na_frente`. The relationship between the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` remains the same, and the best value is updated or remains unchanged based on the comparison with the total cost plus the cost to change at the current position.
