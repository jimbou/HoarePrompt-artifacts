Output State: **The current position is still -1, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, and `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The current position remains unchanged at -1, and the last test case processed is still c-1. The value of `na_frente` is at least 0, and `pos_final` is still the input value minus 1. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` still contain the input values. Stdin is still empty. The value of `v` is still `na_frente - 1`. The only change is that the value of `total` has been increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `na_frente - 1`.
