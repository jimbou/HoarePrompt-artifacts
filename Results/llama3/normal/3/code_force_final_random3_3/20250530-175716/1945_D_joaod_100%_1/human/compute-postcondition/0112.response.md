Postcondition: ***The current position is still -1, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. The total cost is updated by adding the minimum cost between changing `a` at position `na_frente` and passing `b` at position `na_frente`.***
