Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines of input: two integers n and m, and two lists of n integers each. It then calculates the minimum total cost to move from position n-1 to position 0, considering the costs of changing 'a' and passing 'b' at each position. The function prints the minimum total cost plus the cost to change 'a' at each position from n-1 to m-1 for each test case.**
