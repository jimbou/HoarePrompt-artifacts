Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost for Kirill to move from the end of the line to a position among the first m people in line.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of people in the queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and the two lists of integers (a and b).

2. It initializes the variables correctly, including the total cost (total) and the best cost (best).

3. The program iterates over the positions in the queue from n-1 to 0. For each position, it checks if the current position is within the allowable final position (m). If it is, it updates the best cost if the current total cost plus the cost to change 'a' at the current position is less than the current best cost.

4. The program also updates the total cost by adding the minimum cost between changing 'a' and passing 'b' at the current position.

5. After iterating over all positions, the program prints the best cost, which is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change 'a' at each position from n-1 to m-1.

6. The program handles the edge cases correctly, including when the input values are at their minimum or maximum allowed values.

7. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
