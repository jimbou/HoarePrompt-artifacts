Postcondition: **The current position is still -1, the total cost is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change `a` at position `v` and the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. If the best cost is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `v`, then `best` is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `na_frente`.**
