The only variable in the loop head is variable `v`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and `na_frente`. If `v` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, so for the loop to execute again `v` must be `na_frente - 2`.
State: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is na_frente - 2.**
