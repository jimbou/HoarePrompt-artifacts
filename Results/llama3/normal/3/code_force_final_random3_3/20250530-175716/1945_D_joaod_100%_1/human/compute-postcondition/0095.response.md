Output State: **The current position is still -1, the total cost is increased by the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, the number of the last test case processed is still c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The cost to change `a` at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.**

In this output state, the total cost has been updated by adding the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The current position is still -1, indicating that no position has been changed. The number of the last test case processed is still c-1, and `na_frente` is at least 0. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` still contain the input values, and Stdin is empty. The value of `v` is still `na_frente`, and it is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The cost to change `a` at position `v` is still greater than or equal to the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.
