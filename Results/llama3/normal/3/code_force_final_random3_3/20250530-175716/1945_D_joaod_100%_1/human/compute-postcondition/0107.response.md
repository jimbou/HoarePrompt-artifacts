Output State: **The current position is still -1, the total cost is updated by adding the cost to change `a` at position `na_frente`, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. If the best cost is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `v`, then `best` is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `na_frente`.**

In this output state, the total cost has been updated by adding the cost to change `a` at position `na_frente`, which is the current value of `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The best cost is updated only if it is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change `a` at position `na_frente`.
