Output: **The current position is still -1. The total cost is the sum of the minimum costs between changing `a` and passing `b` at each position from `na_frente` to 0. The best cost is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`. The number of the last test case processed remains c-1. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the input values minus 1. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values. Stdin is empty, and the best cost is printed, which is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`.**
