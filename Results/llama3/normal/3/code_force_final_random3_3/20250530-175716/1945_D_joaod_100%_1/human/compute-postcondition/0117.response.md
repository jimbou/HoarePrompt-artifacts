Output State: **The current position is still -1, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, and `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`. If `best` is greater than the new `total`, then `best` remains the same; otherwise, `best` is updated to the new `total`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still dependent on the comparison between `best` and the new `total`.
