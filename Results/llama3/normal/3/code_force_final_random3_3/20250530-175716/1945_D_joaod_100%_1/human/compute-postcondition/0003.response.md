To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `v` and the integer `na_frente`. The loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `na_frente` is already defined as an integer equal to the first input minus 1, we can infer that the first input must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `v` will start at `na_frente` and decrement by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `total` is 0, `best` is sys.float_info.max, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is equal to `na_frente`**
