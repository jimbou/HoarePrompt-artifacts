Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is the sum of the cost to pass at position `na_frente` and the previous total, `best` is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from `na_frente` to `pos_final` plus the total cost to change or pass from `na_frente` to that position, and `best` is printed, stdin contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to include the cost to pass at the current position `v`, which is equal to `na_frente`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true. The value of `best` is still the minimum cost to change to A at any position from `na_frente` to `pos_final` plus the total cost to change or pass from `na_frente` to that position, and it has been printed. The stdin still contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases.
