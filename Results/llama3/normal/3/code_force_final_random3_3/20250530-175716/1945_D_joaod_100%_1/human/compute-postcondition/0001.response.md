The only variable in the loop head is variable `c` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining input for the first test case (two lines: n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) and the remaining test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `cases` must be greater than 0 and `c` is now 0.
State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains the remaining input for the first test case (two lines: n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) and the remaining test cases, `c` is 0**
