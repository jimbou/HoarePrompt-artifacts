Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people in the queue.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of people in the queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and the two lists of integers representing the costs of changing 'a' and passing 'b' at each position.
2.  The program initializes the `total` variable to 0, which will keep track of the total cost of moving from position n-1 to position 0. It also initializes the `best` variable to a maximum value, which will store the minimum total cost plus the cost to change 'a' at each position from n-1 to m-1.
3.  The program iterates over the positions in the queue from n-1 to 0. For each position, it checks if the current position is less than or equal to the maximum allowable final position (m). If it is, the program updates the `best` variable with the minimum of the current `best` value and the total cost plus the cost to change 'a' at the current position.
4.  The program then checks if the cost to change 'a' at the current position is less than the cost to pass 'b' at the current position. If it is, the program adds the cost to change 'a' to the `total` cost; otherwise, it adds the cost to pass 'b' to the `total` cost.
5.  After iterating over all positions, the program prints the `best` value, which represents the minimum total cost plus the cost to change 'a' at each position from n-1 to m-1.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
