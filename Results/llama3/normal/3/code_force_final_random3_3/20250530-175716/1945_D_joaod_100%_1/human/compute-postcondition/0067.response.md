Postcondition: **The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is na_frente - 1. If the cost to change to A at the current position is less than the cost to pass from B, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to change to A at the current position and the previous total cost, and the best cost remains unchanged. Otherwise, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to pass from B at the current position and the previous total cost, and the best cost is updated to be the minimum cost to change to A at any position from the initial position to the final position plus the total cost to change or pass from the initial position to that position. If the current best cost is greater than the new total cost plus the cost to change to A at the current position, then the best cost is updated to be the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position. Otherwise, the best cost remains unchanged.**
