Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to the first input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n integers, `total` is 0, `best` is equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `stdin` contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and its current value is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is now equal to the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is less than or equal to the original value of `best` since the original value of `best` was greater than the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
