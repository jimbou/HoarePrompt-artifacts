You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200,000). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n separated by spaces (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = sys.float_info.max

            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The current position is -1. The total cost is the sum of the minimum costs between changing `a` and passing `b` at each position from `na_frente` to 0. The best cost is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`. The number of the last test case processed is `cases-1`. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the input values minus 1. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values. Stdin is empty, and the best cost is printed, which is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`.

```

Return Postconditions: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The current position is -1. The total cost is the sum of the minimum costs between changing `a` and passing `b` at each position from `na_frente` to 0. The best cost is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change `a` at each position from `na_frente` to `pos_final`. The number of the last test case processed is `cases-1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
