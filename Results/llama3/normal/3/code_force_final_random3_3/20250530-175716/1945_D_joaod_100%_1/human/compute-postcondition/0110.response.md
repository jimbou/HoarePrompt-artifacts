Output State: **The current position is still -1, the total cost is updated by adding the cost to change `a` at position `na_frente`, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The current position remains unchanged at -1. The total cost is increased by the cost of changing `a` at the current position `na_frente`. The number of the last test case processed remains the same at c-1. The value of `na_frente` is still at least 0. The final position `pos_final` is still the input value minus 1. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` still contain the input values. The standard input is still empty. The value of `v` is still equal to `na_frente`.
