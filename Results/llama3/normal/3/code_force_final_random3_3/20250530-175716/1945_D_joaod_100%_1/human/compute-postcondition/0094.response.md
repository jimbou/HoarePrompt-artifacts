Postcondition: ***The current position is -1, the total cost is 0, the number of the last test case processed is c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, and `v` is `na_frente`. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The cost to change `a` at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.***
