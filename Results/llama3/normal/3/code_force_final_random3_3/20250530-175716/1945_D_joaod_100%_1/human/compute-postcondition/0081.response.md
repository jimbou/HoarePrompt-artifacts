Postcondition: ***The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is na_frente - 2. If v is less than or equal to pos_final, the total cost and best cost are updated based on the comparison of custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and custo_pra_passar_b[v]. If custo_pra_trocar_a[v] is less than custo_pra_passar_b[v], the total cost is updated to total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and the best cost remains the same or is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position v if the current best cost was greater. Otherwise, the total cost is updated to total + custo_pra_passar_b[v] and the best cost is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position v if the current best cost is greater. If v is greater than pos_final, the total cost is updated to total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] is less than custo_pra_passar_b[v], otherwise it is updated to total + custo_pra_passar_b[v], and the best cost is updated accordingly.***
