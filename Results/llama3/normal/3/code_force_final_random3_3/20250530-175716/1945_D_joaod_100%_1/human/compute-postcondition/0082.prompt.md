Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, c is 1, na_frente is an integer equal to the first input minus 2 and must be greater than or equal to -1, pos_final is an integer equal to the second input minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, v is -1, total is 0, best is the maximum float value, and best is printed, where best is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. If the current position is less than or equal to the final position, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to change to A at the current position and the previous total cost if the cost to change to A at the current position is less than the cost to pass from B, otherwise the total cost is updated to be the cost to pass from B at the current position. The best cost is updated to be the minimum cost to change to A at any position from the initial position to the final position plus the total cost to change or pass from the initial position to that position. If the current best cost is greater than the new total cost plus the cost to change to A at the current position, then the best cost is updated to be the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position. The program then moves on to the next position. If the current position is greater than the final position, the program has finished processing the input for the current test case and the best cost is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is na_frente - 1. If the current position is less than or equal to the final position, the total cost and best cost are updated based on the cost to change to A at the current position and the cost to pass from B. If the cost to change to A is less than the cost to pass from B, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to change to A and the previous total cost, and the best cost remains unchanged. Otherwise, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to pass from B and the previous total cost, and the best cost is updated to be the minimum cost to change to A at any position from the initial position to the final position plus the total cost to change or pass from the initial position to that position. If the current best cost is greater than the new total cost plus the cost to change to A at the current position, then the best cost is updated to be the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position. Otherwise, the best cost remains unchanged. If the current position is greater than the final position, the total cost is updated to be the sum of the cost to change to A at the current position and the previous total cost if the cost to change to A is less than the cost to pass from B, otherwise the total cost is updated to be the cost to pass from B at the current position. The best cost is updated to be the minimum cost to change to A at any position from the initial position to the final position plus the total cost to change or pass from the initial position to that position. If the current best cost is greater than the new total cost plus the cost to change to A at the current position, then the best cost is updated to be the sum of the new total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program has processed the input for the current test case, updating the total cost and best cost accordingly. The current position is na_frente - 2. If v is less than or equal to pos_final, the total cost and best cost are updated based on the comparison of custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and custo_pra_passar_b[v]. If custo_pra_trocar_a[v] is less than custo_pra_passar_b[v], the total cost is updated to total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and the best cost remains the same or is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position v if the current best cost was greater. Otherwise, the total cost is updated to total + custo_pra_passar_b[v] and the best cost is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position v if the current best cost is greater. If v is greater than pos_final, the total cost is updated to total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] is less than custo_pra_passar_b[v], otherwise it is updated to total + custo_pra_passar_b[v], and the best cost is updated accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
