The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of three lines of input, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `cases`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining input for the first test case (two lines: n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) and the remaining test cases.**
