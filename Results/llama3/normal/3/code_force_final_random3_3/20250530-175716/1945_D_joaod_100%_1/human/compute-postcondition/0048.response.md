Output State: **cases is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, c is 1, na_frente is an integer equal to the first input minus 2 and must be at least 0, pos_final is an integer equal to the second input minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n integers, stdin contains the remaining input for the remaining test cases, v is na_frente, total is 0, best is the minimum cost to change to A at any position from na_frente to pos_final plus the total cost to change or pass from na_frente to that position, and best is printed, where best is now equal to the sum of total and the cost to change to A at position v. The current value of v is less than or equal to pos_final.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases, the value of c, the initial position na_frente, the final position pos_final, the lists of costs to change to A and to pass through B, and the remaining input in stdin remain unchanged. The current position v is still at the initial position na_frente. The total cost is still 0. The best cost is now updated to be the sum of the total cost and the cost to change to A at the current position v. The best cost is printed. The current position v is still less than or equal to the final position pos_final.
