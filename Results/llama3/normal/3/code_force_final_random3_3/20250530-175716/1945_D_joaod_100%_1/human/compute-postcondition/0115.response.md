Output State: **The current position is still -1, the number of the last test case processed remains c-1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the input value minus 1, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` contain the input values, Stdin is empty, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, and `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The current position remains unchanged at -1, and the last test case processed is still c-1. The value of `na_frente` is at least 0, and `pos_final` is still the input value minus 1. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` still contain the input values, and Stdin is still empty. The value of `v` is still `na_frente - 1`. A new variable `best` has been introduced, which is the sum of `total` and the value at index `na_frente - 1` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
