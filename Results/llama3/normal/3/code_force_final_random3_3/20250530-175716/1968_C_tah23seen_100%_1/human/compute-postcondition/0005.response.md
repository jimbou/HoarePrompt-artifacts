To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 4`. Since `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 500`, `n - 4` can be less than 0 if `n` is less than 4. However, since `n` is at least 3, `n - 4` can be -1 at worst. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 4 <= n <= 500, 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n - 2] is ans[n - 1] - arr[n - 2], ans[n - 3] is ans[n - 2] - arr[n - 3], and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is n - 4**
