Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a greedy approach. The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to `10**9`. Then, it iterates over the input array `arr` from the end to the beginning, and for each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `ans[i]` as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This is based on the observation that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` implies `a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i` (since `a_i` and `a_{i-1}` are both positive and `x_i` is the remainder of `a_i` divided by `a_{i-1}`).

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement requires that `1 <= a_i <= 10**9` for all `i`, but the calculated `ans[i]` values can be negative or exceed `10**9`. For example, if `arr = [2, 4, 1]`, the calculated `ans` array would be `[7, 9, 10**9]`, which does not satisfy the condition `1 <= a_i <= 10**9` for all `i`.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, the input array `arr` is empty, and the program should output a single element `a_1` that satisfies the condition `1 <= a_1 <= 10**9`. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
