#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr.
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: ans is a list of n integers where ans[i] is ans[i + 1] - arr[i] for all i from 0 to n - 2, and ans[n - 1] is 10^9, i is -1
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of n integers where each element at index i (from 0 to n-2) is the difference between the next element in the list and the corresponding element in the input array 'arr', and the last element (at index n-1) is 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of integers where each element at index i (from 0 to n-2) is the difference between the next element in the list and the corresponding element in the input array 'arr', and the last element (at index n-1) is 10^9. It takes a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'n' as input, where n is the length of 'arr' plus one, and returns a list of 'n' integers. The function does not modify the input array 'arr'.
