Functionality: **This function generates a list of integers where each element at index i (from 0 to n-2) is the difference between the next element in the list and the corresponding element in the input array 'arr', and the last element (at index n-1) is 10^9. It takes a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'n' as input, where n is the length of 'arr' plus one, and returns a list of 'n' integers. The function does not modify the input array 'arr'.**
