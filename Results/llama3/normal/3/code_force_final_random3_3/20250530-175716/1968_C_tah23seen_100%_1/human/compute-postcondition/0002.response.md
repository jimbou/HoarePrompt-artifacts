Output State: **arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500, 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n - 2] is ans[n - 1] - arr[n - 2] and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is n - 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans[n - 2]` has been updated to be `ans[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`, and the value of `i` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
