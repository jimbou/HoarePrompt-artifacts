Output State: **arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 3 <= n <= 500, 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n - 2] is ans[n - 1] - arr[n - 2], ans[n - 3] is ans[n - 2] - arr[n - 3], and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is n - 4**

The code modifies the value of `ans[i]` and decrements the value of `i`. The value of `ans[i]` is updated to be `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which means it is now equal to `ans[n - 2] - arr[n - 3]`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 4`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
