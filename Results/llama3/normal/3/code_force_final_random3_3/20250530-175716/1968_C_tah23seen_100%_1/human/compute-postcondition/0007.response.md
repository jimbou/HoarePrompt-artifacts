Output State: **ans is a list of n integers where ans[i] is ans[i + 1] - arr[i] for all i from 0 to n - 2, and ans[n - 1] is 10^9, i is -1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'ans' will contain the cumulative difference of the elements in the list 'arr' from the end to the start, with the last element of 'ans' remaining as 10^9. The variable 'i' will be -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
