According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is n - 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, i must be greater than or equal to 0. Since n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500, n - 3 can be greater than or equal to 0 if n is greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, n must be greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 3 <= n <= 500, 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n - 2] is ans[n - 1] - arr[n - 2] and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is n - 3**
