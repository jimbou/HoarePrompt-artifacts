Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program will output:

999999999 999999997 999999993 999999998

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

For instance, 4 = 999999997 mod 999999999 is not true.

The program's logic is flawed because it simply subtracts the current element from the next element in the array, which does not guarantee that the result will be a valid solution to the problem.

A correct solution would involve finding a way to construct the array a_1, ..., a_n such that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n, which is not achieved by the given program.
