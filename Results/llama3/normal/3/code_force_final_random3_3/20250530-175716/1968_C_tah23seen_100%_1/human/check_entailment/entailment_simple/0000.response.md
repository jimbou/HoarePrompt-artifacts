Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program initializes the `ans` list with `n` elements, all set to `10^9`. This ensures that the last element of the `ans` list is `10^9`, as required by the problem statement.
2.  The program then iterates from the second last element of the `arr` list to the first element (inclusive). For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element in the `ans` list as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`, as required by the problem statement.
3.  The program returns the `ans` list, which contains the required array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

The program correctly implements the required logic and ensures that all conditions specified in the problem statement are met.

Correctness: **True**
