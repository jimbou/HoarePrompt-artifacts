Output State: **arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 4 <= n <= 500, 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr, ans is a list of n integers where ans[n - 2] is ans[n - 1] - arr[n - 2], ans[n - 3] is ans[n - 2] - arr[n - 3], ans[n - 4] is ans[n - 3] - arr[n - 4], and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is n - 5**
