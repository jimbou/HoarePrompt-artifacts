Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^6, done is False, x is the first character of the string s. The count of character x in string s is equal to n - 1. If n is odd and the middle character of string s is not equal to x, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either n is even or the middle character of string s is equal to x, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed.***
