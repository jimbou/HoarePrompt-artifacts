Output State: **'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one part. `done` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The program continues to the next iteration of the loop, and all the previous conditions and variable values remain the same, except that `i` is incremented by 1.
