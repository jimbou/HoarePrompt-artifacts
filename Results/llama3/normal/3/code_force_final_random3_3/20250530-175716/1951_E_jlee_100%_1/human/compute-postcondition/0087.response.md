Postcondition: **The program executes based on the value of count2 relative to count. If count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed along with the number 2, the first j characters of the string, and the rest of the string starting from the jth character, and done is set to True. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed along with the number 2, the first j-1 characters of the string, and the rest of the string starting from the jth character, and done is set to True. If count is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, then done is set to False and count2 is reset to 0. If count2 is greater than count, done is set to True. Otherwise, done remains unchanged.**
