Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is False, `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is equal to `n`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `x` is the first character of `string`. If the count of the first character of the string `x` in the string is equal to `n`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If the count of the first character of the string `x` in the string is equal to `n - 1`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False. `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is greater than 0, and if `count2` is less than `count`, then 2 has been printed. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, then the string has been printed in one or two parts. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `count` is greater than 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then the string has been printed in two parts. Otherwise, the string has been printed in one part. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1 and the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to `x`. If `count` is not greater than 0, then the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False. `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, and the string has been printed in one part. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, then if `count2` is equal to `count`, `count` is 1, and `count2` is 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True, `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, 2 has been printed, the first character of the string has been printed, and the rest of the string has been printed in one part. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 2 and the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to `x`. If `count` is not greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `count` is 1 and `count2` is 2. If `count` is not greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False. `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is 2 and `count2` is 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True. If `count2` is less than `count`, then 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 2. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
