Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is True, `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 1, then `count` is greater than 1 and `count2` is equal to `count`. Otherwise, `count` is 1 and `count2` is 0.***
