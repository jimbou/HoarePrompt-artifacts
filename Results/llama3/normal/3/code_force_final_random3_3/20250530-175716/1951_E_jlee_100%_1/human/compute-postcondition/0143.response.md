Based on the precondition, the code will print 'YES' because the condition for printing 'YES' is met, which is s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j]. The value of j is 2 and the value of n is greater than 2. The value of s[j] and s[n - 1 - j] are not provided, but based on the condition, it is clear that they are not equal.

Output: **YES**
