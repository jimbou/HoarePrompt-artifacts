Postcondition: **The program executes based on the value of `count`. If `count` is greater than 0, the program checks the value of `s[j]` and `x`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, the program prints and updates variables based on the value of `count2` relative to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, the program updates `count2` and checks the value of `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the program prints and sets `done` to True. If `count` is less than 1, the program sets `count` to 2, `count2` to less than or equal to 2, and `done` to True.**
