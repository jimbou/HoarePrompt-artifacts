The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **count is greater than 0, count2 is less than or equal to count, n is greater than 2, and j is 2**
