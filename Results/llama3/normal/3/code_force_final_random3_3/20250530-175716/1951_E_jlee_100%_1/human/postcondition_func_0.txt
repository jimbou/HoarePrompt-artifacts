This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains a string s. It checks if the string can be split into one or two parts such that the resulting parts do not contain the first character of the original string. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES', the number of parts (1 or 2), and the string split into the corresponding number of parts. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all t input strings and prints the results for each string.
