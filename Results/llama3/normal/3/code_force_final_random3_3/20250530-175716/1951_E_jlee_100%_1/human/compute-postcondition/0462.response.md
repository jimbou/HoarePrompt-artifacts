Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True, `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, 2 has been printed, the first character of the string has been printed, and the rest of the string has been printed in one part. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
