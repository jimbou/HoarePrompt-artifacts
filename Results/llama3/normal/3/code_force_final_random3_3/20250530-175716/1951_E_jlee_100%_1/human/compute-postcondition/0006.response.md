Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, the current value of n is 1, and done is False, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. The values of the variables t, i, stdin, string, s, n, and done remain unchanged. The only effect is that the execution of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration, and the loop moves on to the next iteration.
