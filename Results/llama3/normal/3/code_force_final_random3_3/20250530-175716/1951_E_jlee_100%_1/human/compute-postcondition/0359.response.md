Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is False, `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is equal to `n`, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, `count2` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the first character of `string`. If the first character of the string `x` is not equal to the last character of the string `s[-1]`, the string which is a string input from stdin is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
