Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^6, done is False. If n is 1, 'NO' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
