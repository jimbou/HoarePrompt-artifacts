Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the string has been printed in one or two parts, `done` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to the new value of `j`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, no additional changes occur. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `count` is equal to the new value of `j`. Otherwise, `count2` is 0.***
