Postcondition: **'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one part. If `done` is False, 'NO' is being printed, otherwise, no additional action is taken, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, `done` is False. If the length of the string is 1, 'NO' is being printed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If the first character of the string `x` is not equal to the last character of the string `s[-1]`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed in one part, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If the length of the string is odd and the middle character is not equal to the first character, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed in one part, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop, and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed in one part.**
