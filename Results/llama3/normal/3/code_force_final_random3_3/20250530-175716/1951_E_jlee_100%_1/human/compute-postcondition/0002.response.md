Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^6, done is False**

Explanation:
The first line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable `string`. This reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1. The second line converts the string into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The third line calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The fourth line assigns the value `False` to the variable `done`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
