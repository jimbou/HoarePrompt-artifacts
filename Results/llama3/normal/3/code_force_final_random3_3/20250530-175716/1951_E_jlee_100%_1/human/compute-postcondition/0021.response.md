Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^6, done is False, x is the first character of the string s. The current value of `s` has a count of character `x` equal to `n`. We skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, and `x` remains the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input. The program skips to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
