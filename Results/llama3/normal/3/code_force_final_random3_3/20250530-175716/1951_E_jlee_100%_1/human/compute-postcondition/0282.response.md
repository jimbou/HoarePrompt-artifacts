The code prints the string in two parts: the first part from the beginning of the string to the character at index `j - 2` (since indexing starts at 0), and the second part from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Output: **the string in two parts: the first part from the beginning of the string to the character at index j - 2, and the second part from the character at index j - 1 to the end of the string**
