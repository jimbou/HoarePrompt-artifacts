Output: **'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False. `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `string`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 2 and `count2` is 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed**
