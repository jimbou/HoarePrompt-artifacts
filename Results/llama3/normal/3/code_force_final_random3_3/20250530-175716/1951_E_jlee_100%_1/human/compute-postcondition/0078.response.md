Output: *t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n must be greater than 0, if the character at position j in string s is not equal to the character at position n-1-j, then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False. If the character at position j in string s is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is equal to j. Otherwise, count remains unchanged. The current value of count is greater than 0. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x. count2 is greater than or equal to count. The current value of count2 is greater than count, and 'YES' is printed
