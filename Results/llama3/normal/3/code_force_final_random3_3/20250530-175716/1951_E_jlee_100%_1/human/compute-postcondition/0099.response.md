Output State: **count is greater than 0, count2 is less than count, done is True, j is 1, n is greater than 1, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `done = True` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `done` to `True`, which was initially `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is part of. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the output state.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `done` is now `True`, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
