Output: **'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False. `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than `count`, `x` is the first character of `string`, and `n` must be greater than 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0. The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`. The current value of `count2` is greater than `count`, and 'YES' is printed**
