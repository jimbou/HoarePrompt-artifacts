Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, the string has been printed in one or two parts, `done` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than 0, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j`. Otherwise, no additional action is taken. `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, and the loop has been terminated if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.***
