Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string in two parts. The first part will be from the beginning of the string to the current index `j`, and the second part will be from the current index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `j` is 0, the first part of the string will be empty, and the second part will be the entire string.

Output: **[empty string], [entire string]**
