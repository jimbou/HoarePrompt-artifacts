Output State: **count is 1, count2 is less than count, n is greater than 1, j is 1, done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed.**

The first line assigns the value of `j` to `count`, making `count` equal to 1. The second line is a `continue` statement, which does not affect any variables. The initial state's conditions that `count2` is less than `count`, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1 remain valid. Additionally, the conditions that `done` is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed also remain unchanged.
