Output: **'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, the string has been printed in one or two parts, `done` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is less than `count`, and `j` is 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. The loop has been terminated if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the string is printed in two parts: the first part is from the start of the string to the current position `j`, and the second part is from the current position `j` to the end of the string**
