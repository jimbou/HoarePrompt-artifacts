Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^6, done is False, x is the first character of the string s, and the current value of x is not equal to the last character of s, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables retain their original values, and the program continues to the next iteration.
