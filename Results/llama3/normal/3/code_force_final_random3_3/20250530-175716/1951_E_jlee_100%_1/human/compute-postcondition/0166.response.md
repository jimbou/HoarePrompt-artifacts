Postcondition: ***count is greater than 0, count2 is less than or equal to count, n is greater than 2, j is 2, and done is True. If count2 > count, then the number 2 is printed, and the string is printed in two parts: the first part from the start to the 2nd index, and the second part from the 2nd index to the end.
