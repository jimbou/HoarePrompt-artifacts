Postcondition: **The program's state after the if-else block execution is as follows: count is greater than 0, count2 is less than or equal to count, n is greater than 1, and j is 1. If count2 is less than count, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, and the string has been printed in two parts: the first part from the start to the character before the jth character, and the second part from the jth character to the end. If count is 1, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j] or count is 1, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. If s[j] equals x, then no changes have been made.**
