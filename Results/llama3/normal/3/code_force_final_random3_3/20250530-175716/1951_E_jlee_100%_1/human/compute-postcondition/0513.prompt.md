Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines of input, each line containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
            continue
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *'YES' has been printed, 1 or 2 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. If `done` is False, 'NO' is being printed, otherwise, no additional action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *'YES' has been printed, 1 or 2 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. If `done` is False, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `done` is True, `i` is equal to `t`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than or equal to `j`, `j` is equal to `n`, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, `count2` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is False. `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is `n - 1` and `count2` is `n - 1`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then the state remains unchanged. If `count2` is less than `count`, then the state remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is `n`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed. If `done` is True, then the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
