Postcondition: **If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then the program executes the if part. If `count2` is less than `count`, the number 2 is printed, and the string is printed in two parts: the first 2 characters and the rest of the string. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the string sliced from the beginning to the character before the second character and the string sliced from the second character to the end are printed, and `done` is True. If `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is 0, and `done` is True. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the number 2 is printed, and the string is printed in two parts: the first part from the start to the 2nd index, and the second part from the 2nd index to the end. Otherwise, no additional operations are performed. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then the program executes the else part. In this case, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and is at least 1 more than its previous value, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and string is printed, and `done` is set to True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is 2, `count2` is less than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `done` is True.**
