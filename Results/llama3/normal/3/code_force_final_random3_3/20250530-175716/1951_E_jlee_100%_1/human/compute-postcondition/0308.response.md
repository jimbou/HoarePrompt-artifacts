Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the string has been printed in one or two parts, `done` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed, and the string is printed, `done` is True. Otherwise, no additional actions are taken.***
