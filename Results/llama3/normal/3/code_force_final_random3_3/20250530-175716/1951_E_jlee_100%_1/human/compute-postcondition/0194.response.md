Output State: **'YES' has been printed, 'NO' has been printed, 1 or 2 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: We have printed 'YES' and 'NO', and either 1 or 2, and the string has been printed either in one part or two parts. The variable `done` is still False, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and `t` is still greater than the new value of `i`. The string is still the input from stdin, and `s` is still the list of characters in the string, and `n` is still the length of the string. We are moving on to the next iteration of the loop.
