Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, the string has been printed in one or two parts, `done` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1. If `count` is greater than 1, the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count2` is set to 0.***
