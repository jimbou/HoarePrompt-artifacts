Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, the string has been printed in one or two parts, `done` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the loop has been terminated and the string has been printed in two parts. Otherwise, the loop continues.***
