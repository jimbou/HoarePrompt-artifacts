Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines of input, each line containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains `t` lines of input, each line containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6. The values of the other variables are not affected.
