Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n must be greater than 0, if the character at position j in string s is not equal to the character at position n-1-j, then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False. If the character at position j in string s is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is equal to j. Otherwise, count remains unchanged. The current value of count is greater than 0. The character at position j in string s is equal to x. count2 is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count2 has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, and the input in stdin remains the same.
