Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed in one or two parts. `done` is False. `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `t` is greater than or equal to `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is `n - 1` and `count2` is `n - 1`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then the state remains unchanged. If `count2` is less than `count`, then the state remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is `n`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed. If `done` is True, then the state remains unchanged.***
