Postcondition: ***'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, the string has been printed in one or two parts, `done` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1. If the characters at the current positions `j` and `n-1-j` in the string are not equal and `count` is less than 1, `count` is equal to the new value of `j`. If `count2` is less than `count`, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and the string is printed in two parts: the first part from the start to the current position `j`, and the second part from the current position `j` to the end. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count2` is set to 0.***
