Output: ** `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^6, done is False, x is the first character of the string s. The current value of `s` has a count of character `x` equal to `n`. If the first character of the string s is not equal to the last character of s, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken, and 'NO' is printed**
