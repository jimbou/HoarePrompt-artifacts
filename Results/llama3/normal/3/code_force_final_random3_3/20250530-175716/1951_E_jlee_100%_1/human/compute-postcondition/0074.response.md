Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n must be greater than 0. If count is greater than 1, then 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first j-1 characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string starting from the jth character is printed, and done is True. If count is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, then done is False and count2 is 0.**
