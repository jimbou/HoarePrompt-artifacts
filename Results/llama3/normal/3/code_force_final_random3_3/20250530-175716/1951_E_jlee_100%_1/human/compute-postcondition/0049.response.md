Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n must be greater than 0, if the character at position j in string s is not equal to the character at position n-1-j, then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x and the current value of count is less than 1.**
