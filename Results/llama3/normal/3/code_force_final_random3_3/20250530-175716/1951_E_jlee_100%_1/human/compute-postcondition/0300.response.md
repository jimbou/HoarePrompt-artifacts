The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `j`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`. 
State: **'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the string has been printed in one or two parts, `done` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `string` is a string input from stdin, `s` is a list of characters in `string`, `n` is greater than the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1**
