Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^6, done is False, x is the first character of the string s, count is 0, count2 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *If count is greater than 0, then the program executes based on the value of count2 relative to count. If count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed along with the number 2, the first j characters of the string, and the rest of the string starting from the jth character, and done is set to True. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed along with the number 2, the first j-1 characters of the string, and the rest of the string starting from the jth character, and done is set to True. If count is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, then done is set to False and count2 is reset to 0. If count2 is greater than count, done is set to True. Otherwise, done remains unchanged. If the character at position j in string s is equal to x, count2 is increased by 1. If count is 0, the program does not execute any of the above operations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program's state after the if-else block execution is as follows: count is greater than 0, count2 is less than or equal to count, n is greater than 1, and j is 1. If count2 is less than count, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, and the string has been printed in two parts: the first part from the start to the character before the jth character, and the second part from the jth character to the end. If count is 1, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j] or count is 1, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. If s[j] equals s[n - 1 - j] and count is greater than 1, then no changes have been made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program executes based on the value of `count`. If `count` is greater than 0, the program checks the value of `s[j]` and `x`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, the program prints and updates variables based on the value of `count2` relative to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, the program updates `count2` and checks the value of `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the program prints and sets `done` to True. If `count` is less than 1, the program sets `count` to 2, `count2` to less than or equal to 2, and `done` to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
