Postcondition: **count is greater than 0, count2 is less than count, n is greater than 1, j is 1. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, and the string has been printed in two parts: the first part from the start to the character before the jth character, and the second part from the jth character to the end. If count is 1, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made. If count2 is not equal to count, then if count2 > count, then done is True. Otherwise, if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j] or count is 1, then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made.**
