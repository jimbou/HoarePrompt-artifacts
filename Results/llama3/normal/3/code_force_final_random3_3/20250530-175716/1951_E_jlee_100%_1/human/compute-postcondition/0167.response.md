Postcondition: ***count is greater than 0, count2 is less than or equal to count, n is greater than 2, and j is 2. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the string sliced from the beginning to the character before the second character and the string sliced from the second character to the end are printed, and done is True. If count is less than or equal to 1, count2 is 0, and done is True. If count2 is not equal to count, then if count2 is greater than count, the number 2 is printed, and the string is printed in two parts: the first part from the start to the 2nd index, and the second part from the 2nd index to the end. Otherwise, no additional operations are performed.***
