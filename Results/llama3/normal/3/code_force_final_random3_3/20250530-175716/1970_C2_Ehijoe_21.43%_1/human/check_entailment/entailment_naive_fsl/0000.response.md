Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes. The function `func_1` only considers the distances to the leaves of the tree, but it does not take into account the distances to the internal nodes.

For example, consider a tree with 5 nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The edges are (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), and (3, 5). If the starting node is 1, the program will only consider the distances to the leaves 2, 4, and 5, which are all 1. However, the program does not consider the distance to the internal node 3, which is also 1. As a result, the program will incorrectly determine the winner of the game.

To fix this issue, the program needs to calculate the distances to all nodes, not just the leaves. This can be done by modifying the `func_1` function to recursively calculate the distances to all nodes, not just the leaves.
