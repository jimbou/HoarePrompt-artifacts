Output: **nodes is a dictionary with n-1 key-value pairs, key is the last key in nodes, start is an integer, n is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n-2, stdin contains no input, u and v are integers, nodes[u] contains v and the new input integers, nodes[v] contains u and the new input integers, moves is a value returned by func_1(nodes, start), if the length of the value associated with the last key in nodes is 1, then leaves is a deque containing the last key in nodes, otherwise, leaves is an empty deque. All elements in moves are even, and 'Hermione' is being printed**
