To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1 (since the range is `n - 1`).

State: **nodes is an empty dictionary, start is a node in the tree, n is greater than 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 0**
