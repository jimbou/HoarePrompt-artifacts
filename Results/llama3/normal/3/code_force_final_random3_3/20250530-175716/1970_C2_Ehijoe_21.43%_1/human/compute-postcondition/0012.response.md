Postcondition: ***`nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `key` is the first key in `nodes`, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains no input, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` contains `v` and the new input integers, `nodes[v]` contains `u` and the new input integers. If the length of the value associated with the first key in `nodes` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the first key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `leaves` is an empty deque.***
