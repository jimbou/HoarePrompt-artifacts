Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with two keys: u and v, where u and v are integers, and each key maps to a list containing the other integer, start is a node in the tree, n is greater than 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 0, stdin contains no input**

Explanation:
The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to u and v. Since stdin is empty after this line, we don't include it in the output state. The second line appends v to the list of nodes[u] and the third line appends u to the list of nodes[v]. As a result, nodes becomes a dictionary with two keys: u and v, where each key maps to a list containing the other integer. The values of start, n, edges, empty, and i remain unchanged.
