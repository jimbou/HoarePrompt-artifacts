#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates distances from a specified node to all other nodes in a graph, excluding the parent node. It takes a graph represented as a list of lists of integers (nodes), a start node index, and a parent node index as input. If the start node has only one neighbor and it's the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single integer, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates distances from each neighbor of the start node to all other nodes, adds 1 to each distance, and returns a list of these distances.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a dictionary where the keys are nodes in a tree and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, start is a node in the tree.

If the current value of moves contains at least one odd number, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in moves are even, and 'Hermione' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a sequence of moves in a tree is won by 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. It takes a tree represented as a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, and a starting node, and returns a sequence of moves. The function then checks if any of the moves are odd, in which case it prints 'Ron', otherwise it prints 'Hermione'.
