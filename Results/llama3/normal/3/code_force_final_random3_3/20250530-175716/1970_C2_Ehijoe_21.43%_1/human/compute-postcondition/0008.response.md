Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with n-1 keys: u and v, where u and v are integers, and each key maps to a list containing the other integer and the new input integers, start is a node in the tree, n is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n-2, stdin contains no input, u and v are integers, nodes[u] contains v and the new input integers, nodes[v] contains u and the new input integers, leaves is an empty deque**

In this output state, a new variable `leaves` is introduced, which is an empty deque. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `leaves` deque is initialized but does not contain any elements yet.
