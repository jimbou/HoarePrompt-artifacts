This function calculates distances from a specified node to all other nodes in a graph, excluding the parent node. It takes a graph represented as a list of lists of integers (nodes), a start node index, and a parent node index as input. If the start node has only one neighbor and it's the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single integer, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates distances from each neighbor of the start node to all other nodes, adds 1 to each distance, and returns a list of these distances.
