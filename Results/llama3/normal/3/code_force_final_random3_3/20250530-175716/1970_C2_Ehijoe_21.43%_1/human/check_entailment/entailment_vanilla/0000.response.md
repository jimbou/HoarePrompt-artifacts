Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game played on a tree of n nodes. The game starts with a stone on a single node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor. The game ends when no valid move is available, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The provided program uses a recursive function `func_1` to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. The function returns a list of distances, where each distance is the minimum number of moves required to reach a node from the starting node.

The program then uses the `func_2` function to read the input, construct the tree, and find the starting node. It uses a deque to keep track of the leaves of the tree (nodes with only one neighbor) and calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes using `func_1`.

The program then checks if any of the distances are odd. If any distance is odd, it means that there is a node that can be reached in an odd number of moves, which means that Ron can win the game. Otherwise, Hermione can win the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
