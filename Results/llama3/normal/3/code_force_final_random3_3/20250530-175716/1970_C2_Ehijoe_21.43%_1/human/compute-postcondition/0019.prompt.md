Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: nodes is a dictionary with n-1 keys: u and v, where u and v are integers, and each key maps to a list containing the other integer and the new input integers, start is a node in the tree, n is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n-2, stdin contains no input, u and v are integers, nodes[u] contains v and the new input integers, nodes[v] contains u and the new input integers, leaves is an empty deque
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `key` is the first key in `nodes`, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains no input, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` contains `v` and the new input integers, `nodes[v]` contains `u` and the new input integers. If the length of the value associated with the first key in `nodes` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the first key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `leaves` is an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `key` is the second key in `nodes`, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains no input, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` contains `v` and the new input integers, `nodes[v]` contains `u` and the new input integers. If the length of the value associated with the second key in `nodes` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the second key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `leaves` is an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `key` is the third key in `nodes`, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains no input, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` contains `v` and the new input integers, `nodes[v]` contains `u` and the new input integers. If the length of the value associated with the third key in `nodes` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the third key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `leaves` is an empty deque.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
