To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **nodes is a dictionary with two keys: u and v, where u and v are integers, and each key maps to a list containing the other integer, start is a node in the tree, n is greater than 2, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is 1, stdin contains no input**
