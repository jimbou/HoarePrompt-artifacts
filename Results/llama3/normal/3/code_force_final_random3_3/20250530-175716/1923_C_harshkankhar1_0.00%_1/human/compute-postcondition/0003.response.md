The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 1 and 3 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the second element is 1 if c_1 > 1 else 2, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, q is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 2**
