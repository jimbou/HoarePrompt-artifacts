Output State: **a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is n, the elements of the list a have been printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed depending on the values of x and y.**

In this final state, the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is `n`. The elements of the list `a` have been printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed depending on the values of `x` and `y`. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, as one test case has been processed.
