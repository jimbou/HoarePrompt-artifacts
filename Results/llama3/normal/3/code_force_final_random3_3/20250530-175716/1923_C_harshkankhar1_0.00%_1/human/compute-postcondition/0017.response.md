Output State: **a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is 0, stdin contains t-q test cases, i is n, the elements of the list a have been printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed q times depending on the values of x and y.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the lists a and b remain unchanged, the value of q is reduced to 0, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by q, the value of i remains n, the elements of list a have been printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed q times depending on the values of x and y.
