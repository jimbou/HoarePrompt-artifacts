Output State: **a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified to contain the cumulative sums of the input integers, while the other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `a` is still 0, and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers. The list `b` still contains the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n. The values of `n`, `q`, and `i` are still the same, and the stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
