Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads an integer t, then for each test case, it reads two integers n and q, followed by n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, and then q lines each containing two integers l_i and r_i. It calculates the cumulative sums of the input integers and the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2, and prints the cumulative sums of the input integers. Then, for each query, it prints 'YES' if the cumulative sum of the input integers from l_i to r_i is greater than or equal to the cumulative sum of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 from l_i to r_i, and 'NO' otherwise.**
