Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n, and the elements of the list a are being printed
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is n, the elements of the list a have been printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed depending on the values of x and y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is n, the elements of the list a have been printed, 'NO' has been printed, x is an integer, y is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, i is n, the elements of the list a have been printed, 'NO' has been printed, x is an integer, y is an integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
