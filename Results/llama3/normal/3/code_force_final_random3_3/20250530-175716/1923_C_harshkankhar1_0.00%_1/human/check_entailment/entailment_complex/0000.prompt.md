Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, it contains two integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), followed by n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 10^9), and then q lines each containing two integers l_i and r_i (1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n).
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [0, cumulative sum of c_1, cumulative sum of c_1 + c_2, ..., cumulative sum of c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_n]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is 0, stdin contains t-q test cases, i is n, the elements of the list a have been printed, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed q times depending on the values of x and y.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads an integer t, then for each test case, it reads two integers n and q, followed by n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, and then q lines each containing two integers l_i and r_i. It calculates the cumulative sums of the input integers and the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2, and prints the cumulative sums of the input integers. Then, for each query, it prints 'YES' if the cumulative sum of the input integers from l_i to r_i is greater than or equal to the cumulative sum of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 from l_i to r_i, and 'NO' otherwise.
