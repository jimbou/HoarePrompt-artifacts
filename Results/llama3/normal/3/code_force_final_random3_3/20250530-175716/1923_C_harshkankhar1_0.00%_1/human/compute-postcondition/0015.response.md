The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1. So for the loop to execute again q must be greater than 0.
State: **a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n, the elements of the list a have been printed, 'NO' has been printed, x is an integer, y is an integer**
