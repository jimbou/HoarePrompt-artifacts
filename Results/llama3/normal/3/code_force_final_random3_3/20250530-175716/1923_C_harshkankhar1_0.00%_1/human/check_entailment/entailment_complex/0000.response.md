Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly calculates the cumulative sums of the input integers `a` and the cumulative sums of 1 if `c_i > 1` else 2, which is stored in `b`.

2. For each query, the program checks if the cumulative sum of the input integers from `l_i` to `r_i` is greater than or equal to the cumulative sum of 1 if `c_i > 1` else 2 from `l_i` to `r_i`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

3. The program also correctly handles the edge case where `x == y`, in which case it prints 'NO'.

4. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
