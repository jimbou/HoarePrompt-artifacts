Output State: **a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if c_1 > 1 else 2, the third element is the sum of the second element and 1 if c_2 > 1 else 2, and the fourth element is the sum of the third element and 1 if c_3 > 1 else 2, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, q is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 3, x is 1 if a[3] > 1 else 2**

The code snippet modifies the value of `x` and `b[i]`. The first line assigns the value of 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise 2, to `x`. Since `i` is 3, `x` becomes 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise 2. The second line assigns the sum of `b[i - 1]` and `x` to `b[i]`. Since `i` is 3, `b[3]` becomes the sum of `b[2]` and `x`. The value of `b[2]` is the sum of the second element and 1 if `c_2` is greater than 1, otherwise 2. Therefore, `b[3]` becomes the sum of the second element, 1 if `c_2` is greater than 1, otherwise 2, and 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise 2. No other variables are affected.
