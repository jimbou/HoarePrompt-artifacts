To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `q`. The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is irrelevant to the loop's execution.

State: **`a` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of 1 if c_i > 1 else 2 for i from 1 to n, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `q` must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n, and the elements of the list `a` are being printed**
