The code prints the elements of the list `a` which contains `n+1` integers. The first element of the list `a` is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`.

Since the exact values of the input integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the cumulative sums. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the list `a` containing `n+1` integers, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sums of the input integers.

Output: **[0, cumulative sum of c_1, cumulative sum of c_1 + c_2, ..., cumulative sum of c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_n]**
