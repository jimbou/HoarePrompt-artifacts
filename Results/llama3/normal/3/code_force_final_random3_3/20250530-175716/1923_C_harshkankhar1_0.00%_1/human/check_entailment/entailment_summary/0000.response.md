Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the input array `a` and the cumulative sum of `1` if `a[i] > 1` else `2`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of the subarray and the sum of the modified subarray (where each element is replaced by `1` if it's greater than `1` and `2` otherwise) in constant time.

2. For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray from `x` to `y` is greater than or equal to the sum of the modified subarray from `x` to `y`. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. The program also checks if `x` is equal to `y` and prints 'NO' in this case, because a single-element subarray cannot be good according to the given conditions.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions, and it does so efficiently by using cumulative sums.

Correctness: **True**
