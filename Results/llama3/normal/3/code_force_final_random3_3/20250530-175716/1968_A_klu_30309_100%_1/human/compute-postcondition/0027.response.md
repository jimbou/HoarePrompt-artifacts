Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, x is the second element in test_cases and must be at least 2, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is current_sum, best_y is y.**

The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum` and the value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `current_sum` is already `gcd_val + y` and `y` is `x - 2`, `max_sum` becomes `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` becomes `x - 2`. No other variables are affected.
