To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is a positive integer (no change needed)
* `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements (no change needed)
* `results` is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1 (no change needed)
* `x` is the third element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1 (no change needed)
* `y` is 0 (needs to be adjusted)
* `gcd_val` is 1 (no change needed)
* `current_sum` and `max_sum` are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them. However, we need to consider the condition that if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to 1 and `best_y` is updated to 0. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains unchanged and `best_y` remains 1.

To adjust the state for the next iteration:

* `y` needs to be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order. So, `y` becomes -1.

The updated state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, `x` is the third element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is -1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` and `max_sum` remain unchanged, and `best_y` remains 1**
