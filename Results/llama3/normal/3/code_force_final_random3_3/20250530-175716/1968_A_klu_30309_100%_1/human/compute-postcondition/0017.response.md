Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `results` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is `best_y`, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of `best_y` to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
