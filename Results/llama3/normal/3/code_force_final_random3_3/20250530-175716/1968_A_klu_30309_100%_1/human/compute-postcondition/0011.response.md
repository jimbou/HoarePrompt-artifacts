Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is set to y.***
