Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and 1, current_sum is gcd_val + 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The list `results` still has at least three elements, but its last element is now 1 (which is the new value of `best_y`), and the second last element is also 1. The value of `max_sum` is reset to 0, and `best_y` is set to 1.
