To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 1, because the range starts from `x - 1` and goes down to 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, `x` is the third element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1**
