To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than 0, and `y` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `x - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to decrease `y` by 1.

Since `y` is `x - 1`, decreasing `y` by 1 means that `y` becomes `x - 2`.

The other variables in the loop head are `x`, which is not changed in the loop body, and the range object, which is not a variable that can be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `y`, which becomes `x - 2`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `results` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y - 1`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
