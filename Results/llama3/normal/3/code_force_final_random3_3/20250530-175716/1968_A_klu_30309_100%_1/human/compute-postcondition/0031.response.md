Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, x is the second element in test_cases and must be at least 2, y is x - 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is current_sum, best_y is y**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. Since `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` becomes `gcd_val + y`. The second line assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state is not modified by the code, except for `max_sum` and `best_y`, which are updated to `current_sum` and `y`, respectively. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.
