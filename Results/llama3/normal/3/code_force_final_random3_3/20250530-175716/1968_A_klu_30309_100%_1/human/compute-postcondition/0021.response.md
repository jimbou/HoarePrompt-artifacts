Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, x is the second element in test_cases and must be at least 2, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is 0, and best_y is 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `gcd_val` and `current_sum`. The first line calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Since `x` is at least 2 and `y` is `x - 1`, the greatest common divisor is 1. The second line calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. Since `gcd_val` is 1 and `y` is `x - 1`, `current_sum` becomes `x`. No other variables are affected.
