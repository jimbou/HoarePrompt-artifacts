Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is a list with at least one element, x is the first element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is x - 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is current_sum, best_y is y**

The code snippet consists of three lines that assign values to variables. The first line assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. Since `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` becomes `gcd_val + y`. The second line assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `y` is `x - 3`, `best_y` becomes `x - 3`. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state remains valid, with `t` being a positive integer, `test_cases` being a list of integers with at least one element, `results` being a list with at least one element, `x` being the first element in `test_cases` and greater than 1, `y` being `x - 3`, `gcd_val` being the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` being `gcd_val + y`. The only changes are the assignments of `max_sum` and `best_y`, which are updated to `current_sum` and `y`, respectively.
