Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is 0, gcd_val is 1, max_sum is 2, best_y is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains a positive integer, test_cases remains a list of integers with at least 3 elements, results remains a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x remains the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is 0, gcd_val is 1, max_sum is 2, and best_y is 1.
