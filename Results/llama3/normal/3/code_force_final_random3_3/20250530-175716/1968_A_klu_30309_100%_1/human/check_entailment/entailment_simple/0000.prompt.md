Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    6
    18
    98

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer and test_cases is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and len(test_cases) == t.
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list of integers with length `t` where each element is the value of `best_y` for the corresponding element in `test_cases`, `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + `y`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers with length `t` where each element is the value of `best_y` for the corresponding element in `test_cases`. Each `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), where `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
