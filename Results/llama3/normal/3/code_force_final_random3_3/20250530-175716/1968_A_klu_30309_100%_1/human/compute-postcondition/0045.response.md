Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is 0, gcd_val is 1, if current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to 1 and best_y is updated to 0. Otherwise, max_sum remains unchanged and best_y remains 1.***
