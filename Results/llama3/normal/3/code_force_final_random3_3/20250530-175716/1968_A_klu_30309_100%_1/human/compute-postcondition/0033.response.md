Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, x is the second element in test_cases and must be at least 2, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and 1, current_sum is gcd_val + 1, max_sum is the maximum value of gcd_val + y for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1), best_y is the value of y that produces max_sum.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop iterates over the range from x - 1 to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order, updating the values of y, gcd_val, and current_sum at each iteration. The max_sum and best_y variables are updated only when the current_sum is greater than the max_sum. After the loop finishes, max_sum holds the maximum value of gcd_val + y for all y in the range, and best_y holds the value of y that produces this maximum sum.
