Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, x is the second element in test_cases and must be at least 2, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y and its current value is greater than max_sum, max_sum is gcd_val + y, and best_y is y - 1.**

The code snippet updates the values of `max_sum` and `best_y`. The first line assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`, effectively updating `max_sum` to be equal to `gcd_val + y`. The second line assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`, updating `best_y` to be equal to `y`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
