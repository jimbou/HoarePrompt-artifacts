Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is -1, gcd_val is 1, current_sum is 0, max_sum is 0, best_y is -1**

The code snippet assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`, making `max_sum` equal to 0. Then, it assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`, making `best_y` equal to -1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
