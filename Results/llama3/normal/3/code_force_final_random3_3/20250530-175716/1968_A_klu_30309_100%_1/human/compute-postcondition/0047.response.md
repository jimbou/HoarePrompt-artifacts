Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is -1, gcd_val is 1, current_sum is 0, max_sum remains unchanged, and best_y remains 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `gcd_val` and `current_sum`. The first line calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd()` function and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Since `x` is greater than 1 and `y` is -1, the GCD is 1. The second line calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. Since `gcd_val` is 1 and `y` is -1, `current_sum` becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
