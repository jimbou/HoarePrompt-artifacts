Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list of integers with length `t` where each element is the value of `best_y` for the corresponding element in `test_cases`, `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + `y`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer, `test_cases` becomes an empty list because all elements have been processed, and `results` becomes a list of integers with length `t` where each element is the value of `best_y` for the corresponding element in `test_cases`. The variables `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
