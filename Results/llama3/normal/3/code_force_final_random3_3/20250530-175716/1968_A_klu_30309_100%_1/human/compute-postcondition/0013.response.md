Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is a list with at least one element, x is the first element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is x - 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is set to y.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the initial state in any way. The first line calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. The second line calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. However, the code does not update `max_sum` or `best_y` because the condition `if current_sum is greater than max_sum` is not explicitly stated in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
