Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is 0, gcd_val is 1, current_sum is 1, max_sum is unchanged, best_y is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Since `y` is 0, the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, so `gcd_val` becomes 1. The second line calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. Since `gcd_val` is 1 and `y` is 0, `current_sum` becomes 1.

The initial state of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `y`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The only changes are to `gcd_val` and `current_sum`, which are updated based on the calculations performed in the code.
