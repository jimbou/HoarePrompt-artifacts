To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `x`, and the range defined by `x - 1` and `0` with a step of `-1`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is the second last element in the range from `x - 1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be the last element in the range, which is `0`.

However, since the range is defined with a step of `-1`, the last element in the range is actually the first element in the range when counting from `x - 1` down to `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `y` must be the first element in the range, which is `x - 1 - 1 = x - 2`.

Additionally, since `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and must be greater than `1`, for the loop to execute again, `x` must remain the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is `x - 2`**
