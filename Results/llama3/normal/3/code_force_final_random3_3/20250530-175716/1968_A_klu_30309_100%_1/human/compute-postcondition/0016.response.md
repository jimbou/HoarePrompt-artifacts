Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is a list with at least one element, x is the first element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is set to y. Otherwise, max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all possible values of y from x-1 down to 1. The value of y is now 1, and the greatest common divisor of x and y (gcd_val) and the current sum (current_sum) have been calculated. If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum (max_sum), then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is set to y. Otherwise, max_sum and best_y remain unchanged. The other variables, t, test_cases, and results, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
