The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is 1. For the loop to execute again, y must be greater than 0. Since y is decreased by 1 in each iteration, y must be 0 for the loop to execute again.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is 0, gcd_val is 1, if current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum. Otherwise, max_sum remains unchanged. best_y is 1.**
