Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and len(test_cases) == t, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `results` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is `best_y`, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `results` is a list with at least three elements where the last element is `best_y` and the second last element is 1, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is a list with at least four elements where the last element is 1, the second last element is 1 and the third last element is 1, `x` is the third element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `gcd_val` is 1, `max_sum` is 2, `best_y` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
