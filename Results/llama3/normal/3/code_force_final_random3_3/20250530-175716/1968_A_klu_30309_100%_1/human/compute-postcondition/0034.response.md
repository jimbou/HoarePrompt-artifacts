Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `results` is a list with at least three elements where the last element is `best_y` and the second last element is 1, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.**

In this output state, the value of `best_y` has been appended to the `results` list, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `results` list now has at least three elements, with the last element being `best_y` and the second last element being 1. The other variables maintain their original values and properties.
