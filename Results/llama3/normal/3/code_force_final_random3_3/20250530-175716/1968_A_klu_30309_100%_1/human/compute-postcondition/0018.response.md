To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for x in test_cases:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `x` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `test_cases`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, and `x` must be the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `results` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is `best_y`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum found so far, and `best_y` is the value of `y` that achieved `max_sum`**
