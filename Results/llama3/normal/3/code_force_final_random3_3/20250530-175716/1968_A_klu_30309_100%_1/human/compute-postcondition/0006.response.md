The code snippet consists of three lines: `max_sum = current_sum`, `best_y = y`, and `break`. 

The first line assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. Since `current_sum` is greater than the current value of `max_sum`, `max_sum` becomes equal to `current_sum`.

The second line assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `y` is `x - 1`, `best_y` becomes equal to `x - 1`.

The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

Considering the initial state and the combined effect of all lines, the final state is:

Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, max_sum is equal to the sum of gcd_val and y, best_y is x - 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y.**
