Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `y` is still `x - 1` as it is not modified by the code. The new variables `gcd_val` and `current_sum` are introduced, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`.
