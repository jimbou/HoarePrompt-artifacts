Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is 1, gcd_val is 1, current_sum is 2, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `y` also remains the same, which is 1. 

The value of `gcd_val` is updated to 1 because the greatest common divisor of `x` (which is greater than 1) and 1 is always 1. 

The value of `current_sum` is updated to 2 because it is now equal to `gcd_val` (which is 1) plus `y` (which is 1).
