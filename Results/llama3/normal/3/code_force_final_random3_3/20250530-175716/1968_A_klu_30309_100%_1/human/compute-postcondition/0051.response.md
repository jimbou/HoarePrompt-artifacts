Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is a list with at least four elements where the last element is 1, the second last element is 1 and the third last element is 1, `x` is the third element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `gcd_val` is 1, `max_sum` is 2, `best_y` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for the `results` list, which now has an additional element `best_y` (which is 1) appended to it. The length of the `results` list has increased by 1, and its last three elements are now 1, 1, and 1.
