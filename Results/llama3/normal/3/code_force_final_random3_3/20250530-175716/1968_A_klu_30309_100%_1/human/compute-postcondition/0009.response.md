Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y.**

The code calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Then, it calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
