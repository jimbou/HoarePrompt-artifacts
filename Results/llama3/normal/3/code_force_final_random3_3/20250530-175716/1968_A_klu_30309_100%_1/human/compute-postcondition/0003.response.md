To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 1, because the range starts from `x - 1` and goes down to 1 (since the step is -1). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be greater than 1. The state of `y` should be the starting value of the range, which is `x - 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`**
