The code initializes two new variables, `max_sum` and `best_y`, and assigns them the values 0 and 1, respectively. The existing variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `x` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1**
