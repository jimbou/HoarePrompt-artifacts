Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, x is the second element in test_cases and must be at least 2, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is either its original value or current_sum if current_sum is greater than max_sum, best_y is either its original value or y - 1 if current_sum is greater than max_sum.**

The code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. It then calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The values of `max_sum` and `best_y` are updated only if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.
