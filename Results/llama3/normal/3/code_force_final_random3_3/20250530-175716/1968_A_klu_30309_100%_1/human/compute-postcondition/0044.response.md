Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1 and the second last element is 1, x is the third element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, y is 0, gcd_val is 1, current_sum is 1, max_sum is 1, best_y is 0.**

The code block assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`, making `max_sum` equal to 1. It then assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`, making `best_y` equal to 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
