This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` as input, where each integer in `test_cases` is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. It calculates the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor and a number `y` for each integer `x` in `test_cases`, where `y` ranges from `x-1` to 1. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer is the value of `y` that produces the maximum sum for the corresponding integer in `test_cases
