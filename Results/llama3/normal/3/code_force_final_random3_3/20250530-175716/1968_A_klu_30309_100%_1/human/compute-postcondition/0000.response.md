The code creates an empty list called `results`. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged as the code does not affect these variables. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases and len(test_cases) == t, `results` is an empty list.**
