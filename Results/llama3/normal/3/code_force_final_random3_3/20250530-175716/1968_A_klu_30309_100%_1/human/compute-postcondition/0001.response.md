To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `test_cases` is not empty. Since `t` is a positive integer and `len(test_cases) == t`, we can conclude that `test_cases` must have at least one element.

At the start of the loop, `x` should be the first element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`**
