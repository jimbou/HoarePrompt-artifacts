The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 2`, which is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `results` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is either its original value or `current_sum` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is either its original value or `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`**
