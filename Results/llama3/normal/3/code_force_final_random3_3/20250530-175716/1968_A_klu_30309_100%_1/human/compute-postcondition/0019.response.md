Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, x is the second element in test_cases, y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and 1, current_sum is gcd_val + 1, max_sum is 0, and best_y is 1**

The code resets `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
