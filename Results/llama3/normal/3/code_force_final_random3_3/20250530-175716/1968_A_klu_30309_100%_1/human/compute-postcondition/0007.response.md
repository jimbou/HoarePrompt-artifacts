Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and must be greater than 1, if the sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y (x - 1) and y is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to this sum, best_y is updated to x - 1, otherwise max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.***
