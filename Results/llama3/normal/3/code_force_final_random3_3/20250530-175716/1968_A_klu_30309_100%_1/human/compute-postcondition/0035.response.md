To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for x in test_cases:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `x` and `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` must be the third element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is a list with at least three elements where the last element is `best_y` and the second last element is 1, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.**
