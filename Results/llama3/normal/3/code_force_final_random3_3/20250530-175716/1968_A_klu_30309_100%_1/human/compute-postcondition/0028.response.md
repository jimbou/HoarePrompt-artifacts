Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 1, x is the second element in test_cases and must be at least 2, y is x - 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, max_sum is either its original value or current_sum if current_sum is greater than max_sum, best_y is either its original value or y if current_sum is greater than max_sum***
