Output State: **The program returns a list of integers with length `t` where each element is the value of `best_y` for the corresponding element in `test_cases`. Each `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), where `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**
