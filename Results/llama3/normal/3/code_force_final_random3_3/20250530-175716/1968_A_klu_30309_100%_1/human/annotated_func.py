    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list of integers with length `t` where each element is the value of `best_y` for the corresponding element in `test_cases`, `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val` + `y`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers with length `t` where each element is the value of `best_y` for the corresponding element in `test_cases`. Each `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces the maximum value of `gcd_val` + `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), where `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and must be greater than 1, and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` as input, where each integer in `test_cases` is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. It calculates the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor and a number `y` for each integer `x` in `test_cases`, where `y` ranges from `x-1` to 1. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer is the value of `y` that produces the maximum sum for the corresponding integer in `test_cases
