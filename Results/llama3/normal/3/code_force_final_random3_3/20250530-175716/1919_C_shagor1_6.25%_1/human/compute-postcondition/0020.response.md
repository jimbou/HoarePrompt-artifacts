Output State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`, `y` is the third integer in the list, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 input, and `a` is the third integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the third integer in the list, which is also the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `x` still being either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`, `ans` being either 0 or 1, and `_` being 0. The input in `stdin` has also been reduced by one.
