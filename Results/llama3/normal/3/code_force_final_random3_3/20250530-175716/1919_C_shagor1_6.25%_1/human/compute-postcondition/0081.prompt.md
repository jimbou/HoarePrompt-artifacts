Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, inp is an empty list, x is the smallest integer in the original list, y is the second smallest integer in the original list, ans is the number of integers in the original list minus 2, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input, and the number of integers in the original list minus 2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is an empty list, `x` is the smallest element in the original `inp` list, `y` is the second smallest element in the original `inp` list, `ans` is the number of elements in the original `inp` list minus 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the last element in the original `inp` list, and the number of elements in the original `inp` list minus 2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is an empty list, `x` is the smallest integer in the list that is less than or equal to `n` + 1, `y` is the second smallest integer in the list that is less than or equal to `n` + 1, `ans` is the number of integers in the list that are greater than the second smallest integer in the list that is less than or equal to `n` + 1, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `a` is undefined, and the number of integers in the list that are greater than the second smallest integer in the list that is less than or equal to `n` + 1 which is `ans` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
