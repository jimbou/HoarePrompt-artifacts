To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `a` and the list `inp`. The loop will execute if `inp` has at least one element. Since `a` will take the value of the first element in `inp` at the start of the loop, we can adjust the state of `a` to be the first element in `inp`.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n` + 1, `y` is `n` + 1, `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the first element in `inp`**
