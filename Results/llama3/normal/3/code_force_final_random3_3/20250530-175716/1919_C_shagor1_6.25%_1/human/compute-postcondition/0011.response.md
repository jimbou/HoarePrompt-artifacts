Postcondition: ***n is an integer, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is either the first integer in the list or n + 1, y is either the first integer in the list or n + 1, ans is either 0 or 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input, and a is the first integer in the list. If a is less than or equal to n + 1, then x is set to the first integer in the list. If a is larger than n + 1, then either y is set to the first integer in the list if a is less than or equal to y, or ans is set to 1 if a is larger than y.***
