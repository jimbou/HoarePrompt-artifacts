Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list if it is less than or equal to `n` + 1, otherwise `x` is `n` + 1, `y` is `n` + 1 if the first integer in the list is larger than `n` + 1, otherwise `y` is the first integer in the list if it is less than or equal to `n` + 1, otherwise `y` is set to the first integer in the list if it is larger than `n` + 1 and less than or equal to `n` + 1, otherwise `ans` is set to 1 and `y` is set to the first integer in the list, `ans` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the first integer in the list.***
