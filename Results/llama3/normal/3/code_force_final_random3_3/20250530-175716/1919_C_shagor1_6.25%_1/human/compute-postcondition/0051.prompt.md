Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value, inp is a list of integers, x is n + 1, y is n + 1, ans is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is either the first element in `inp` or `n` + 1, `y` is either the first element in `inp` or `n` + 1, `ans` is 0 if the first element in `inp` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the first element in `inp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is either the second element in `inp` or `n` + 1, `y` is either the second element in `inp` or `n` + 1, `ans` is 0 if the second element in `inp` is less than or equal to `y`, 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y` and `a` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the second element in `inp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is either the second element in `inp` or `n` + 1, `y` is either the second element in `inp` or `n` + 1, `ans` is 0 if the second element in `inp` is less than or equal to `y`, 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y` and `a` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `a` is less than or equal to `y` and `a` is greater than the third element in `inp`, otherwise 3, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the third element in `inp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
