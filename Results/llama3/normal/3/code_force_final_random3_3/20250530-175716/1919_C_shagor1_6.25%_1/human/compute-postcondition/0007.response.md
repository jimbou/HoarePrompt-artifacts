Output State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is the first integer in the list, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input, the first integer in the list is larger than `n + 1` and the current value of the first integer in the list is less than or equal to `n + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the first integer in the list, which is larger than `n + 1` and less than or equal to `n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less input.
