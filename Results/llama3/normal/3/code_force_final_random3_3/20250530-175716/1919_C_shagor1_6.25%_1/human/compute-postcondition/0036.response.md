The first line checks if `x` is equal to `y`, which is true since both are equal to `n + 1`. The second line assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is larger than `x` and `y`, `y` becomes larger than its original value. The third line increments `ans` by 1, making it equal to 1.

Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is n + 1, y is a (which is larger than x and the first element in inp), ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty, a is the first element in inp.**
