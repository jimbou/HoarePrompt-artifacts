Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 input, and `_` is 0. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is the third integer in the list and `y` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`. Otherwise, `y` is the third integer in the list and `x` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`. In the latter case, if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is either 0 or 1, otherwise `ans` is either 1 or 2.***
