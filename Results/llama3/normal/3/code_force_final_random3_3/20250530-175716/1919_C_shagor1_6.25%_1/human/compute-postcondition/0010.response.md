Postcondition: ***n is an integer, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is n + 1, y is either the first integer in the list or n + 1, ans is either 0 or 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input, a is the first integer in the list, and a is larger than x. If a is less than or equal to y, then y is set to the first integer in the list. Otherwise, ans is set to 1.***
