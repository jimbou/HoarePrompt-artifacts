Based on the precondition, the variable `ans` is defined as the number of integers in the original list minus 2. Since the original list is not explicitly provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **the number of integers in the original list minus 2**
