Output State: **n is an integer, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is n + 1, y is a, ans is 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input, a is the first integer in the list, a is larger than x, and a is larger than y**

The first line checks if `x` is equal to `y`, but since `x` is `n + 1` and `y` is also `n + 1`, this condition is true. The second line assigns the value of `a` to `y`, making `y` equal to the first integer in the list. The third line increments `ans` by 1, making `ans` equal to 1. No other variables are affected.
