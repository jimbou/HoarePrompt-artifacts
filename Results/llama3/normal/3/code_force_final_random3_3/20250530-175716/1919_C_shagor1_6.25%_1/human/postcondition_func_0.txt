This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then finds the smallest and second smallest integers in the list that are less than or equal to n + 1, and counts the number of integers in the list that are greater than the second smallest integer. The function prints the count for each test case, effectively processing and analyzing the input data.
