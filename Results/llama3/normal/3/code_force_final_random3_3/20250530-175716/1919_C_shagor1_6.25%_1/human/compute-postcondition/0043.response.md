Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is either the second element in `inp` or `n` + 1, `y` is the second element in `inp`, `ans` is 0 if the second element in `inp` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the second element in `inp`.***
