Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`, `y` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 input, and `a` is the second integer in the list. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is the second integer in the list. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `y` is the second integer in the list if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is set to 1.***
