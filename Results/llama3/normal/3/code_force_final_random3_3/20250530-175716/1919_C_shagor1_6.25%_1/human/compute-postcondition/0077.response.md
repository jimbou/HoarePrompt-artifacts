Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list if it is less than or equal to `n` + 1, otherwise `x` is `n` + 1, `y` is `n` + 1 if the third integer in the list is larger than `n` + 1, otherwise `y` is the third integer in the list if it is less than or equal to `n` + 1, `a` is the third integer in the list, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `ans` is 1.***
