Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list if it is less than or equal to `n` + 1, otherwise `x` is `n` + 1, `y` is the third integer in the list, `a` is the third integer in the list, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` has been updated to be the same as `a`, which is the third integer in the list `inp`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` are still dependent on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`, but now `y` is equal to `a`.
