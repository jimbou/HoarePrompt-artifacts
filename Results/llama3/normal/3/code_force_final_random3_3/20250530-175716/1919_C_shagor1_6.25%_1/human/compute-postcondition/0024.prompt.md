Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, inp is a list of integers, x is n + 1, y is n + 1, ans is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is either the first integer in the list or n + 1, y is either the first integer in the list or n + 1, ans is either 0 or 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input, and a is the first integer in the list. If a is less than or equal to n + 1, then x is set to the first integer in the list. If a is larger than n + 1, then either y is set to the first integer in the list if a is less than or equal to y, or ans is set to 1 if a is larger than y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`, `y` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 input, and `a` is the second integer in the list. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is the second integer in the list. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `y` is the second integer in the list if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1 input, and `_` is 0. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is the third integer in the list and `y` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`. Otherwise, `y` is the third integer in the list and `x` is either the first integer in the list or `n + 1`. In the latter case, if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is either 0 or 1, otherwise `ans` is either 1 or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
