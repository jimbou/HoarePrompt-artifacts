The input contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5) — the size of the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) — the elements of the array a.
