Postcondition: ***vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with one or two elements removed, v1 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive), v2 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (3 <= n <= 10^5). If v2 > 0, then ops contains a tuple of two integers (v1, v2). If v2 is 0, then ops contains two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and vx has two elements removed.***
