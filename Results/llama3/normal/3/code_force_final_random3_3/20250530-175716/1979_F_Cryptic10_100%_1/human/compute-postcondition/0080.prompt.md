Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, `p2` is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 0., and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list `p1` and list `p2`, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *vx is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for v1 and possibly v3, ops is a list containing either a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, p1 is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, p2 is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *vx is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for v1, v3, and the removed element, ops is a list containing either a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, and also contains the tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, or two additional tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, p1 is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, p2 is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed, and the input integer is at least 4.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: vx is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for v1, v3, the removed element, and either the element removed in this code snippet if v2 > 0, or the newly removed element if v2 <= 0. ops is a list containing either a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, and also contains either the tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, or two additional tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0. p1 is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, p2 is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed, and the input integer is at least 5, v1 is an integer from 1 to the input integer except for v3 and the removed element, and v2 is an integer.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
