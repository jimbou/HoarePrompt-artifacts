Output State: **vx is a set containing two integers, ops is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, and stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the set vx will be left with only two integers, and the list ops will contain a series of tuples, each representing an operation performed during the loop's execution. The stdin will still contain at least one input integer, which is the initial value of n.
