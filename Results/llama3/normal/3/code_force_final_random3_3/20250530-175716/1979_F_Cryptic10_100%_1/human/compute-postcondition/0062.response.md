Output State: **`vx` is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, `p2` is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 0., and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list `p1` and list `p2`, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces.**

In this output state, the value of `vx` has changed to a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer, while the values of `p1` and `p2` are still lists containing at most two integers and at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, respectively. The value of `ops` remains an empty list. The stdin still contains at least -1 input: an integer. The value of _ is still 0. The print statement still prints "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list `p1` and list `p2`, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces.
