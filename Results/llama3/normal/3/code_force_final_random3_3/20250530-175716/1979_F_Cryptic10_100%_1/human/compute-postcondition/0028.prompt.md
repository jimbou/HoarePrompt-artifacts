Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is an empty list, and stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5).
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer, `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in the list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer, `v1` and `v2` are the second-to-last tuple in the list, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5), `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer and one more integer if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, else `p1` is a list containing three integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer and an additional integer `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the last tuple in the list, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
