The only objects in the loop head are variables  ops, v1 and v2, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ops.  If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second last tuple. At the end of the last iteration, ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that is not empty, (v1, v2) is the last element of ops. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 tuples and (v1, v2) is the second last element of ops.
State: **`vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that has at least 2 tuples, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most one integer from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1, (v1, v2) is the second last element of ops, if p1[-1] == v2 then p2 contains v1 else p1 contains v1**
