Postcondition: ***vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with three or four elements removed and must have more than 1 elements, v1 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and is removed from vx, v2 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2), stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5). If v2 > 0, then ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2). Otherwise, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) and two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0).***
