Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is an empty list, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer, and `_` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *vx is a set containing integers from 1 to n, excluding v1 and possibly v3, where n is an integer greater than 2, ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing two integers, p2 is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and _ is 1. If v2 > 0, then ops contains a tuple (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, then ops contains two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and vx excludes v3.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *vx is a set containing integers from 1 to n, excluding v1, v2, and possibly v3, where n is an integer greater than 3, ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing two integers, p2 is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and _ is 1. If v2 > 0, then ops also contains the tuple (v1, v2). Otherwise, v3 is an integer.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *vx is a set containing integers from 1 to n, excluding v1, v2, v3, and possibly other elements, where n is an integer greater than 3. If v2 > 0, vx has at least 2 elements and ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) and an additional tuple (v1, v2). Otherwise, vx has at least 1 element, ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and v3 is an integer. In both cases, p1 is a list containing two integers, p2 is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and _ is 1, v1 and v2 are integers.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
