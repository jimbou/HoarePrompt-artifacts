Output State: **`vx` is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for `v1`, `ops` is a list containing a tuple of (`v1`, `v2`), `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, `p2` is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list `p1` and list `p2`, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces. The current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` remains unchanged, containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for `v1`. The list `ops` now contains a tuple of (`v1`, `v2`). The lists `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one input: an integer. The value of `_` is still 0. The same string is still printed. The value of `v2` is still greater than 0.
