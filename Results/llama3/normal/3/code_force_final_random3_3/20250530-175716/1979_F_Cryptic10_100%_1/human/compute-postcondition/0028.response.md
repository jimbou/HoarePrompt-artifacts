Output State: **vx is a set containing two integers, ops is an empty list, p1 is a list containing two integers, p2 is a list containing all the integers from the tuples in ops, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the set `vx` remains unchanged, the list `ops` is empty because all its tuples have been processed, the list `p1` remains unchanged, and the list `p2` contains all the integers from the tuples in `ops`. The input from `stdin` remains the same, with at least one input integer `n` within the range 2 to 10^5.
