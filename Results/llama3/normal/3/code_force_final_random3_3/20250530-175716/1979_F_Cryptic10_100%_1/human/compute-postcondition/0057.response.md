Output State: **`vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that has at least 1 tuples, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1, (v1, v2) is the last element of ops, if p1[-1] == v2 then p2 contains v1, v2 and p1 contains v1 and p1[-1] else p1 contains v1, v1 and p1[-1] and p2 contains p1[-1]**.

In this output state, the values of `vx`, `ops`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If the condition is true, `p2` now contains `v1` and `v2`, and `p1` remains the same. If the condition is false, `p1` now contains `v1` and `p1[-1]`, and `p2` contains `p1[-1]`. The stdin still contains at least -1 input: an integer.
