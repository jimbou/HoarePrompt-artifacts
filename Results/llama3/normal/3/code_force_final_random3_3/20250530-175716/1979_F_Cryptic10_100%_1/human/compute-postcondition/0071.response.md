Output State: **vx is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for v1, v3, and the removed element, ops is a list containing either a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, p1 is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, p2 is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed, and the input integer is at least 4**
