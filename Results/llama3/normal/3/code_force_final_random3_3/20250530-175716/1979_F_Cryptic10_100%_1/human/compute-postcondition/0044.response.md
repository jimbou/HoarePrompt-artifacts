Postcondition: ***vx is a set containing integers from 1 to n, excluding v1, v2, and possibly v3, where n is an integer greater than 3, ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing two integers, p2 is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and _ is 1. If v2 > 0, then ops also contains the tuple (v1, v2). Otherwise, v3 is an integer.***
