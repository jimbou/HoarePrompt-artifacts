Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input, prints '? %d' % d, and returns a list of integers from the input, stdin contains t-1 inputs: integers (2 <= n <= 10^5)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: vx is a set containing two integers, ops is an empty list, p1 is a list containing two integers, p2 is a list containing all the integers from the tuples in ops, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5), and this is printed: '! ' followed by the elements of p1 in reverse order and the elements of p2, all separated by spaces

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most n integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1., and this is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list `p1` and list `p2`, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same, `p2` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same and if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2` then `p2` has increased by one element which is `v1` otherwise `p1` has increased by one element which is `v1`, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, `v1` is undefined, `v2` is undefined, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
