Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and `_` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that is not empty, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most one integer from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1, (v1, v2) is the last element of ops, if p1[-1] == v2 then p2 contains v1 else p1 contains v1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that has at least 2 tuples, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most one integer from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1, (v1, v2) is the second last element of ops, if p1[-1] == v2 then p2 contains v1 and v2 else p1 contains v1 and p1[-1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that has at least 1 tuples, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1, (v1, v2) is the last element of ops, if p1[-1] == v2 then p2 contains v1, v2 and p1 contains v1 and p1[-1] else p1 contains v1, v1 and p1[-1] and p2 contains p1[-1]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
