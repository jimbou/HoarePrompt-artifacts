Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input, prints '? %d' % d, and returns a list of integers from the input, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list, stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the function `q` remains unchanged. The variable `vx` is assigned a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive), where n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) that was read from the input. The variable `ops` is assigned an empty list. The stdin now contains at least 0 input: an integer, since one integer has been read and used to create the set `vx`.
