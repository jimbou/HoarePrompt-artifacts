Postcondition: **vx is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for v1, v3, the removed element, and either the element removed in this code snippet if v2 > 0, or the newly removed element if v2 <= 0. ops is a list containing either a tuple of (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0, and also contains either the tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, or two additional tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 <= 0. p1 is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, p2 is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed, and the input integer is at least 5, v1 is an integer from 1 to the input integer except for v3 and the removed element, and v2 is an integer.**
