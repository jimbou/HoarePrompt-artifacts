Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with four or five elements removed and must have more than 1 elements, `v1` is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and is removed from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, `ops` is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2), and now `ops` has an additional tuple (v1, v2), stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5).**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` still contains integers from 1 to n with four or five elements removed and has more than one element. The integer `v1` is still removed from `vx` and is within the range 1 to n. The integer `v2` is still either within the range 1 to n or is 0. The list `ops` now has an additional tuple containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. The input in stdin remains unchanged, containing at least one integer within the range 4 to 10^5.
