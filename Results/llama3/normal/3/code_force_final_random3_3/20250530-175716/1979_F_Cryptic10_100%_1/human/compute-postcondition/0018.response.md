Output State: **vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with five or six elements removed and must have more than 0 elements, v1 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and is removed from vx, v2 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) and two additional tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5).**

In this output state, vx has one more element removed than in the initial state, which is v3. The ops list has two additional tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). Stdin now contains one less input than in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
