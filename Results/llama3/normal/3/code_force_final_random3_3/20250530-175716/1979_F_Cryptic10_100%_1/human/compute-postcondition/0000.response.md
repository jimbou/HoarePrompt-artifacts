Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input, prints '? %d' % d, and returns a list of integers from the input, stdin contains t-1 inputs: integers (2 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the function `q` is defined to take an integer `d` as input, print '? %d' % d, and then return a list of integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The stdin still contains t-1 inputs: integers (2 <= n <= 10^5), as only one input has been consumed by the `input()` function inside the `q` function.
