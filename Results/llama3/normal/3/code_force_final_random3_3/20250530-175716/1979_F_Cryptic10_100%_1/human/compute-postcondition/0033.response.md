To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `len(vx) > 2`. Since `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), we need to adjust the state of `n` to guarantee that the length of `vx` is indeed greater than 2.

Given that `n` is already between 2 and 10^5, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `vx` contains at least 3 elements (1, 2, and at least one more). Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than 2, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is an empty list, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer, and `_` is 1**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `n` to ensure that the length of `vx` is greater than 2, as required by the loop condition.
