Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, excluding `v1`, where `n` is an integer greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing a tuple (`v1`, `v2`), `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and `_` is 1. The current value of `v2` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the list `ops` has been updated to include a tuple containing the values of `v1` and `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one input, which is an integer. The value of `_` remains 1, and the value of `v2` is still greater than 0.
