Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with one element removed, `v1` is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive), `v2` is a positive integer from 1 to n (inclusive), `ops` is a list containing a tuple of two integers (`v1`, `v2`), stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the values of `vx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The `ops` list, which was initially empty, now contains a tuple of two integers (`v1`, `v2`). The stdin still contains at least 0 input: an integer, with the same range as before (3 <= n <= 10^5).
