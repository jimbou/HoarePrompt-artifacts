Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that must have at least two elements, `p1` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same, `p2` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same and if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2` then `p2` has increased by one element which is `v1` otherwise `p1` has increased by one element which is `v1`, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in ops, `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in ops.**

In this output state, the values of `vx`, `ops`, `stdin`, `_`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. However, either `p1` or `p2` has been modified. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `p2` has been appended with `v1`, otherwise `p1` has been appended with `v1`.
