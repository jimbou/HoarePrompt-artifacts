Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `p1` is an empty list, `p2` is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `vx`, `ops`, and `_` remain unchanged. The list `p1` is now empty, and the list `p2` is also empty. The stdin still contains at least -1 input: an integer. The output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed.
