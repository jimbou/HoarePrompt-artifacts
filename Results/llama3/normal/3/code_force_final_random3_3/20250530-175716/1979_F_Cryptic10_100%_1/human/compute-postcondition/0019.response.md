Postcondition: ***vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with four, five or six elements removed and must have more than 0 elements, v1 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and is removed from vx, v2 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2), and now ops has an additional tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise ops has two additional tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5).***
