Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `p1` is an empty list, `p2` is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that must not be empty, `p1` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same, `p2` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed, `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in ops, `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in ops, and either `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` or it is not.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that must have at least two elements, `p1` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same, `p2` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same and if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2` then `p2` has increased by one element which is `v1` otherwise `p1` has increased by one element which is `v1`, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in ops, `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in ops.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that must have at least 3 elements, `p1` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same, `p2` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same and if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2` then `p2` has increased by one element which is `v1` otherwise `p1` has increased by one element which is `v1`, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, `v1` is the first element of the third-to-last tuple in ops, `v2` is the second element of the third-to-last tuple in ops




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
