To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ops` and the variables `v1` and `v2`. The loop will execute if `ops` is not empty.

State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that must not be empty, `p1` is an empty list, `p2` is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed, `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in ops, `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in ops**
