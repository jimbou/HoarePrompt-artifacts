Output State: **`vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most n integers from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have an empty list `ops`, and the list `p2` will contain at most n integers from 1 to n. The other variables, `vx`, `p1`, stdin, and `_`, will remain unchanged.
