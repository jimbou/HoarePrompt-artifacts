Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that must not be empty, `p1` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same, `p2` is a list that has either increased by one element or remains the same, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list p1 and list p2, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed, `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in ops, `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in ops, and either `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` or it is not.**

In this output state, either `p1` or `p2` has been appended with `v1`, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` or not. The other variables remain unchanged. The output is printed as specified, and the stdin still contains at least -1 input: an integer.
