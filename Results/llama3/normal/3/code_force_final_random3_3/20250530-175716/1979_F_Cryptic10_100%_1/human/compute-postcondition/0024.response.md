To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the `ops` list in reverse order.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple. Since we are iterating in reverse order, the first tuple in the list is `v1` and `v2`.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `ops` and the variables `v1` and `v2`.

Since we are iterating in reverse order, the next tuple to be processed would be the second-to-last tuple in the list. Therefore, `ops` must have at least 2 tuples.

The state of `v1` and `v2` would be the second-to-last tuple in the list.

The other variables `vx`, `p1`, `p2`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer, `v1` and `v2` are the second-to-last tuple in the list, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)**
