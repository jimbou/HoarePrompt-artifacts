Output State: **`vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that has at least 2 tuples, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most one integer from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1, (v1, v2) is the second last element of ops, if p1[-1] == v2 then p2 contains v1 and v2 else p1 contains v1 and p1[-1].**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` still contains at most two integers from 1 to n. The list `ops` still contains tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) and has at least 2 tuples. The list `p1` still contains at most two integers from 1 to n. The list `p2` still contains at most one integer from 1 to n. The stdin still contains at least -1 input: an integer. The variable `_` is still 1. The tuple (v1, v2) is still the second last element of ops. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `p2` now contains `v1` and `v2`, otherwise `p1` now contains `v1` and its last element.
