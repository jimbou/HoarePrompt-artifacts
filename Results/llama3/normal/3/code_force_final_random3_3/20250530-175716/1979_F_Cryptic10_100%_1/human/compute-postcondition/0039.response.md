Postcondition: ***vx is a set containing integers from 1 to n, excluding v1 and possibly v3, where n is an integer greater than 2, ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing two integers, p2 is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and _ is 1. If v2 > 0, then ops contains a tuple (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, then ops contains two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and vx excludes v3.***
