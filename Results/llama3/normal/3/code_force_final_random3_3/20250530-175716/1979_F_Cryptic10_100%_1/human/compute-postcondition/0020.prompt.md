Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input, prints '? %d' % d, and returns a list of integers from the input, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list, stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with one or two elements removed, v1 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive), v2 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (3 <= n <= 10^5). If v2 > 0, then ops contains a tuple of two integers (v1, v2). If v2 is 0, then ops contains two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and vx has two elements removed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with three or four elements removed and must have more than 1 elements, v1 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and is removed from vx, v2 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2), stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5). If v2 > 0, then ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2). Otherwise, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) and two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with four, five or six elements removed and must have more than 0 elements, v1 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and is removed from vx, v2 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2), and now ops has an additional tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise ops has two additional tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
