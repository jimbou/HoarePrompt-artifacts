The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stdin`. If `stdin` has at least 1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` has at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5). So for the loop to be executed one more time the `stdin` must have at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5) and `_` is 1.
State: **`vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing all the integers from the tuples in `ops`, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5), `_` is 1**
