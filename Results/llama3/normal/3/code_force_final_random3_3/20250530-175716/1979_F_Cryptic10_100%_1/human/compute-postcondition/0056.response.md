State: **`vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that has at least 1 tuples, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is a list containing at most one integer from 1 to n, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1, (v1, v2) is the last element of ops, if p1[-1] == v2 then p2 contains v1 and v2 else p1 contains v1 and p1[-1]**
