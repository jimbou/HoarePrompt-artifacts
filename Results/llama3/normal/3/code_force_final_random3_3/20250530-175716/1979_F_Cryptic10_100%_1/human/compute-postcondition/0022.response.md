The only objects in the loop head are variables  `v1`, `v2` and list `ops`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops`.  If the list has at least 1 tuple the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is an empty list, and stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5). So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 tuple and the `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in the list.
State: **`vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5), `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in the list**
