Output State: **`vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and `_` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `vx`, `ops`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `p1` is updated to be a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, which are the elements of the set `vx`. The value of `p2` is updated to be an empty list. The stdin still contains at least -1 input: an integer.
