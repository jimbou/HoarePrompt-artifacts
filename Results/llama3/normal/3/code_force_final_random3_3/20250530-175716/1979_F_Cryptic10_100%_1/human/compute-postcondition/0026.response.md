To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the `ops` list in reverse order.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` are the second-to-last tuple in the list. For the loop to execute again, we need to move to the previous tuple in the reversed list.

Since `ops` is a list of tuples, we can adjust the state of `ops` by removing the last tuple (which was processed in the previous iteration). This will make the next tuple (the one before the previous `v1` and `v2`) the new `v1` and `v2`.

The other variables (`vx`, `p1`, `p2`, and `stdin`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer, `v1` and `v2` are the last tuple in the list, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)**
