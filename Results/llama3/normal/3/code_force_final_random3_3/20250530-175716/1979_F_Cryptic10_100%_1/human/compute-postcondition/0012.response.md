Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with three or four elements removed and must have more than 1 elements, `v1` is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and is removed from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, `ops` is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2), stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The set `vx` still has three or four elements removed and has more than one element. The integer `v1` is still removed from `vx`. The integer `v2` is still either an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0. The stdin still contains at least 0 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5).
