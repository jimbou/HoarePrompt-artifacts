Output State: **`vx` is a set containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for `v1`, `v3`, and the removed element, `ops` is a list containing either a tuple of (`v1`, `v2`) if `v2` > 0, or two tuples: (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0) if `v2` <= 0, and also contains the tuple (`v1`, `v2`), `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to the input integer, `p2` is a list containing at most the input integer integers from 1 to the input integer, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, `_` is 0, and the output "! " followed by the concatenation of the reversed list `p1` and list `p2`, with all elements converted to strings and separated by spaces, is printed, and the input integer is at least 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: The set `vx` remains unchanged, containing all integers from 1 to the input integer except for `v1`, `v3`, and the removed element. The list `ops` now contains an additional tuple (`v1`, `v2`) in addition to its previous contents. The lists `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least -1 input: an integer. The variable `_` remains 0. The output is still printed as before. The input integer is still at least 4.
