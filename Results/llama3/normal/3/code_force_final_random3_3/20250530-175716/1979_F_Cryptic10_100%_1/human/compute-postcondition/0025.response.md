Output State: **`vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer, `v1` and `v2` are the second-to-last tuple in the list, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5), `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer and one more integer if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, else `p1` is a list containing three integers.**

In this output state, the values of `vx`, `ops`, `v1`, `v2`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `p2` is updated to include an additional integer if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise, the value of `p1` is updated to include an additional integer.
