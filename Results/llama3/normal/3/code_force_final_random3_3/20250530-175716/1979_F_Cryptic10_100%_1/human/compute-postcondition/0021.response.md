Output State: **`vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is an empty list, and stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5).**

In this output state, the values of `vx` and `ops` remain unchanged. The variable `p1` is assigned the value of `vx` converted to a list, so it contains the same two integers as `vx`. The variable `p2` is assigned an empty list. The stdin still contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5), as the code does not affect the input.
