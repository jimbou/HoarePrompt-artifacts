Output State: **`vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer and an additional integer `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the last tuple in the list, `stdin` contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the list `p2` has been appended with the integer `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` has been appended with `v1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
