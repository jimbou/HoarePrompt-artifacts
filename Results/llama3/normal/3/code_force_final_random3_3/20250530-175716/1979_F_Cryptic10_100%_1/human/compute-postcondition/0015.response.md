The only variable in the loop head is variable vx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable vx.  If vx has more than 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with three or four elements removed and must have more than 1 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time vx must have more than 2 elements.
State: **vx is a set of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) with three or four elements removed and must have more than 2 elements, v1 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) and is removed from vx, v2 is an integer from 1 to n (inclusive) or 0, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2), stdin contains at least 0 input: an integer (4 <= n <= 10^5). If v2 > 0, then ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) or two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, v2). Otherwise, ops is a list containing either a tuple of two integers (v1, v2) and two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0).**
