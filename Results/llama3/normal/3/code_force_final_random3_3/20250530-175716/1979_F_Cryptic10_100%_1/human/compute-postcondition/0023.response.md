Output State: **`vx` is a set containing two integers, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers, `p2` is a list containing either two integers or one integer, `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in the list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `p2` has been updated. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `p2` will contain two integers (the original empty list plus the appended `v1`). Otherwise, `p1` will remain unchanged and `p2` will contain one integer (the appended `v1`). The other variables remain unchanged.
