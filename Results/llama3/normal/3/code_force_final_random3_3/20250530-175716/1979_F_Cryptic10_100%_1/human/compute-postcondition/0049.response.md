Postcondition: ***vx is a set containing integers from 1 to n, excluding v1, v2, v3, and possibly other elements, where n is an integer greater than 3. If v2 > 0, vx has at least 2 elements and ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) and an additional tuple (v1, v2). Otherwise, vx has at least 1 element, ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and v3 is an integer. In both cases, p1 is a list containing two integers, p2 is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and _ is 1, v1 and v2 are integers.***
