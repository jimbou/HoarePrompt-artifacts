According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ops. If ops is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, vx is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, ops is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), p1 is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, p2 is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, and _ is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ops is not empty and (v1, v2) is the last element of ops.
State: **`vx` is a set containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list containing tuples of the form (v1, v2) or (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) that is not empty, `p1` is a list containing at most two integers from 1 to n, `p2` is an empty list, stdin contains at least -1 input: an integer, _ is 1, (v1, v2) is the last element of ops**
