#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5). The second line contains a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and then terminates with a return value of 0, without modifying the input or producing any output.
