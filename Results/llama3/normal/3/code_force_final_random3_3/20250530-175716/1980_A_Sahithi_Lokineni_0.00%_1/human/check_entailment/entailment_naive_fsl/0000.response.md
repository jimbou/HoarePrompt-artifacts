Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the number of problems in the bank (n) is less than the number of upcoming rounds (m). In this case, the program should output the difference between m and the number of unique difficulty levels in the bank, but the program does not do this.

For example, if the input is:

3
5 7
BGECDCBDED

The program should output 2, because Vlad needs to come up with 2 more problems of difficulty levels 'A' and 'F' to hold 7 rounds. However, the program will output 0, which is incorrect.

The program only checks if the number of problems of each difficulty level is less than or equal to m, but it does not consider the case when the total number of problems is less than m. To fix this, the program should add the difference between m and the number of unique difficulty levels in the bank to the answer.
