Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find a valid array of integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} for a given positive integer x. The program first converts the binary representation of x into a list of strings, where each string is either '0' or '1'. Then, it iterates through the list and applies the rules to ensure that there are no consecutive non-zero elements. If a '1' is found, it is replaced with '-1' and the next element is set to '0'. If the last element is '0' and the flag is set, it is replaced with '1'. Finally, the program prints the length of the array and the array itself.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where x is a power of 2 or x is 1. The program also handles the case where the binary representation of x has consecutive '1's.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
