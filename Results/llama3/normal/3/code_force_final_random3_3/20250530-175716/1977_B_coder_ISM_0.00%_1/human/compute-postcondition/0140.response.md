Output State: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 30 if flag is 0, otherwise i is 31, s is a list containing 30 elements if flag is 0, otherwise s is a list containing 31 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1'.
