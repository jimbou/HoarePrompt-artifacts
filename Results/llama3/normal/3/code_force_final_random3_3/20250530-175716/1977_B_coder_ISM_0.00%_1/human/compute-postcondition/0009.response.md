The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 30, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. `s` is a list containing one string '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise `s` is a list containing one string '0'.**
