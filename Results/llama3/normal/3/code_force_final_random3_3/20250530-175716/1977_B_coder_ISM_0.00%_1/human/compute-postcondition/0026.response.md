Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is less than 29, s is a list containing 30 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except s[i] which is '-1', flag is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `nalla` also remains unchanged at 0. The value of `x` remains a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1. The value of `length` remains 30. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `i` remains less than 29. The list `s` contains 30 strings, each representing a bit in the binary representation of `x`, except for `s[i]` which has been changed to '-1'. The value of `flag` has been changed to 1.
