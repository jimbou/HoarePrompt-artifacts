Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a positive integer x between 1 and 2^30 - 1. For each test case, it converts the integer to its binary representation as a list of strings, where each string is '1' if the corresponding bit is 1 and '0' otherwise. It then performs a series of transformations on the binary representation, including flipping bits and adding a new bit in certain cases. Finally, it prints the length of the transformed binary representation and the representation itself.**
