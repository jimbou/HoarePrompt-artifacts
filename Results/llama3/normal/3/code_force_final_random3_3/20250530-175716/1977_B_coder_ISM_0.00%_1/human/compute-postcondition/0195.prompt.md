Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 30, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and flag is 0, and the list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i, then an additional '1' has been appended to the end of s. Otherwise, an additional '0' has been appended to the end of s, and the list s is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is at least 0 and less than 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is updated to '1'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is updated to '-1'. Otherwise, the list s remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is at least 1 and less than 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is updated to '-1' and flag is set to 1. If flag is 1, then s[i] is set to '0' regardless of its previous value. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is updated to '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is at least 2 and less than 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[i] is '0'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is updated to '1'. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
