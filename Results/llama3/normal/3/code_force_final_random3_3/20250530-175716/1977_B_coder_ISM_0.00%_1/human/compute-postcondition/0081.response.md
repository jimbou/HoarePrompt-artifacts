The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 30, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing a single element which is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, which is 1, otherwise it is '0'.**
