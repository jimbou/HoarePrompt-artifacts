Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is at least 2 and less than 29, the length of `s` has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list `s` contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of `i`. If `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `s[i]` is '1' if `s[i]` was '0' or if `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, otherwise `s[i]` is '-1' and `flag` is set to 1.**
