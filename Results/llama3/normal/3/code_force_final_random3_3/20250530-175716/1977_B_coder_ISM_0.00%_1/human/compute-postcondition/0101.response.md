Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, where the first element is '0' and the remaining 29 elements are '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, otherwise they are '0', the length of `s` which is 30 has been printed, a list containing the 30 elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and the current value of `flag` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s[i]` has been updated to '0', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `s` now has its first element set to '0', and the remaining elements are determined by the bits of the current value of `x`.
