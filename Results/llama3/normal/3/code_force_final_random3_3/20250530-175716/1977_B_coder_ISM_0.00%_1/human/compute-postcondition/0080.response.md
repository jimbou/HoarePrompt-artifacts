Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing a single element which is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, which is 0, otherwise it is '0'. The length of `s` which is 1 is being printed, and a list containing the single element '1' or '0' is being printed.***
