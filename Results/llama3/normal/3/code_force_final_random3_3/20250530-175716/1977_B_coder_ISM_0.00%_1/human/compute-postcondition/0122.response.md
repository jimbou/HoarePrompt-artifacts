Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 29, s is a list containing 30 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', the length of s which is 30 has been printed, a list containing the 30 elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and flag is either 0 or 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of i, which is now 29, and the list s, which has been modified according to the loop's logic. The list s now contains '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0'. The length of s and the list containing the 30 elements '1' or '0' have been printed, and flag is either 0 or 1.
