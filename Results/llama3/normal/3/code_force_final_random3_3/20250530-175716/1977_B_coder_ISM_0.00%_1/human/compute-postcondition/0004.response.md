Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `s` is an empty list, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0. The current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & 2^i is true).***
