Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[i] is '0'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is updated to '1'. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1'. The current value of flag is 1.**
