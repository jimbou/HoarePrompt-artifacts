Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, s is a list containing 30 elements, where the first element is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the element at index i which is now '0', and flag is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the element at index i in the list s is now '0'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
