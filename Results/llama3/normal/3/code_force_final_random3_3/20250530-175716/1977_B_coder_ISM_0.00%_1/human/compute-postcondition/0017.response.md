Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 29, `s` is a list containing 30 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the string is '0'.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all 30 iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `nalla`, `x`, `length`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The loop variable `i` will be 29, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The list `s` will contain 30 strings, each representing a bit in the binary representation of `x`. If the bit at a particular position in `x` is 1, the corresponding string in `s` will be '1', otherwise it will be '0'.
