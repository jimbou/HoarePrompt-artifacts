Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing '1', and the length of `s` which is 1 is being printed, and a list containing '1' is being printed. The current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, which is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has changed from an empty list to a list containing the string '1'. The length of `s` has also changed from 0 to 1, and this new length is being printed. Additionally, a list containing '1' is being printed. The other variables remain unchanged.
