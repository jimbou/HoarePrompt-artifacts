Output: **a list of 30 or 31 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', with the first two elements possibly swapped and the third element possibly changed to '0' or '1' based on the values of s[i] and s[i - 1]**
