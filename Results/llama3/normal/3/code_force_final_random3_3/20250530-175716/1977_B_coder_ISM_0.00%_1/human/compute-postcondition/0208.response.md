Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 2, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. s[i] is '0', s[i - 1] is '-1', flag is 0, and s[29] is '1'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `nalla`, `x`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus three. The list `s` has been modified such that `s[i]` is now '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. The value of `flag` is 0, and `s[29]` is '1'. The length of `s` has been printed, and a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed.
