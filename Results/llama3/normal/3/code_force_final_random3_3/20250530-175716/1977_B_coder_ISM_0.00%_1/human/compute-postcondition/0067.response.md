Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is greater than 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for `s[i]` which is either '0' if `s[i]` was '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1', otherwise `s[i]` is '1' if flag is 0, otherwise `s[i]` is '1' if flag is 1, otherwise `s[i]` is '1', and either flag is 0 or `s[29]` is '1', and if flag is 1, the current value of `s[29]` is '1'.***
