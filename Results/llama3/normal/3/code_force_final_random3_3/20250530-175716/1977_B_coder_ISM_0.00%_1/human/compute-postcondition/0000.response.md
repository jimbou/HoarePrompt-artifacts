The code accepts an integer input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a single positive integer x. Since `t` is assigned the first integer input, the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t < 2^30), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a single positive integer x (1 <= x < 2^30)**
