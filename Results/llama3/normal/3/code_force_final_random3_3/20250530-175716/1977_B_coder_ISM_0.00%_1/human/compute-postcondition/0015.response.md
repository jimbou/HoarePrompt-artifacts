Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing three strings: the first string is '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the first string is '0', the second string is '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the second string is '0', and the third string is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending '0' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains three strings, where the first two strings are determined by the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x`, and the third string is always '0'.
