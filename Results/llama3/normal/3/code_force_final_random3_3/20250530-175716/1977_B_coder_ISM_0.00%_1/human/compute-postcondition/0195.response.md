Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[i] is '0'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is updated to '1'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the variables have reached their final values. The variable `i` has reached 29, which is the last iteration of the loop. The list `s` contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of `i`. The flag variable is either 0 or 1, depending on the previous values of `s[i]` and `s[i+1]`. If the flag is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i+1]`, then `s[i]` is '-1' and the flag is set to 1. Otherwise, if the flag is 1, then `s[i]` is '0'. If the flag is 0 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is updated to '1'.
