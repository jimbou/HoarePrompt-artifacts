Output State: **The program's state remains unchanged if the current bit of x at position 2^i is not set and the previous bit is not set, or if the current bit is set and the previous bit is not set. However, if the current bit is not set and the previous bit is set, then the current bit is set to 0, the previous bit is set to -1, and the flag is set to 0. In all cases, t remains a positive integer greater than 2, nalla remains 2, x remains a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length remains greater than 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 3, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, s[29] remains '1', s[3] is '0', and s[2] is '-1'.**
