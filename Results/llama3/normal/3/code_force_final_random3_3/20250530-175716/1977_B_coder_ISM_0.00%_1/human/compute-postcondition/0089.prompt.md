Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 29, s is an empty list, and the length of s which is 0 is being printed, and an empty list is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing a single element which is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, which is 0, otherwise it is '0'. The length of `s` which is 1 is being printed, and a list containing the single element '1' or '0' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing two elements, the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, which is 1, otherwise it is '0'. The second element of `s` is '1' if the bit at the position corresponding to the value of `i` in `x` is set, otherwise it is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing three elements, the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, which is 2, otherwise it is '0'. The second element of `s` is '1' if the bit at the position corresponding to the value of `i` in `x` is set, otherwise it is '0'. The third element of `s` is '1' if the bit at the position corresponding to the value of `i` in `x` is set, otherwise it is '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
