Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 29, s is a list containing 30 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', the length of s which is 30 is being printed, a list containing the 30 elements '1' or '0' is being printed, and flag is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is a list containing 30 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is either '-1' if flag is 0 and the first two elements of s are '1', or '0' if flag is 1, otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', the length of s which is 30 has been printed, a list containing the 30 elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and flag is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, s is a list containing 30 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', and flag is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, s is a list containing 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', and if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', then s[2] is '-1', otherwise if flag is 1, the element at index i is now '0', and flag is either 0 or 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
