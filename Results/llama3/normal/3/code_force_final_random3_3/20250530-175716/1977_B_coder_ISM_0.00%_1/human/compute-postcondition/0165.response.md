Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 30, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and flag is 0, and the list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i, then an additional '1' has been appended to the end of s. Otherwise, an additional '0' has been appended to the end of s, and the list s is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of flag has been changed to 0. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list s still contains either '1' or '0' depending on the bits of x, and it has been printed. The length of s has also been printed. The program is still waiting for multiple test cases minus three from the standard input.
