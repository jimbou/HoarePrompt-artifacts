Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 29, s is a list containing 30 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for s[i] which is '1' if flag is 0 and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise s[i] is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 0, otherwise s[i] is '1', and flag is 1, and the current value of s[29] is '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of s[29] has been updated to '1'. All other variables remain unchanged. The list s still contains 30 strings representing the binary representation of x, except for the last element s[29] which is now '1'. The values of t, nalla, x, length, stdin, i, and flag remain the same as before.
