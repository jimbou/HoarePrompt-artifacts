Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is equal to length, s is an empty list, flag is 0, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 0, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1'. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 1, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1'. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i, then an additional '1' has been appended to the end of s. Otherwise, an additional '0' has been appended to the end of s.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 2, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1'. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i, then an additional '1' has been appended to the end of s. Otherwise, an additional '0' has been appended to the end of s.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
