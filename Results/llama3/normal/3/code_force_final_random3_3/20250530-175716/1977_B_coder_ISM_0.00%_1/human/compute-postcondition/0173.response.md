Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is at least 0 and less than 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and the current value of flag is 1. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If s[i] is '0', then s[i] is updated to '1'. Additionally, s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.***
