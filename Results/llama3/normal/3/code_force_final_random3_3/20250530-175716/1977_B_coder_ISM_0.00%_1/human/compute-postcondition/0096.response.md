Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is a list containing 30 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', the length of s which is 30 has been printed, a list containing the 30 elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and the element at index i of s is '0', then the element at index i of s is '1'.***
