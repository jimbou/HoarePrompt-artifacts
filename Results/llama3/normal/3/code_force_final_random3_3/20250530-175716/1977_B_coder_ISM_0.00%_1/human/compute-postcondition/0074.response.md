Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 29, s is an empty list, and the length of s which is 0 is being printed, and an empty list is being printed.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was already a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, its value remains the same. The second line initializes an empty list `s`. The third line assigns the value 30 to `length`. The value of `length` was previously either 30 or 31, but it is now specifically 30. The values of `t`, `nalla`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The length of `s` is now 0, and an empty list is being printed.
