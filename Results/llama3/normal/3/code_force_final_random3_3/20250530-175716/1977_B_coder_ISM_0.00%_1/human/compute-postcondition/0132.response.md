Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, s is a list containing 30 elements if flag is 0, otherwise s is a list containing 31 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1'. The current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'.**

The code modifies the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]`. Initially, `s[i]` was '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1'. After the first line, `s[i]` becomes '0'. After the second line, `s[i - 1]` becomes '-1'. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
