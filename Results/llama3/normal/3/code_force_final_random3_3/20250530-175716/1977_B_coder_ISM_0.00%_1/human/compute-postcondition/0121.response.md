Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, s is a list containing 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', and if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', then s[2] is '-1', otherwise if flag is 1, the element at index i is now '0', and flag is either 0 or 1.**
