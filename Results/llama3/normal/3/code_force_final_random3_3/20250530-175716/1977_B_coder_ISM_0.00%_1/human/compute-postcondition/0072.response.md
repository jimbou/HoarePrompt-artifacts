Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30 or 31, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 29, s is a list containing 30 or 31 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for s[i] which is either '0' if s[i] was '-1' and s[i - 1] was '1', otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 0, otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 1, otherwise s[i] is '1', and either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, the current value of s[29] is '1', and the length of s which is either 30 or 31 is being printed, and the following is printed: a list of 30 or 31 strings representing the binary representation of x, where each string is either '1' or '0' except for s[i] which is either '0' or '1' based on the conditions described above**
