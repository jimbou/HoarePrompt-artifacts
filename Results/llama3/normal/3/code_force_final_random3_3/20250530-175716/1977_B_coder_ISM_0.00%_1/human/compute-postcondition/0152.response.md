Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 0, s is a list containing 1 element '0', flag is 0, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1', and x does not have a bit set at position i**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains a positive integer greater than 2, nalla remains 2, x remains a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length remains 30, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three, i remains 0, s is now a list containing one element '0', flag remains 0, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1', and x does not have a bit set at position i.
