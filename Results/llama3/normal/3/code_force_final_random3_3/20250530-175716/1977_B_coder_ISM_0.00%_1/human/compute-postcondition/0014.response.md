Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing three strings: the first string is '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the first string is '0', the second string is '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the second string is '0', and the third string is '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` remains 0, `x` remains a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` remains 30, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` remains 2, and `s` is now a list of three strings. The first two strings in `s` still represent the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x`, and the third string is always '1'.
