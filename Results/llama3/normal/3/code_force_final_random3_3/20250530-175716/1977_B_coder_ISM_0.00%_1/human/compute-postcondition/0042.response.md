To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` since it is the only variable in the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than 30. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 29. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we can increment `i` by 1 to get the new state.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is less than 29, s is a list containing 30 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for s[i] which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', otherwise s[i] is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 0.**
