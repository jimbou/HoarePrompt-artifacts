Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, s is a list containing 30 or 31 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for s[i] which is '0', and s[i - 1] which is '-1'.**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `nalla` also remains unchanged at 0. The value of `x` remains a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1. The value of `length` remains greater than 2. The number of test cases in stdin remains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `i` remains 2. The list `s` contains 30 or 31 strings, where each string corresponds to the binary representation of `x`, except for the string at index `i` which is now '0', and the string at index `i - 1` which is now '-1'.
