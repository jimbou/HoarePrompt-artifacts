Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 1, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1'. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i, and an additional '0' has been appended to the end of s.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the list s now has an extra '0' at the end. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
