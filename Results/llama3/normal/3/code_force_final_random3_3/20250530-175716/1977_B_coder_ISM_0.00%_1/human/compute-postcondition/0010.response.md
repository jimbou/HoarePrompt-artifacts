Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. `s` is a list containing two strings: '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise '0', and '1'**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `nalla`, `x`, `length`, `stdin`, and `i` remains the same. However, the list `s` now contains two strings: the first string is '1' if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise '0', and the second string is always '1'.
