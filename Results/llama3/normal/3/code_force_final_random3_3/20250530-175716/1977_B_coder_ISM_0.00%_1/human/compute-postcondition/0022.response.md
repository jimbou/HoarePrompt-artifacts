Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is less than 29, `s` is a list containing 30 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the string is '0', `flag` is 1, and the binary representation of `x` is being printed. The current value of `flag` is 1 and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'***
