The code prints the elements of the list `s` separated by spaces. The list `s` contains 30 strings, each representing a bit in the binary representation of the positive integer `x`. The value of `x` is between 1 and 2^30 - 1.

Output: **the binary representation of x as a sequence of 30 '1's and '0's**
