Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is at least 0 and less than 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and the current value of flag is 1, and the list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i, then an additional '1' has been appended to the end of s. Otherwise, an additional '0' has been appended to the end of s, and the list s is printed. Additionally, the current value of s[i] is '0'.**
