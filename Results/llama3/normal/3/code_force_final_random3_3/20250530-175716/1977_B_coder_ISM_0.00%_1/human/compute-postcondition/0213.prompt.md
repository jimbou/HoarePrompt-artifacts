Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then s[29] is '0' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[29] is '1'. If flag is 0, then either s[29] is '1' or flag is 0 and s[i] is updated according to the given conditions.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 1, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0', s[i - 1] is '-1', flag is 0, and s[29] is '1'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program's state remains unchanged if the current bit of x at position 2^i is not set and the previous bit is not set, or if the current bit is set and the previous bit is not set. However, if the current bit is not set and the previous bit is set, then the current bit is set to 0, the previous bit is set to -1, and the flag is set to 0. In all cases, t remains a positive integer greater than 2, nalla remains 2, x remains a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length remains greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i remains 2, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and s[29] remains '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program's state remains unchanged if the current bit of x at position 2^i is not set and the previous bit is not set, or if the current bit is set and the previous bit is not set. However, if the current bit is not set and the previous bit is set, then the current bit is set to 0, the previous bit is set to -1, and the flag is set to 0. In all cases, t remains a positive integer greater than 2, nalla remains 2, x remains a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length remains greater than 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 3, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and s[29] remains '1'. Additionally, if s[i] equals '-1' and s[i - 1] equals '1', then s[3] is '0' and s[2] is '-1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
