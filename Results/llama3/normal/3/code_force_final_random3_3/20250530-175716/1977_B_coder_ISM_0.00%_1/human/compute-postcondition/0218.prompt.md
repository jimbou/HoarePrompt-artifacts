Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t < 2^30), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a single positive integer x (1 <= x < 2^30)
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30 or 31, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 29, s is a list containing 30 or 31 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for s[i] which is either '0' if s[i] was '-1' and s[i - 1] was '1', otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 0, otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 1, otherwise s[i] is '1', and either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, the current value of s[29] is '1', and the length of s which is either 30 or 31 is being printed, and the following is printed: a list of 30 or 31 strings representing the binary representation of x, where each string is either '1' or '0' except for s[i] which is either '0' or '1' based on the conditions described above

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is equal to length, s is a list containing 30 elements if flag is 0, otherwise s is a list containing 31 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', except for the first element which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise it is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise it is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', otherwise each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of i, otherwise it is '0', the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed, and either flag is 0 or flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, then s[30] is '1'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[2] is '0' and s[1] is '-1', otherwise s[2] is '-1' and s[1] is '1', s[3] is '0', and s[2] is '-1' if s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', otherwise s[3] is '1' and s[2] is '1', and so on until s[length - 1] is '0' and s[length - 2] is '-1' if s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', otherwise s[length - 1] is '1' and s[length - 2] is '1', and the length which is greater than 1 is being printed, and the list s is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is length - 1, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0', s[i - 1] is '-1', flag is 0, and s[29] is '1'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the list s is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
