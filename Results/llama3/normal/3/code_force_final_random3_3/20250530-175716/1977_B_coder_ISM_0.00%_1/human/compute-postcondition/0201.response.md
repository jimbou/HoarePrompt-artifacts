Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 29, the length of s has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list s contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of x has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of i. If flag is 1, then s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1', and flag is 1. If flag is 0, then either s[29] is '1' or flag is 0 and s[i] is updated according to the given conditions.***
