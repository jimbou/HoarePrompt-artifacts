The code prints the length of the list `s` which is 30, and a list containing the 30 elements '1' or '0' is being printed. The elements of the list `s` are '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, otherwise they are '0'. Since `i` is 29, the list `s` contains the binary representation of the value of `x` in reverse order.

Output: **30, ['1' or '0'] (where '1' or '0' are the binary digits of the value of x in reverse order)**
