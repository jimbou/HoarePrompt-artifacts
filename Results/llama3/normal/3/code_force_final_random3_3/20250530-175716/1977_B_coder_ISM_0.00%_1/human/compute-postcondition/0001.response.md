According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t < 2^30) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and nalla is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, nalla is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a single positive integer x (1 <= x < 2^30)**
