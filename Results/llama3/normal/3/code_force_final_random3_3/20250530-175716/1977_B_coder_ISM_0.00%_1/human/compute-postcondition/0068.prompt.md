Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is 30 or 31, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 29, s is a list containing 30 or 31 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for s[i] which is '-1' if flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i + 1] is '1', otherwise s[i] is '0' if flag is 1, otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 0, otherwise s[i] is '1', and either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, the current value of s[29] is '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for s[i] which is either '0' if s[i] was '-1' and s[i - 1] was '1', otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 0, otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 1, otherwise s[i] is '1', and either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, the current value of s[29] is '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, length is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, s is a list containing 30 or 31 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of x is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for s[i] which is either '0' if s[i] was '-1' and s[i - 1] was '1', otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 0, otherwise s[i] is '1' if flag is 1, otherwise s[i] is '1', and either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1', and if flag is 1, the current value of s[29] is '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is greater than 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the string is '0', except for `s[i]` which is either '0' if `s[i]` was '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1', otherwise `s[i]` is '1' if flag is 0, otherwise `s[i]` is '1' if flag is 1, otherwise `s[i]` is '1', and either flag is 0 or `s[29]` is '1', and if flag is 1, the current value of `s[29]` is '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
