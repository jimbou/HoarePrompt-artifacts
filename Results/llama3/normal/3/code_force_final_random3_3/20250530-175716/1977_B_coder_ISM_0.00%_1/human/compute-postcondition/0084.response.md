Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing two elements, the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the value of `i`, which is 1, otherwise it is '0'. The second element of `s` is '1' if the bit at the position corresponding to the value of `i` in `x` is set, otherwise it is '0'.***
