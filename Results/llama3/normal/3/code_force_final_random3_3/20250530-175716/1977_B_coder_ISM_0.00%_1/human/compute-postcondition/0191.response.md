Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is at least 2 and less than 29, the length of `s` has been printed, a list containing the elements '1' or '0' has been printed. The list `s` contains either '1' or '0' depending on whether the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position corresponding to 2 raised to the power of `i`. `s[i]` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s[i]` has been updated to '0', while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
