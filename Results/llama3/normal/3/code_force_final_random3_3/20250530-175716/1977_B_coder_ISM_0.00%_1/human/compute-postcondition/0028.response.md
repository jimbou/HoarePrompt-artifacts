Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^30 - 1, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is less than 29, `s` is a list containing 30 strings: each string is '1' if the bit at the corresponding position in the binary representation of `x` is 1, otherwise the string is '0', if `flag` was 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then the current value of `s[i]` is '1' and the current value of `flag` is 0, otherwise nothing changes, and the binary representation of `x` is being printed. Additionally, the current value of `flag` is 1, and either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is '0'.**
