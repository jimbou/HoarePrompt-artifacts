To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `eta_ln`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `eta_ln`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `eta_ln` is at least 2. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `eta_ln` remains the same, which is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is at least 2, `rho` is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[j], `res` is q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**
