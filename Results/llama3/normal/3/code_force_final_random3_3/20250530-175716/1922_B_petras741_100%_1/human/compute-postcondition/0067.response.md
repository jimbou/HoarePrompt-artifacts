Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is n and the rest are 0, j is n+1, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, rho is n, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `eta` is also unchanged, as it still contains all the indices `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0. The new variables `eta_ln` and `rho` are introduced, where `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, and `rho` is the value of `q` at the first index in `eta`, which is `n`. The state of `stdin` is also updated to reflect that two lines have been consumed.
