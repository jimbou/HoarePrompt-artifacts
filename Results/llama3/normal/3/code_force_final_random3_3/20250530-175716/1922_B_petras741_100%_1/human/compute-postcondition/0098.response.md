To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0 (since the range is `n + 1`), and `j` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` for `j` in range `n`, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**
