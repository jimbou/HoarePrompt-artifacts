Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` are all 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before, `j` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `i`, `buffer`, and `n` as in the initial state. The list `w` will remain unchanged. The list `q` will have all its elements set to 1, except for the last one which will remain 0. The variable `j` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
