Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**

In this output state, the variable `q` has been assigned a list of `n+1` zeros, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
