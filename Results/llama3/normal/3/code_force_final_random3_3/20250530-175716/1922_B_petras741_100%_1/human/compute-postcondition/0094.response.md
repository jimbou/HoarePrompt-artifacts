To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `j` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the rest are 0 except the value at index `w[1]` which is 1, `j` is 2**
