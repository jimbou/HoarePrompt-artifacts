To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `eta_ln`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `eta_ln`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `eta_ln` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `eta_ln` remains the same, but since we know it's at least 2, we can conclude that it's at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`, and `res`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is n and the rest are 0, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is at least 3, `rho` is n + q[eta[j]], `res` is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (n + q[eta[j]])**
