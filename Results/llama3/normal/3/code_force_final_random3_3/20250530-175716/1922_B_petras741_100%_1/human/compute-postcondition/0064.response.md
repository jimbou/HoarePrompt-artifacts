Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing the single element 2 and 3. stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value of `j`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
