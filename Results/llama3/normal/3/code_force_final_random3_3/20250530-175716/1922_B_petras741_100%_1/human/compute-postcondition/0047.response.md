To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers, and `q` is a list of n+1 zeros, we can infer that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 zeros, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**
