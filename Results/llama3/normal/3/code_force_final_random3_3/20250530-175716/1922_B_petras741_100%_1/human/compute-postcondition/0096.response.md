Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` for `j` in range `n`, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `buffer` remains an empty list, `n` remains an integer greater than 0, `w` remains a list of integers from the input, and `q` becomes a list of `n+1` integers where the value at each index `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration `j` in the range `n`. The loop counter `j` ends at `n-1`, and the stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
