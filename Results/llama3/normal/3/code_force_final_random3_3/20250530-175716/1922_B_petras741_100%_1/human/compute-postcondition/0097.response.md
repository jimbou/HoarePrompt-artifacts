Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` for `j` in range `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `eta` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `eta` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
