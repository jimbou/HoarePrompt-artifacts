Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[j]]` is 2 and the rest are 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `q[w[j]]` being 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
