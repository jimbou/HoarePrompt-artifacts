Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` are all 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `eta` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
