Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` are all 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 2. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `buffer` is a list containing 1 and `eta` is a list containing 2. Otherwise, `buffer` is an empty list.***
