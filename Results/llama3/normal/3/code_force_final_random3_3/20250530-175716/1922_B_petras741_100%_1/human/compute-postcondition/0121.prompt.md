Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, `j` is n, `eta` is a list containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of eta, `rho` is the value of q at index eta[0], `res` is q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before, and eta_ln is not equal to 1
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers from the input, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, j is 1, eta is a list containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[j], res is q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers from the input, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, j is 2, eta is a list containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[j] plus q[eta[j]], res is q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[j]]) plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers from the input, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, j is 3, eta is a list containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[j] plus q[eta[j]] plus q[eta[j]], res is q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[j]]) plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
