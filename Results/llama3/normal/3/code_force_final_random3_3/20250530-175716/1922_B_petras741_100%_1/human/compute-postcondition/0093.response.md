Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the rest are 0 except the value at index `w[1]` which is 1, `j` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1. Since `j` is 1, `w[j]` is `w[1]`. The value at index `w[1]` in `q` was initially 0, so it is now 1. The value at index `w[0]` in `q` was initially 1, so it is now 2. The other values in `q` remain 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
