Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` are all 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the indices of `q` that are greater than 0, `j` is `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, and `q` remain unchanged. The variable `eta` is a list containing all the indices of `q` that are greater than 0, which are the indices of the elements in `w`. The variable `j` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n+1` times.
