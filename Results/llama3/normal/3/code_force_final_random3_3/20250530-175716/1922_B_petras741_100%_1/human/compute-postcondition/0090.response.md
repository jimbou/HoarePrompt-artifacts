The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer from the input does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**
