Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers from the input, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, j is 1, eta is a list containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[j], res is q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**

The code block modifies the values of `res` and `rho`. The first line adds the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to `res`. The second line adds the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to `res`. The third line increments `rho` by the value of `q[eta[j]]`. No other variables are affected.
