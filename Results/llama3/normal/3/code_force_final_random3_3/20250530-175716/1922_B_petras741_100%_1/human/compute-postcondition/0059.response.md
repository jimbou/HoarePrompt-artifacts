Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `j` is 0, if `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the single element 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.***
