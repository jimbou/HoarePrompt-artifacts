Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line less than before
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before. If n is greater than or equal to 3, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, j is n if eta_ln is 1, otherwise j is equal to eta_ln, eta_ln is the number of elements in eta, rho is 1 if eta_ln is 1, otherwise rho is the sum of q[eta[1]] to q[eta[eta_ln-1]], and the value of n*(n-1)*(n-2) divided by 6 is printed if eta_ln is 1, otherwise res is the original value of res plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (j-1 plus q[eta[j]]) for j from 1 to eta_ln-1, and res is printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before. If n is less than 3, the number 0 is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where q[w[j]] is n and the rest are 0, j is either n+1 or eta_ln, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, rho is either n or n + sum(q[eta[j]] for j in range(1, eta_ln)), and the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements, which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 is printed if eta_ln is 1, otherwise res is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 + sum(q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (n + sum(q[eta[k]] for k in range(1, j))) for j in range(1, eta_ln)) and res is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer from the input, w is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before. If n is less than 3, the number 0 is being printed. If n is at least 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, and a list eta containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0 is created. If the length of eta is 1, the number of combinations of 3 items that can be chosen from a set of n items is being printed. Otherwise, the length of eta is at least 2, and the result of a calculation involving the values in q and eta is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
