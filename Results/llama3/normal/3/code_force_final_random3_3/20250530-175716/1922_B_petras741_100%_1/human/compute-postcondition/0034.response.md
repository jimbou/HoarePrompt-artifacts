To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `j` and `eta_ln`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `eta_ln`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `eta_ln` is larger than 2.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1, so `j` becomes 3. The value of `eta_ln` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is still larger than the new value of `j`, which is 3.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, `j` is 3, `eta_ln` is larger than 3, `rho` is 2 plus q[eta[j]], `res` is the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 plus q[eta[j]])**
