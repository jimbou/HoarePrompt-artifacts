Output: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is n and the rest are 0, j is eta_ln, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of indices j where q[j] is greater than 0 and is not equal to 1, rho is n + sum(q[eta[j]] for j in range(1, eta_ln)), and res is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 + sum(q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (n + sum(q[eta[k]] for k in range(1, j))) for j in range(1, eta_ln)) and res is printed**
