Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer from the input, w is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `w`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `buffer` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer from the input, and the value of `w` is updated to the list of integers from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by two.
