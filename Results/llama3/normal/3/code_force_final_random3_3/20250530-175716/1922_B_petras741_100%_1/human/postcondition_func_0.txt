This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers. The function then calculates and prints the number of combinations of 3 items that can be chosen from the set of n items, considering the frequency of each item. If n is less than 3, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
