Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is 1, `q[w[2]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[2]]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
