To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `eta_ln`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `eta_ln`. If `eta_ln` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `eta_ln` is the number of indices `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0 and is not equal to 1, which is not guaranteed to be at least 2. So, we need to adjust `eta_ln` to be at least 2 and `j` to be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[j]]` is n and the rest are 0, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all the indices j where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is at least 2, `rho` is n, `res` is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**
