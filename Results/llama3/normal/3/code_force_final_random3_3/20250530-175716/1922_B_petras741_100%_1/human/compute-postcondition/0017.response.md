The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and `n` remains greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` are all 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 1**
