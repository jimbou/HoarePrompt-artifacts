The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` for `j` in range `n`, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing the value 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**
