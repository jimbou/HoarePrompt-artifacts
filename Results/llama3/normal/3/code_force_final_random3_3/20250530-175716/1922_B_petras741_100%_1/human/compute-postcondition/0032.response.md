State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, j is 2, eta_ln is larger than 2, rho is 1 plus q[eta[j]], res is the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho**
