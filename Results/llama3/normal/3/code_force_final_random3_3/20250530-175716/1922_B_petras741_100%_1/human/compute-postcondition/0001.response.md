According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line less than before does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with one line less than before**
