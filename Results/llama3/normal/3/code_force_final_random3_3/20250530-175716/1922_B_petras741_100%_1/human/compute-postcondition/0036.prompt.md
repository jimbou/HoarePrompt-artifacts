Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, `j` is n, `eta_ln` is the number of elements in eta, `rho` is 1, `eta_ln` is larger than 1, `res` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, j is 1, eta_ln is larger than 1, rho is 1 plus q[eta[j]], res is the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, j is 2, eta_ln is larger than 2, rho is 2 plus q[eta[j]], res is the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (1 plus q[eta[j]])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, j is 3, eta_ln is larger than 3, rho is 4 plus q[eta[j]], res is the original value of res plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (3 plus q[eta[j]])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
