Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before. If n is less than 3, the number 0 is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where q[w[j]] is n and the rest are 0, j is either n+1 or eta_ln, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, rho is either n or n + sum(q[eta[j]] for j in range(1, eta_ln)), and the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements, which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 is printed if eta_ln is 1, otherwise res is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 + sum(q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (n + sum(q[eta[k]] for k in range(1, j))) for j in range(1, eta_ln)) and res is printed.***
