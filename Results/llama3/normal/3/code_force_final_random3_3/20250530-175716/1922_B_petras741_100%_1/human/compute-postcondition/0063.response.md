The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `j` is 3. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the single element 2. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list. stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**
