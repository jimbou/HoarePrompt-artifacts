The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a formula to calculate the number of combinations of 3 items from a set of `n` items.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, the value of `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` will be an integer.

However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Output: **n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 0)**
