To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `eta_ln`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `eta_ln` is greater than 1 and `j` is in the range from 1 to `eta_ln-1`. Since `eta_ln` is already larger than 1, we need to adjust `j` to be within this range.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, `eta` is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, `j` is 1, `eta_ln` is larger than 1, `rho` is 1, `res` is 0**
