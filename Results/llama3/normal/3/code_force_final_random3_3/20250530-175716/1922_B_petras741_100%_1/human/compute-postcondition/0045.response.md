Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**

The code snippet reads two lines from stdin, assigning the first line to `n` and the second line to `w`. The values of `t`, `i`, and the buffer remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value read from stdin, and the value of `w` is updated to the list of integers read from stdin. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by two.
