Output: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[0]], q[w[1]], ..., q[w[n-1]] are all 1 and the rest are 0, eta is a list containing all the indices of q that are greater than 0, j is equal to eta_ln, eta_ln is larger than 1, rho is the sum of q[eta[1]] to q[eta[eta_ln-1]], and res is the original value of res plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (j-1 plus q[eta[j]]) for j from 1 to eta_ln-1, and res is printed**
