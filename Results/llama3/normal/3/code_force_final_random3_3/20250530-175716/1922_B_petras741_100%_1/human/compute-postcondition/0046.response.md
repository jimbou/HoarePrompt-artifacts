Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged. A new variable `q` is introduced, which is a list of `n+1` zeros. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
