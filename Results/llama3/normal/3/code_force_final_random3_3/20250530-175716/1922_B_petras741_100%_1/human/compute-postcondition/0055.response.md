Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[j]]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `j` is `n`, `eta` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `eta` which is an empty list. The values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
