Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[j]]` is `n` and the rest are 0, `j` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `i`, and `buffer` as in the initial state. The value of `n` will remain unchanged, and `w` will still be a list of integers. The list `q` will have all its elements set to 0, except for the element at index `w[j]`, which will be set to `n`. The loop variable `j` will have the value `n`. The stdin will contain multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
