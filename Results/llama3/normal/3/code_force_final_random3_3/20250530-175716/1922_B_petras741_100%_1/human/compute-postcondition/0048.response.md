Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[j]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1, where `w[j]` is the index of the list `w` at position `j`, which is 0. The rest of the values in the list `q` remain 0. The other variables, `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, and `w`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
