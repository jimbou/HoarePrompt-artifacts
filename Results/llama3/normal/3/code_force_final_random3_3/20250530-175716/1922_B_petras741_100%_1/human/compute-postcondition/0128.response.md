Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer from the input, w is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before. If n is less than 3, the number 0 is being printed. If n is at least 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, and a list eta containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0 is created. If the length of eta is 1, the number of combinations of 3 items that can be chosen from a set of n items is being printed. Otherwise, the length of eta is at least 2, and the result of a calculation involving the values in q and eta is being printed.***
