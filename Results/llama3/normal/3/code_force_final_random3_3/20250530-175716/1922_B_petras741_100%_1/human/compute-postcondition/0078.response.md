Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is n and the rest are 0, j is 3, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is n + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]], res is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (n + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]])**

The code modifies the values of `res` and `rho`. The first line increments `res` by the product of `q[eta[j]]`, `q[eta[j]] - 1`, and `q[eta[j]] - 2`, all divided by 6. The second line increments `res` by the product of `q[eta[j]]`, `q[eta[j]] - 1`, and `rho`, all divided by 2. The third line increments `rho` by `q[eta[j]]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
