The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where `q[w[j]]` is 2 and the rest are 0, `j` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before**
