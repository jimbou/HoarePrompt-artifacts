Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers from the input, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, j is n, eta is a list containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta, rho is the value of q at index eta[0], stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before. If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 items that can be chosen from a set of n items is being printed. Otherwise, eta_ln is at least 2, j is eta_ln - 1, rho is the sum of q[eta[j]] for j in range eta_ln, res is the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 for j in range eta_ln plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (rho - q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j-1]]) for j in range 1 to eta_ln, and the result of the calculation of res is being printed.***
