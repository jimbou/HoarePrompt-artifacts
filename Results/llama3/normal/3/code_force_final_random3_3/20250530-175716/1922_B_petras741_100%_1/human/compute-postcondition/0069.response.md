The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a mathematical formula for calculating the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, also known as the number of 3-combinations of a set with `n` elements.

In this case, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, so the result will be a non-negative integer.

Output: **n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 0)**
