Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is `j+1` for `j` in range `n`, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing the value 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` contains the value 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value 3, since `j` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
