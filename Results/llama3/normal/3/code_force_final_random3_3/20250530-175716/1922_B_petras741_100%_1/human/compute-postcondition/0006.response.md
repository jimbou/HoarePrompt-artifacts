Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before, `j` is 0**

The value of `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is 0, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.
