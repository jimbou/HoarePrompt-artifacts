Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers from the input, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is j+1 for j in range n, j is n, eta is a list containing the values j for j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the length of eta, and the current value of eta_ln is 1, rho is the value of q at index eta[0], stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before.***
