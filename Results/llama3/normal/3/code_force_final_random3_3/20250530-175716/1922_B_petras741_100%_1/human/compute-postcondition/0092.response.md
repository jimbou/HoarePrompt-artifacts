To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(n):`. The objects involved are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` by 1, so `j` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `w`, and `q`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 1**
