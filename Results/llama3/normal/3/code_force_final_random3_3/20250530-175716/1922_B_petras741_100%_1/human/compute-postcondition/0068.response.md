Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, buffer is an empty list, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where q[w[j]] is n and the rest are 0, j is n+1, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is 1, rho is n, stdin contains multiple test cases with two lines less than before. The current value of eta_ln is 1, meaning there is only one index j where q[j] is greater than 0.**
