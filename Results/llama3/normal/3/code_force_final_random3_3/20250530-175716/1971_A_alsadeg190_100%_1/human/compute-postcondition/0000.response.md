The code `x = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `x`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). The first input is an integer t, so `x` is assigned the value of t.

The values of the other variables are not affected. Since `x` is assigned the value of t, the remaining inputs in stdin are t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).**
