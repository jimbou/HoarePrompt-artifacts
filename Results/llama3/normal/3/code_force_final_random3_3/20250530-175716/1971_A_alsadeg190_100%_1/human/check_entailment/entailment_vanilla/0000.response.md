Reasoning:

The problem requires the program to take two integers x and y as input and output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. The program uses a for loop to iterate over the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes two integers x and y as input. It then uses an if-else statement to determine which number is smaller and prints the smaller number followed by the larger number.

The program correctly handles the cases where x is less than y, x is greater than y, and x is equal to y. The use of the if-else statement ensures that the smaller number is always printed first, followed by the larger number.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It takes the number of test cases as input, followed by the two integers x and y for each test case, and outputs the minimum and maximum of x and y for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
