Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers and prints them in ascending order.

The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine which integer is smaller and which is larger. If x is smaller than y, it prints x followed by y. Otherwise, it prints y followed by x. This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

The execution summary also confirms that the program reads a series of pairs of integers and prints each pair in ascending order, which is the expected behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
