The code prints the values of `y` and `x`. Since `x` and `y` are integers and `x` is not less than `y`, we can conclude that `x` is either greater than or equal to `y`. However, the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed.

Output: **y (an integer), x (an integer greater than or equal to y)**
