Based on the initial state, `x` and `y` are integers, but their specific values are not provided. The variable `i` is set to 1, but it is not used in the print statement. Since `stdin` contains no input, there is no external data that could affect the output.

The print statement `print(y, x)` will print the values of `y` and `x` in that order, separated by a space.

Output: **y (the value of y), x (the value of x)**
