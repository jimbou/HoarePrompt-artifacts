Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t - x lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). The values of `x` and `y` are printed in ascending order for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `x` remains unchanged, and the standard input contains the remaining lines that were not processed by the loop. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `x` and `y` are printed in ascending order.
