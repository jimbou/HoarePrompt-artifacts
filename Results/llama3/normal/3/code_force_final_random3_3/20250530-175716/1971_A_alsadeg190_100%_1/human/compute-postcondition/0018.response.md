Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to be the two integers from the input, which are split by a space and converted to integers using the `map` function. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. Since the input is consumed by the `input()` function, the stdin is now empty.
