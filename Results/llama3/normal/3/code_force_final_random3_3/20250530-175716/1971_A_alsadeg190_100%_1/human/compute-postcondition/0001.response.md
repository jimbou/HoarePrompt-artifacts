To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), we can adjust the state of `x` to be at least 1.

The state of `i` is not explicitly defined before the loop, but since it is the loop variable, we can adjust its state to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

The state of `stdin` is not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`x` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
