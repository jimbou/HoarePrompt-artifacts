Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the number of test cases as input, and for each test case, it takes two integers x and y as input. It then prints the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y. The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine which number is smaller and which is larger, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when x and y are equal, or when x or y is 0. The program's logic is straightforward and easy to follow, and it does not contain any obvious errors or omissions.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
