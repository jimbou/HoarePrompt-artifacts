Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `mak` is 0, so it will be printed as 0.
* `mak` is 0, so it will be printed as 0 again.
* `i` is 1, so it will be printed as 1.
* `i` is 1, so it will be printed as 1 again.

Therefore, the output will be a string with the characters '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`, which are all known.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
