Output State: **n is at least 3, i is 2, s is a string containing the user's input, mak is 2, pans is [2]**.

The code modifies the values of `mak` and `pans`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, making `mak` equal to 2. The second line assigns a new list containing only the value of `i` to `pans`, making `pans` equal to [2]. The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.
