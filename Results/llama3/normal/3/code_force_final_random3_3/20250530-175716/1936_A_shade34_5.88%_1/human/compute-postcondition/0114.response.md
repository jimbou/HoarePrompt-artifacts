The code `pans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `pans`. Since `i` is 1, the list `pans` becomes `[0, 1]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `pans` is [0, 1], `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, stdin is empty**
