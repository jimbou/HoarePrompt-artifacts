The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2` again.
Since `mak` is 0, `mak2` has been printed and flushed to the console, and `i` is 1, the output will contain these values.
Output: **? 0 [mak2] 1 [mak2] (where [mak2] is the value of mak2 that has been printed and flushed to the console)**
