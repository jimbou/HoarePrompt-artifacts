To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

The initial state provides the following information:

- `n` is at least 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements.
- `s` is a string containing the user's input (not used in the print statement).
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is `n-1` (not used in the print statement).

The Python code snippet contains a `print` statement with the following expression:

```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Now, let's substitute the given values into the expression:

- `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list, i.e., 0.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[1]`, which is the second element of the `pans` list, i.e., 1.

So, the expression becomes:

```python
print('?', 0, 0, 1, 1)
```

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
