Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least n, i is n-1, mak is n-1, _ is 0, mak2 is n-1, pans is an empty list, the output ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] is displayed on the screen where [mak] is n-1 and [i] is n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, i is 0, s is a string containing the user's input. If s is '<', then the current value of s is '<', '?' ,mak is 0, pans is [0], and mak2 has been printed and flushed to the console. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the program remains unchanged, with '?' ,mak, mak2, 0, mak2 having been printed and flushed to the console.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, i is 1, and the value '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2 which is 0 have been printed and flushed to the console. If s is '<', then s is '<', mak is 1, and pans is [1]. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0 if mak is 0, or a list containing the values 0 and 1 if mak is 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the program remains unchanged, with mak being 1 if s was '<' before, and mak being 0 otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing a single character read from stdin, stdin is empty, if s is '<', then mak is 2, mak2 is 0, and pans is [2]. If s is not '<', then mak is 1 if s is '<' or if s is neither '<' nor '=' and mak was '<' before, mak is 0 if s is '=' or if s is neither '<' nor '=' and mak was not '<' before, mak2 is 0, and pans is [1, 2] if s is '<', [0, 2] if s is '=' and mak is 0, [0, 1, 2] if s is '=' and mak is 1, or unchanged and appended with 2 if s is neither '<' nor '='. The value of mak, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2 which is 0 have been printed and flushed to the console.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
