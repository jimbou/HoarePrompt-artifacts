The code prints a string containing a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Based on the initial state, if `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `mak2` is `n-1`. If `s` is '=', then `mak` is 0 and `mak2` is not defined, but since `n` is at least 4, `mak2` is not used in this case. Otherwise, the values of `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged, but since `s` is not '<' or '=', `mak` and `mak2` are not defined.

Since `i` is 1, it will be printed as 1.

Output: **? 0 (or undefined) (n-1 or undefined) 1 (n-1 or undefined)**
