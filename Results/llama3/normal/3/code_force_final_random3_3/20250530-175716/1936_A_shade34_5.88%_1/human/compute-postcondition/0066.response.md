The code prints a string containing four values from the `pans` list. The first two values are the same and are located at index `mak2` in the `pans` list, where `mak2` is equal to `n-1`. The last two values are the same and are located at index `i` in the `pans` list, where `i` is equal to 3.
Output: **?, [pans[n-1]], [pans[n-1]], [pans[3]], [pans[3]] (where pans[n-1] is the (n-1)th element of the pans list and pans[3] is the 4th element of the pans list)**
