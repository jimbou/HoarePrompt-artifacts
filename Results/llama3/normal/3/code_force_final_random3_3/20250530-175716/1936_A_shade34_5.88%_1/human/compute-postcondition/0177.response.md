Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values. They might be variables, functions, or objects, but without more information, we can't say what they represent.
* `i` is defined as 0 in the initial state.

Considering the print statement, it will print the following:

* The string '?' (a literal question mark)
* The value of `mak` (unknown)
* The value of `mak2` (unknown)
* The value of `i`, which is 0
* The value of `mak2` again (unknown)

Since we don't know the values of `mak` and `mak2`, we can't provide a precise numerical output. However, we can describe the output as:

Output: **?, [unknown], [unknown], 0, [unknown]**

Note that the `[unknown]` placeholders represent the unknown values of `mak` and `mak2`.
