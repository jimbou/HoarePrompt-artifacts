The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, and then initializes `mak` to 0. Since stdin initially contains one input, an integer, which is the number of test cases and must be at least 1, after the first line, stdin will be empty. The second line does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, mak is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
