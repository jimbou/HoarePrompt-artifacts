Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a string containing a single character read from stdin, stdin is empty, `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', `mak` is 0 if `s` is '=', `mak` is 1 if `s` is neither '<' nor '=' and `mak` was '<' before, `mak` is 0 if `s` is neither '<' nor '=' and `mak` was not '<' before, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is [1, 2] if `s` is '<', `pans` is [0, 2] if `s` is '=' and `mak` is 0, `pans` is [0, 1, 2] if `s` is '=' and `mak` is 1, `pans` is unchanged and appended with 2 if `s` is neither '<' nor '=', the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2` which is 0, the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `mak2` which is 0 have been printed and flushed to the console.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `s` is still a string containing a single character read from stdin, and stdin is still empty. The value of `mak` depends on the value of `s`, and `mak2` is still 0. The list `pans` has been appended with the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` have been printed and flushed to the console.
