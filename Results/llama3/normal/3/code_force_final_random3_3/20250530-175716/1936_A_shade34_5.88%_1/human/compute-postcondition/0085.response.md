The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak` repeated twice, and the value of `i` repeated twice.
Since `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '<', and retains its original value otherwise, and `i` is 2, the output will be a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak` (which is either 1 or its original value), and the value of `i` (which is 2).
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the user's input is '<', and its original value otherwise)**
