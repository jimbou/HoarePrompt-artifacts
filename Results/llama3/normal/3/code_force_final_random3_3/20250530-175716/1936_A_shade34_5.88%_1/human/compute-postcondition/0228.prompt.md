Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). Each test case contains one input: an integer (the size of the permutation).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is the index of the maximum value in the list `pans`, `mak2` is `n-1`, and `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1`. The output is flushed to the screen, showing '?' followed by the value of `pans[mak]` twice, and the value of `pans[i]` twice, for all values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and this is printed: '!', the second last element of the list `pans` which is `n-2`, and the index of the maximum value in the list `pans` which is `mak`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is the index of the maximum element in the list `pans`, and `mak2` is `n-1`, and '!' followed by the value of `mak2` which is `n-1` and the value of `mak` which is `n-1` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `len(pans)`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the user's input is '<' or '=', `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '>', `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '<', the output buffer is empty, and the printed output is "!"+str(n-1)+str(n-1)+'?' + str(pans[0]) + str(pans[0]) + str(i) + str(i), and this is printed: '?' + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[i]) + str(pans[i]), and the output buffer is flushed, and `pans` must have at least `len(pans)` elements, and this is printed: '?' + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[i]) + str(pans[i]), and the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: '!' followed by the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '<' (mak2) and the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '>' (mak), and the output buffer is flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
