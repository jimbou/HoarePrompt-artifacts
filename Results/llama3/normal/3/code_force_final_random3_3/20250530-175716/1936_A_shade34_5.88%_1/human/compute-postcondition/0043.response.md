The code prints a string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Since `mak2` is 0, the output will contain two occurrences of 0.

The value of `i` is 2.

The value of `mak` depends on the value of `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1. If `s` is '=', then `mak` is either 0 or 1, depending on its previous value. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', then `mak` is either 0 or 1, depending on its previous value.

Output: **? 0 0 2 0 (if s is '=' or not '<' or '=' and mak was 0 before), ? 1 0 2 0 (if s is '<' or s is '=' and mak was 1 before, or s is not '<' or '=' and mak was 1 before)**
