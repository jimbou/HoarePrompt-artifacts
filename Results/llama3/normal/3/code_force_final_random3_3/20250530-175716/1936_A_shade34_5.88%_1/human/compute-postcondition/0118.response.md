Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `mak`: The value of `mak` depends on the value of the string `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1. If `s` is '=', then `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged, which means it is 0.
* `mak2`: The value of `mak2` also depends on the value of the string `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak2` is `n-1`. If `s` is '=', then `mak2` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak2` remains unchanged, which means it is `n-1`.
* `i`: The value of `i` is given as 2.
* `mak2` (second occurrence): This is the same as the first occurrence of `mak2`, which is `n-1`.

Now, let's consider the possible values of `s`:

* If `s` is '<', then the print statement will output: `?, 1, n-1, 2, n-1`
* If `s` is '=', then the print statement will output: `?, 0, n-1, 2, n-1`
* Otherwise, the print statement will output: `?, 0, n-1, 2, n-1`

Since we don't know the exact value of `s`, we can't determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output as:

Output: **?, [mak], [mak2], 2, [mak2] (where [mak] is 0 or 1 depending on the value of s, and [mak2] is n-1)**
