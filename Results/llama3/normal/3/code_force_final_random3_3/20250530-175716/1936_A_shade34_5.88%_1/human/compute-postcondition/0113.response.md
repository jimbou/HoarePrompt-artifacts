Output State: **n is at least 4, i is 1, s is a string containing the user's input, pans is [1], mak is 1, mak2 is n-1, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, making `mak` equal to 1. The second line assigns a new list containing only the value of `i` to `pans`, making `pans` equal to [1]. No other variables are affected. The values of `n`, `s`, `mak2`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
