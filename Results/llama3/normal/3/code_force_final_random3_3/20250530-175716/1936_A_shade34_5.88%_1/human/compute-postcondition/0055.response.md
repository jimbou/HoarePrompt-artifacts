Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values from 0 to `n-1`, and the output is flushed to the screen, showing ? followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]) twice, and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]) twice.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output is flushed to the screen, displaying the specified string. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the output is simply displayed on the screen.
