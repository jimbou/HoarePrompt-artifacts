The code prints a string that includes several elements from the `pans` list and the current value of `i`. 

The `pans` list contains all the values of `i` for which the user's input is '<' or '='. The `mak` variable is 0, which means it will be used to access the first element of the `pans` list. The `i` variable is 1.

The print statement will output a string in the format '?', followed by the first element of the `pans` list (accessed by `pans[mak]`), the first element of the `pans` list again, the current value of `i` (which is 1), and the current value of `i` again.

Output: **? [first element of pans], [first element of pans], 1, 1**
