The code prints a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `pans[mak]` twice, and the value of `pans[i]` twice.

Since `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '>' and 0 otherwise, and `i` is 2, the print statement will output the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1) twice, and the third element of the list `pans` (at index 2) twice.

Output: **? [pans[1]] [pans[1]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where pans[1] is the second element of the list pans and pans[2] is the third element of the list pans)**
