The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing the input value, mak2 has been printed and flushed to the console. If s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is [1] or mak is 0 and pans is [0, 1]. If s is '=', then pans contains the value 1 or pans contains the value 0 and 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', the state of the program remains unchanged, and this is printed: '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2.**
