Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to at least 2, `s` is a string containing the user's input. If the user's input is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is at least 1. Otherwise, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` retains its original value. The output ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [mak] [mak] 2 2 is flushed to the console and the buffer is cleared, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is 2 and [i] is 3, and the buffer is cleared.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `pans`, `s`, `mak`, and `mak2` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the output is flushed to the console, the buffer is cleared, and a new output is printed. The new output is a string that includes the values of `mak` and `i`, which are 2 and 3, respectively.
