Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values from 0 to `n-1`, the output is flushed to the screen, and the printed output remains the same: ? followed by the 3rd element of the list `pans` which is `pans[mak]` and the 3rd element of the list `pans` which is `pans[mak]` and the 4th element of the list `pans` which is `pans[i]` and the 4th element of the list `pans` which is `pans[i]`. If the user input is '>', then `mak` is set to 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
