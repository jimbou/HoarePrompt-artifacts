Based on the precondition, let's break down the values of the variables and objects that will be printed:

* `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0 if the user's input is not '>', and the user's input is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we know that `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order. Therefore, `pans[mak]` will be the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list.
* `pans[mak]` (second occurrence): Same as above, since `mak` is the same value.
* `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 3, `pans[i]` will be the element at index 3 in the `pans` list.
* `pans[i]` (second occurrence): Same as above, since `i` is the same value.

Now, let's put it all together:

Output: **? followed by the element at index mak in the pans list, the element at index mak in the pans list, the element at index 3 in the pans list, and the element at index 3 in the pans list**

Note that we can't determine the exact numerical values of the elements in the `pans` list, since the value of `n` is not specified. However, we can describe the output in terms of the indices and the structure of the `pans` list.
