Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

- '?' is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- The value of `mak` depends on the value of `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is either 1 or 0. If `s` is '=', then `mak` is not explicitly defined, but based on the condition for `pans`, it can be inferred that `mak` could be either 1 or 0. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', the state of the program remains unchanged, but since `mak` is printed, we can assume it has a value, which is not specified. However, since `mak2` has been printed and flushed to the console, it implies that `mak` has been determined before this point, so it will have a value of either 1 or 0.
- `mak2` has been printed and flushed to the console, which means its value has been determined before this point. However, its exact value is not specified in the initial state. Since `mak2` is related to `mak` and `s`, we can infer that `mak2` is likely to be either 1 or 0, but without more information, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 2.

Given these considerations, the print statement will output a string that includes the literal '?', the value of `mak` (which could be 1 or 0 depending on `s`), the value of `mak2` (which is not specified but likely 1 or 0), the value of `i` which is 2, and again the value of `mak2`.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 2 [mak2] (where [mak] is either 1 or 0 depending on s, and [mak2] is the value of mak2 which is likely 1 or 0 but not specified)**
