Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `_` is 0, the output ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] is displayed on the screen where [mak] is `n-1` and [i] is `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is one less than the initial value of `n`. The value of `mak` is also one less than the initial value of `n`. The output buffer has been flushed, and the last output displayed on the screen is in the format ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where [mak] and [i] are both equal to `n-1`.
