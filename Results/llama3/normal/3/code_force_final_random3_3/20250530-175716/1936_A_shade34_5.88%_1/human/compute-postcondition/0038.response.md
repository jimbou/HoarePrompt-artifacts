Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, s is '<' if the user input is '<', s is '=' if the user input is '=', s is unchanged if the user input is neither '<' nor '=', mak is 1, pans is [1], and mak2 has been printed and flushed to the console. The following is printed: '?' , the value of mak which is 1, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2 which is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 1. The value of `s` depends on the user's input. If the user input is '<', then `s` is '<'. If the user input is '=', then `s` is '='. If the user input is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the program remains unchanged, and `s` retains its original value. The value of `mak` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The list `pans` is updated to contain the value 1, which is the current value of `i`. The value of `mak2` has been printed and flushed to the console, but its value remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The following values are printed: '?' , the value of `mak` which is 1, the value of `mak2` which is 0, the value of `i` which is 1, and the value of `mak2` which is 0.
