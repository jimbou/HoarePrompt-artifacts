To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, such as `mak`, `_`, and the output buffer, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is displayed on the screen. If the current input is '<', then `mak` is 2, `_` is 0, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is 2 and [i] is 2, and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mak` and `_`**
