Based on the precondition, the variables `mak`, `i`, and `pans` have the following values:

*   `mak` is 0
*   `i` is 1
*   `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to at least 1

When the print statement `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)` is executed, it will print the string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.

Since `mak` is 0 and `i` is 1, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
