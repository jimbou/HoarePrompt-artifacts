Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 0 if the user's input is not '>', otherwise `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is `n-1`, and the output is flushed to the console, and the output is '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` which is 0, the first element of the list `pans` which is 0, the second element of the list `pans` which is 1, and the second element of the list `pans` which is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 0 if the user's input is not '>', otherwise `mak` is 2, `mak2` is `n-1`, and the output is flushed to the console, and the output is '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` which is 0, the first element of the list `pans` which is 0, the second element of the list `pans` which is 1, and the second element of the list `pans` which is 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` which is 0, the first element of the list `pans` which is 0, the second element of the list `pans` which is 1, and the second element of the list `pans` which is 1, and the output is flushed to the console.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order and must have at least 4 elements, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 3 if the user's input is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, and the output is flushed to the console, and the output is '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` which is 0, the first element of the list `pans` which is 0, the second element of the list `pans` which is 1, and the second element of the list `pans` which is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
