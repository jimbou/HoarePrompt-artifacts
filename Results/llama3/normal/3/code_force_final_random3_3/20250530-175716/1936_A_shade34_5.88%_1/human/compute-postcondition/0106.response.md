The code `pans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `pans`. Since `i` is 0, the list `pans` now contains the value 0. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `pans` is a list containing the value 0, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, and `s` is '='.**
