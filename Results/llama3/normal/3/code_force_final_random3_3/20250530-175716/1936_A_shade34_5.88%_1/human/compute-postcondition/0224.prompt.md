Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than or equal to 1, i is n, pans is a list containing all the values of i for which the user's input is '<' or '=', mak is 0, mak2 is the last value of i for which the user's input is '<', and the output buffer contains the string "!"+str(n-1)+str(n-1)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the user's input is '<' or '=', `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '>', otherwise it remains 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '<', the output buffer is empty, and the printed output is "!"+str(n-1)+str(n-1)+'?' + str(pans[0]) + str(pans[0]) + str(i) + str(i).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the user's input is '<' or '=', `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '>', otherwise it is 2, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '<', the output buffer is empty, and the printed output is "!"+str(n-1)+str(n-1)+'?' + str(pans[0]) + str(pans[0]) + str(i) + str(i), and this is printed: '?' + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[i]) + str(pans[i]), and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the user's input is '<' or '=', `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '>', otherwise it is 2, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '<', the output buffer is empty, and the printed output is "!"+str(n-1)+str(n-1)+'?' + str(pans[0]) + str(pans[0]) + str(i) + str(i), and this is printed: '?' + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[i]) + str(pans[i]), and the output buffer is flushed, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements, and this is printed: '?' + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[mak]) + str(pans[i]) + str(pans[i]), and the output buffer is flushed. If the user's input is '>', then `mak` is 3, and the output is updated accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
