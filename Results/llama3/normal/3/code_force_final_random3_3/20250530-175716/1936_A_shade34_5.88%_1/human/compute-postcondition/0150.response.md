The code prints an exclamation mark, the value of `mak2`, and the value of `mak`. 
`mak2` is `n-1` and `mak` is the index of the maximum element in the list `pans`. Since `pans` contains all the indices from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, the maximum element in `pans` is `n-1`. Therefore, `mak` is `n-1`. 
Since `n` is at least 4, `n-1` is at least 3.
Output: **! 3 3**
