Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is at least 1, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to at least 1, and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is flushed to the console.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables, but it ensures that the output ? 0 0 1 1 is immediately printed to the console, rather than being buffered. The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.
