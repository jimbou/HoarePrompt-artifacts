Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a string containing the user's input, stdin is empty. If `s` is '<', then `pans` is [1, 2], `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is `n-1`. If `s` is '=', then `pans` is [0, 1, 2], `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `pans` is [0, 2], `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `pans` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `s` being '<', '=', or otherwise still apply, and the corresponding values of `pans`, `mak`, and `mak2` are updated accordingly.
