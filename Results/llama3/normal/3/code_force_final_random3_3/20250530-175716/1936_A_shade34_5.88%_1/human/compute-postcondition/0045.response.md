Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing a single character read from stdin, stdin is empty, mak is 1 if s is '<', mak is 0 if s is '=', mak is 1 if s is neither '<' nor '=' and mak was '<' before, mak is 0 if s is neither '<' nor '=' and mak was not '<' before, mak2 is 0, pans is [1] if s is '<', pans is [0] if s is '=' and mak is 0, pans is [0, 1] if s is '=' and mak is 1, pans is unchanged if s is neither '<' nor '=', '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2 which is 0 have been printed and flushed to the console.**

The first line flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is immediately printed to the console. The second line reads a single character from stdin and assigns it to the variable s. The value of s is a string containing a single character. The state of the program remains unchanged if s is neither '<' nor '='. If s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is [1]. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0 if mak is 0, or a list containing the values 0 and 1 if mak is 1. The values of n, i, and mak2 remain unchanged.
