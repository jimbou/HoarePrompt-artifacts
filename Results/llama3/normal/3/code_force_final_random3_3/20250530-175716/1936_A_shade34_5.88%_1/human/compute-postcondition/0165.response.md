Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n-1 in ascending order, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is n-1, and the output buffer is empty, and the string "? 1 1 2 2" has been printed to the console.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, which means that any buffered output has been written to the console. In this case, the string "? 1 1 2 2" has been printed to the console. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
