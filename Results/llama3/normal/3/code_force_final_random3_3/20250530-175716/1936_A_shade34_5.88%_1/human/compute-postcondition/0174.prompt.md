Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to its original value, i is n, pans is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n-1 in ascending order, s is a string containing the user's input, mak is 0, mak2 is n-1, and the output buffer contains the string "!"+str(n-1)+str(n-1)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n-1 in ascending order, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is n-1, and the output buffer is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n-1 in ascending order, `s` is a string containing the user's input, the output buffer is empty, and the string "? 1 1 2 2" has been printed to the console. If the user's input is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is n-1. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is n-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n-1 in ascending order, `s` is a string containing the user's input, the output buffer is empty, and the string "? 1 1 2 2" has been printed to the console. If the user's input is '<', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is n-1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is 3) twice, followed by the value of `i` (which is 3) twice, and the output buffer has been flushed. Otherwise, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is n-1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (either 2 or 3) twice, followed by the value of `i` (which is 3) twice, and the output buffer has been flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
