Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is displayed on the screen, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current input is '<', then `mak` is 2, `_` is 0, and the output ? 2 2 3 3 is displayed on the screen, and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mak` and `_`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The output buffer is flushed, which means that any pending output is displayed on the screen. If the current input is '<', then `mak` is assigned the value 2, and `_` is assigned the value 0. The output ? 2 2 3 3 is displayed on the screen, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current input is not '<', then `mak` and `_` are not changed.
