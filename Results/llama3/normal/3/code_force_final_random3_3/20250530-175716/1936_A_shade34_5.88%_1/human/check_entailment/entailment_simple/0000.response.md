Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices i and j in a secret permutation p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a query-based approach to achieve this.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first finds the index `mak` of the maximum value in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum.
2.  It then finds all indices `pans` that have the same maximum value as `mak` by comparing each element with `mak`.
3.  Finally, it finds the index `mak` that has the maximum XOR value with `mak2` (the initial maximum index) by comparing each element in `pans` with `mak2`.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses at most 3n queries as required by the problem statement. The use of `sys.stdout.flush()` after each print statement ensures that the output is flushed immediately, which is necessary for interactive problems.

Correctness: **True**
