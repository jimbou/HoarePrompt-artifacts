Output: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n-1 in ascending order, `s` is a string containing the user's input, the output buffer is empty, and the string "? 1 1 2 2" has been printed to the console. If the user's input is '<', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is n-1. Otherwise, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is n-1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (either 2 or 3) twice, followed by the value of `i` (which is 3) twice**
