Postcondition: ***n is at least 4, i is 1, s is a string containing the user's input, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then pans is [1], mak is 1, and mak2 is n-1. If s is '=', then pans is [0, 1], mak is 0, and mak2 is n-1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with pans being [0], mak being 0, and mak2 being n-1.***
