Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, and the output ? 0 0 1 1 is displayed on the screen.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` forces the output buffer to be flushed, which means that any output that was buffered is immediately displayed on the screen. In this case, the output ? 0 0 1 1 was already printed, but it may not have been displayed on the screen yet due to buffering. After the flush, it is guaranteed to be displayed. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` are not affected by this code, so they remain the same.
