Based on the precondition, the print statement will print an exclamation mark '!', followed by the value of `mak2` (the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '<'), and then the value of `mak` (the last value of `i` for which the user's input is '>').

Since the exact values of `mak2` and `mak` are not provided, we can't compute their exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `mak2` and `mak` as described above.

Output: **! [mak2] [mak] (where mak2 is the last value of i for which the user's input is '<' and mak is the last value of i for which the user's input is '>')**
