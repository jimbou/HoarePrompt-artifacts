To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 4. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `s`, `stdin`, `pans`, `mak`, and `mak2`, are not part of the loop head and their states do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `stdin` is empty. If `s` is '<', then `pans` is [1], `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is `n-1`. If `s` is '=', then `pans` is [0, 1], `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is `n-1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `pans` being [0], `mak` being 0, and `mak2` being `n-1**
