The code prints a string that includes the character '?' and the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`. 

`pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the user's input is '<' or '='. Since `i` is 3, `pans[i]` refers to the 4th element in the `pans` list (because list indices start at 0). 

`mak` is 1 if the user's input is '>', otherwise it is 2. Since the value of `mak` is not explicitly given, we can't determine its exact value. However, we know that `mak` is either 1 or 2. 

Therefore, `pans[mak]` refers to either the 2nd element (if `mak` is 1) or the 3rd element (if `mak` is 2) of the `pans` list.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[mak] is either the 2nd or 3rd element of the pans list, and pans[i] is the 4th element of the pans list)**
