Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, i is 2, s is a string containing the user's input, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then pans is [1, 2] and mak is 1, and mak2 is n-1. If s is '=', then pans is [0, 1, 2] and mak is 0, and mak2 is n-1. If s is '>', then pans is [0, 2] and mak is 0, and mak2 is n-1. If s is '<' and the condition is true, then pans is [2] and mak is 2.***
