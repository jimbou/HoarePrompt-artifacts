Output: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `stdin` is empty. If `s` is '<', then `pans` is [1], `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is `n-1`. If `s` is '=', then `pans` is [0, 1], `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is `n-1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `pans` being [0], `mak` being 0, and `mak2` being `n-1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or 1), followed by the value of `mak2` (which is `n-1`), followed by the value of `i` (which is 2), and followed by the value of `mak2` (which is `n-1`) again.**
