Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than or equal to 1, i is n, pans is an empty list, s is a string containing the user's input, mak is n-1 if the user's input is '<' for all iterations, otherwise mak is the last value of i for which the user's input is '<', mak2 is the same as mak, and the output buffer contains the string "!"+str(n-1)+str(n-1)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, s is a string containing the input value, '?' , mak, mak2, 0, mak2 has been printed and flushed to the console. If s is '<', then mak is 0 and pans is [0]. If s is '=', then pans contains the value 0. If s is neither '<' nor '=', the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, i is 1, s is a string containing the input value, mak2 has been printed and flushed to the console. If s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is [1] or mak is 0 and pans is [0, 1]. If s is '=', then pans contains the value 1 or pans contains the value 0 and 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', the state of the program remains unchanged, and this is printed: '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 1, and the value of mak2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing the input value, mak2 has been printed and flushed to the console. If s is '<', then mak is 2 and pans is [2]. If s is '=', then pans contains the value 1 or pans contains the value 0 and 1 and 2. If s is neither '<' nor '=', the state of the program remains unchanged, and this is printed: '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2. Otherwise, if s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is [1, 2] or mak is 0 and pans is [0, 1, 2].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
