Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, which means `n` is a non-negative integer.
* `i` is 1.
* `s` is a string containing the user's input, but it's not used in the print statement.
* `mak` is 0.
* `mak2` is `n-1`, but it's not used in the print statement.
* `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values from 0 to `n-1`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`

* `pans[mak]` is equivalent to `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list.
* `pans[i]` is equivalent to `pans[1]`, which is the second element of the `pans` list.

Since `pans` contains values from 0 to `n-1`, we can conclude that:

* `pans[0]` is a value between 0 and `n-1`.
* `pans[1]` is a value between 0 and `n-1`.

The print statement will output a string with the following format:

`? <value1> <value1> <value2> <value2>`

where `<value1>` is the first element of the `pans` list, and `<value2>` is the second element of the `pans` list.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where pans[0] and pans[1] are values between 0 and n-1)**
