The code prints an exclamation mark '!', followed by the value of `mak2` which is `n-1`, and the value of `mak` which is the index of the maximum value in the list `pans`. Since `pans` contains all values from 0 to `n-1`, the maximum value is `n-1` and its index is also `n-1`. Therefore, `mak` is also `n-1`.

Output: **!(exclamation mark), n-1 (which is the value of mak2), n-1 (which is the value of mak)**
