If s is '<', then s is '<', mak is 1, and pans is [1]. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0 if mak is 0, or a list containing the values 0 and 1 if mak is 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state of the program remains unchanged, with mak being 1 if s was '<' before, and mak being 0 otherwise. and this is printed: '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2 which is 0**
