Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects as follows:

* `n` is greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified.
* `i` is 2.
* `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n-1 in ascending order. Since `n` is greater than 2, `pans` will contain at least the indices 0, 1, and 2.
* `s` is a string containing the user's input, but its exact value is not specified.
* `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '<', otherwise it is 0. Since the exact value of `s` is not specified, we cannot determine the value of `mak`.
* `mak2` is n-1. Since `n` is greater than 2, `mak2` will be at least 1.
* The output buffer is empty.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`

The print statement will print the following values:

* '?' (a literal string)
* `mak` (which is either 1 or 0, depending on the user's input)
* `mak` again (which is the same value as the previous one)
* `i` (which is 2)
* `i` again (which is 2)

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `mak`, we can describe the output as:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is either 1 or 0, depending on the user's input)**
