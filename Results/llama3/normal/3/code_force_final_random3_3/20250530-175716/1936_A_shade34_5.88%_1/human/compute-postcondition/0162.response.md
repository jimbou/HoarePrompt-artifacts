The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n-1 in ascending order, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is n-1, and the output buffer is empty.**
