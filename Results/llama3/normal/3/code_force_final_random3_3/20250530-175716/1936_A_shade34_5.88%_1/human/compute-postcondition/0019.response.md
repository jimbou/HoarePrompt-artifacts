Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is displayed on the screen, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current input is '<', then `_` is 0, and the output ? 2 2 3 3 is displayed on the screen, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The output state still depends on the current input, and if it is '<', then `_` is 0 and the specific output is displayed on the screen.
