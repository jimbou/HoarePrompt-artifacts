Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to at least 2, `s` is a string containing the user's input. If the user's input is '<', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is at least 1. Otherwise, `mak` is 2 and `mak2` retains its original value. The output ? 0 0 1 1 and ? [mak] [mak] 2 2 is flushed to the console and the buffer is cleared, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is either 2 or 3 and [i] is 3, and the buffer is cleared.***
