To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, such as `mak` and `_`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is displayed on the screen. If the current input is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` is 0 and `_` is 0.**
