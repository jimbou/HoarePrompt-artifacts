Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, mak is n-1, _ is 0, mak2 is n-1, pans is an empty list, the output ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] is displayed on the screen where [mak] is n-1 and [i] is n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`, effectively copying the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` becomes `n-1` as well. The second line initializes an empty list `pans`. 

The initial state's information about `n`, `i`, `_`, the displayed output, and the flushed output buffer remains unchanged as the code does not modify these. The introduction of `mak2` with the value of `n-1` and the creation of an empty list `pans` are the only changes to the state.
