The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak` repeated twice, and the value of `i` repeated twice.

Since `mak` is either 2 or 3 depending on the user's input, and `i` is 3, the output will be either "? 2 2 3 3" or "? 3 3 3 3".

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where mak is either 2 or 3 depending on the user's input)**
