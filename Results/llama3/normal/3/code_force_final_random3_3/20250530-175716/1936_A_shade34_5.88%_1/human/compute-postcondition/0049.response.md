Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing a single character read from stdin, stdin is empty, if s is '<', then mak is 2, mak2 is 0, and pans is [2]. If s is not '<', then mak is 1 if s is '<' or if s is neither '<' nor '=' and mak was '<' before, mak is 0 if s is '=' or if s is neither '<' nor '=' and mak was not '<' before, mak2 is 0, and pans is [1, 2] if s is '<', [0, 2] if s is '=' and mak is 0, [0, 1, 2] if s is '=' and mak is 1, or unchanged and appended with 2 if s is neither '<' nor '='. The value of mak, the value of mak2 which is 0, the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2 which is 0 have been printed and flushed to the console.***
