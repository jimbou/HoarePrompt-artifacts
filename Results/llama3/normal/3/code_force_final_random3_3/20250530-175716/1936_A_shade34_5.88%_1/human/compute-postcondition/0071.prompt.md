Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, and `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1`. The output ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] has been printed and flushed to the console for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak` is 1 if the user's input is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values from 0 to `n-1`, and the output is flushed to the screen, showing ? followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]) twice, and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]) twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values from 0 to `n-1`, and the output is flushed to the screen, showing ? followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]) twice, and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]) twice. If the user's input is '>', then `mak` is 2 and the output is flushed to the screen, showing '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[2]) twice, and the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]) twice. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and the output is flushed to the screen, showing '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[1]) twice, and the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]) twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values from 0 to `n-1`, the output is flushed to the screen, and the printed output remains the same: ? followed by the 3rd element of the list `pans` which is `pans[mak]` and the 3rd element of the list `pans` which is `pans[mak]` and the 4th element of the list `pans` which is `pans[i]` and the 4th element of the list `pans` which is `pans[i]`. If the user input is '>', then `mak` is set to 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
