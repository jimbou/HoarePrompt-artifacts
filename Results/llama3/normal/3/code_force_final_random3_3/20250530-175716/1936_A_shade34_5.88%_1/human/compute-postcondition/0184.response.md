Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string containing the input value, '?' , `mak`, `mak2`, 0, `mak2` has been printed and flushed to the console, `pans` contains the value 0, and the current value of `s` is '='**

In this output state, the value of `i` is appended to the list `pans`. Since `i` is 0, `pans` now contains the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `s`, `mak`, `mak2`, and the console output are still valid.
