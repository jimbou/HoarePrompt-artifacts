Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables as follows:

* `n` is at least 4, but its exact value is not specified.
* `i` is 0.
* `pans` is an empty list, but it is not used in the print statement.
* `s` is a string containing the user's input, but it is not used in the print statement.
* `mak` is `n-1`, which means it is at least 3 (since `n` is at least 4).
* `mak2` is also `n-1`, which means it is also at least 3.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`

The print statement will output a string that starts with a question mark `?`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are both `n-1`, they will have the same value, which is at least 3. `i` is 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 3 3 0 3**

Note that the exact value of `n` is not specified, so we can't determine the exact value of `mak` and `mak2`. However, we can describe their value as "at least 3" based on the precondition.
