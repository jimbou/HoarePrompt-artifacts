Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`.

* `mak` is 0, so it will be printed as 0.
* `i` is 1, so it will be printed as 1.

Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with '?' followed by the values of `mak` and `i`, which are 0 and 1, respectively, repeated twice.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
