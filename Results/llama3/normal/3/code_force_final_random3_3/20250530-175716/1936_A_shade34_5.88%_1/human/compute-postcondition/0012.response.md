Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, the output ? 0 0 1 1 is displayed on the screen, if the current input is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` is 0 and `_` is 0, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is either 0 or 1 and [i] is 2, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any buffered output is immediately displayed on the screen. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` remain the same, and the output on the screen is still ? 0 0 1 1.
