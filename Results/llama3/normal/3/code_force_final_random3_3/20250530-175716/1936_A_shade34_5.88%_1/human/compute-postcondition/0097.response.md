Output State: **n is at least 4, i is n-1, pans is an empty list, s is a string containing the user's input, mak is n-1, mak2 is n-1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `mak2` and `pans`. The first line assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`, making `mak2` equal to `n-1`. The second line assigns an empty list to `pans`, effectively clearing its contents. The other variables, `n`, `i`, `s`, and `mak`, retain their original values.
