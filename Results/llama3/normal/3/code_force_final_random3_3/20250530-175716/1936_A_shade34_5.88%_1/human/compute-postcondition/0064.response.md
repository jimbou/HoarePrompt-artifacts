Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `s` is a string containing the user's input, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values from 0 to `n-1`, and the output is flushed to the screen, showing ? followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]) twice, and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]) twice. If the user's input is '>', then `mak` is 2 and the output is flushed to the screen, showing '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[2]) twice, and the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]) twice. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and the output is flushed to the screen, showing '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] (which is pans[1]) twice, and the value of pans[i] (which is pans[2]) twice.***
