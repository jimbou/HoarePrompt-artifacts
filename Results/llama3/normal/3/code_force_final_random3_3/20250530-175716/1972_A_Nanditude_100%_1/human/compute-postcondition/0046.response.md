Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `cnt` remains 0. The element at index `j` of list `b` is either less than the element at index `i` of list `a` or greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.***
