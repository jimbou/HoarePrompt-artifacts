Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1. In both cases, `b[j]` is either less than or greater than or equal to `a[i]`.***
