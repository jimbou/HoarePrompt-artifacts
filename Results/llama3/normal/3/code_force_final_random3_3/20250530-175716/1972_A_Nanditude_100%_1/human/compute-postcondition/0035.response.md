Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the first input list, `b` is a list of integers equal to the second input list. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is either 2 or 3.***
