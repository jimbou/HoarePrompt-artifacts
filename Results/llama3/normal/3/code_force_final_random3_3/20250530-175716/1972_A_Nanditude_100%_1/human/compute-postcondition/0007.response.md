Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]` is still valid, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer.
