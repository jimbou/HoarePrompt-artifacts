Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `i` is either 1, 2 or 3, `j` is 2, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]` but less than `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 0. The element at index `j` of list `b` is either less than the element at index `i` of list `a` or greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that determine the value of `cnt` based on the values of `b[j]` and `a[i]` are still valid. The stdin still contains three inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, and a space-separated list of integers.
