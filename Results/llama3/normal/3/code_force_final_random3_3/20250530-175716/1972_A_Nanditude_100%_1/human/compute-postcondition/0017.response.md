Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains an integer, `a` and `b` remain lists of integers, and `cnt` becomes an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive), depending on how many times the condition `b[j] < a[i]` was true during the loop's execution. The value of `i` will be between 0 and `n`, depending on how many times the condition `b[j] >= a[i]` was true, causing `i` to increment. The value of `j` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes, as it increments from 0 to `n-1` during the loop's execution. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer.
