Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1. In both cases, `b[j]` is either less than or greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `cnt` and `i` is still dependent on the comparison between `b[j]` and `a[i-1]`, where `i-1` is used because `i` has been incremented.
