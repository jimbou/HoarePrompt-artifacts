Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. The value of `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in list `a`. The value of `i` is equal to the number of elements in list `a` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in list `b`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged, still greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`.
* The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, indicating the number of iterations the loop has executed.
* The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, still containing integers.
* The value of `cnt` will be an integer between 0 and `n`, representing the number of elements in list `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in list `a`.
* The value of `i` will be an integer between 0 and `n`, representing the number of elements in list `a` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in list `b`.
* The value of `j` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` iterations.
* The stdin remains unchanged, still containing 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, and a space-separated list of integers.
