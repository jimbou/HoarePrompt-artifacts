The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2. If the current value of `b[j]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 1. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1. In all cases, `b[j]` is either less than or greater than or equal to `a[i]` or `a[i-1]`.**
