To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `n-1`, which means `n` must be greater than 0 for `j` to be a valid index. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers**
