Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then two lists a and b of length n, each containing non-negative integers in non-decreasing order.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer, and the value of `cnt` which is an integer between 0 and `n` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and decreased by n, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a list of integers equal to the first input list, b is a list of integers equal to the second input list, cnt is the number of elements in b that are less than the corresponding elements in a, i is n, j is n-1, stdin is empty, and the number of elements in b that are less than the corresponding elements in a which is cnt is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. The value of `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in list `a`. The value of `i` is equal to the number of elements in list `a` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in list `b`, and the value of cnt is printed which is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
