The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `cnt` remains 0. The element at index `j` of list `b` is either less than the element at index `i` of list `a` or greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.**
