Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and equal to t - n, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, cnt is 0, i is 0, j is n-1, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if b[j] < a[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `cnt` remains 0. The element at index `j` of list `b` is either less than the element at index `i` of list `a` or greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2, `i` is either 0, 1 or 2, `j` is 1, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]` but less than `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 0. The element at index `j` of list `b` is either less than the element at index `i` of list `a` or greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `i` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `j` is 2, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 3. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]` but less than `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 2. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 0. The element at index `j` of list `b` is either less than the element at index `i` of list `a` or greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
