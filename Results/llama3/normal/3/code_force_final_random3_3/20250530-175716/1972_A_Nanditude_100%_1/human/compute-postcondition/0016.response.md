Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 3. If the current value of `b[j]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 and `i` is 1. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 2. If the current value of `b[j]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1. In all cases, `b[j]` is either less than or greater than or equal to `a[i]` or `a[i-1]`.***
