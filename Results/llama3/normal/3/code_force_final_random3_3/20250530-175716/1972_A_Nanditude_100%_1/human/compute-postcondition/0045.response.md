Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. The element at index `j` of list `b` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the element at index `j` of list `b` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of list `a` is still valid, but now it refers to the element at index `i-1` of list `a` since `i` has been incremented.
