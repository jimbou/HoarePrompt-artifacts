Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer. The current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt` being equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state still hold true.
