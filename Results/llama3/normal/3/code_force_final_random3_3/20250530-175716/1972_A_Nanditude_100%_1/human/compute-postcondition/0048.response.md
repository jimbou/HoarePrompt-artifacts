Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `cnt` remains 1. The element at index `j` of list `b` is either less than the element at index `i` of list `a` or greater than or equal to the element at index `i-1` of list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `b[j]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` is still valid. The stdin still contains 3 inputs.
