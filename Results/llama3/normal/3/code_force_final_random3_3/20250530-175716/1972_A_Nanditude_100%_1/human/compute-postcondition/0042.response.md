Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**
