Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the first input list, `b` is a list of integers equal to the second input list, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
