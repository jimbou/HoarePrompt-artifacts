Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a list of integers equal to the first input list, b is a list of integers equal to the second input list, cnt is 0, i is 0, j is n-1, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains greater than 0 but has been decreased by 1. The value of `n` has been updated to the integer value input from stdin. The lists `a` and `b` now hold the integer values from the first and second input lists, respectively. The variable `cnt` has been reset to 0, and `i` has been initialized to 0. The value of `j` is now `n-1`, where `n` is the input integer value. Stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been consumed by the code.
