Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 1. In both cases, `b[j]` is either less than or greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was either 0 or 1 initially, it is now either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the relationship between `b[j]` and `a[i]` still holds, but now `cnt` is 2 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and 1 otherwise.
