To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0. Additionally, we can adjust the state of `j` to be 0, as it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer**
