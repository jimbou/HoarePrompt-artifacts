Output: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains 3 inputs: an integer, a space-separated list of integers, a space-separated list of integers. The value of `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in list `a`. The value of `i` is equal to the number of elements in list `a` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in list `b`, and the value of cnt is printed which is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in list `a`.**
