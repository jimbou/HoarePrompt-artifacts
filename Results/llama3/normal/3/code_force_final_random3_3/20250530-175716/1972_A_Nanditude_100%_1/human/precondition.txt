stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
