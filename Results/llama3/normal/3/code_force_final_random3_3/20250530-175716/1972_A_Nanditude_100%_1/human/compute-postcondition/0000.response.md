Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then two lists a and b of length n, each containing non-negative integers in non-decreasing order.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, since one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain three inputs each: an integer n and two lists a and b of length n, each containing non-negative integers in non-decreasing order.
