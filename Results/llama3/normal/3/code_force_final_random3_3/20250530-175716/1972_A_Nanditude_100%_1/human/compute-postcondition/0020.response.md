To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, which means it's not used anywhere in the loop body.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `t` is greater than 0
* `n` is an integer
* `a` is a list of integers
* `b` is a list of integers
* `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`
* `i` is an integer between 0 and `n`
* `j` is `n-1`
* stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer, and the value of `cnt` which is an integer between 0 and `n` is being printed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head. In this case, the only variable in the loop head is `t`.

Since the loop will execute `t` times, and `t` is greater than 0, we can conclude that `t` must be decreased by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `i` is an integer between 0 and `n`, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs: two lists of integers and an integer, and the value of `cnt` which is an integer between 0 and `n` is being printed**

Note that we didn't change the state of any other variables, as they are not part of the loop head.
