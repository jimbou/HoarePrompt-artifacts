According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and stdin must have at least 1 test case left. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case**
