Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the first input list, `b` is a list of integers equal to the second input list, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
