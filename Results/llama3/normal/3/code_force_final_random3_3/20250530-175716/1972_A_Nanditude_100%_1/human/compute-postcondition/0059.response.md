Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two lists a and b of length n. It then counts the number of elements in list b that are less than the corresponding elements in list a and prints this count. The function repeats this process for all test cases and finally empties the standard input.**
