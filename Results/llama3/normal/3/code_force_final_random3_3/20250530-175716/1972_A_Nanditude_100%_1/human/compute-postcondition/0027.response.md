Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 0, a is a list of integers equal to the first input list, b is a list of integers equal to the second input list, stdin is empty. If b[j] is less than a[i], cnt is 1, i is 0, and j is 0. Otherwise, cnt is 0, i is 1, and j is 0, and b[j] is greater than or equal to a[i-1].**
