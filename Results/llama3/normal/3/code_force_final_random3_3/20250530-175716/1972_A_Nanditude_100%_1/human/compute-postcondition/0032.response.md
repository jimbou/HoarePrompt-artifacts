To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(n):`. This means that the only objects in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

The other variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `cnt`, and `i` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers equal to the first input list, `b` is a list of integers equal to the second input list, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is 2**
