Output State: **`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, decreased by 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the first three integers from the input, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing three integers**

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `t` remains the same, but it is decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the first three integers from the input. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing three integers, because one line of input has been consumed to assign values to `n`, `a`, and `b`.
