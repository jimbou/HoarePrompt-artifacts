Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: t is an integer equal to 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin is empty. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer value of the expression (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1 is printed, where the sum is calculated as (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. It reads multiple lines of input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and each subsequent line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). The function then prints the product of n and a if b is less than or equal to a, or the sum of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1 if b is greater than a. The sum is calculated differently depending on whether b - a is greater than or equal to n. After processing all input lines, the function leaves stdin empty and the variables t, n, a, and b with values between 1 and 10^9.
