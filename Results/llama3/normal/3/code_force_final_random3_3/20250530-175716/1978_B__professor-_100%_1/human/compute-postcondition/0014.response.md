Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, the program prints either the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` (inclusive) multiplied by `n` otherwise.***
