To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to ensure that `t` is in a state that allows the loop to execute.

According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), t is greater than 0**
