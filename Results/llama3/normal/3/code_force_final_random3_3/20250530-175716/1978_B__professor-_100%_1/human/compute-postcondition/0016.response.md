Output State: **`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is decreased by 1 from its initial state. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing three integers, since one line of input has been read and processed.
