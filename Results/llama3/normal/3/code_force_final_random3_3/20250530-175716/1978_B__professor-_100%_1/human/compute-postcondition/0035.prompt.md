Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, the program prints either the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` (inclusive) multiplied by `n` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer value of the expression (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1 is printed, where the sum is calculated as (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, decreased by 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the first three integers from the input, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, starting from `b - n + 1`, is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the arithmetic series with `n` terms, starting from `a`, and with a common difference of 1, ending at `b`, is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
