The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer.
The value of `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
The expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `2 * b - n + 1` and the common difference is 1.
The `//` operator performs integer division, which means that the result of the expression will be an integer.
Output: **The sum of an arithmetic series with n terms, where the first term is 2b - n + 1 and the common difference is 1 (where b and n are integers between 1 and 10^9)**
