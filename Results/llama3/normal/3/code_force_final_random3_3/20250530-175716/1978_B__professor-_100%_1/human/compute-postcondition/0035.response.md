Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin is empty. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer value of the expression (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1 is printed, where the sum is calculated as (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` becomes 0, indicating that all input lines have been processed. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain within their specified ranges, but their exact values are determined by the last set of input values read from stdin. Stdin is empty because all input lines have been consumed by the loop. The output depends on the relationship between `a` and `b`: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output is the product of `n` and `a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the output is either the sum of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b - n + 1` if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, or the sum of an arithmetic sequence starting from `a` and ending at `b` otherwise.
