Output: **`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers, and this is printed: the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1, where the sum is calculated as (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n**
