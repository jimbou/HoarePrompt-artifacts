The code prints the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer.
Since `b` is greater than `a` and the current value of `b` minus `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, we can infer that `b` is at least `n + a`.
Therefore, the expression `(2 * b - n + 1)` is at least `2 * (n + a) - n + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2 * a + 1`.
Multiplying this by `n` and dividing by 2 gives us a value of at least `(n + 2 * a + 1) * n // 2`.
Output: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers. Additionally, `b` is greater than `a`. The current value of `b` minus `a` is greater than or equal to `n`. The value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed, which is at least `(n + 2 * a + 1) * n // 2`**
