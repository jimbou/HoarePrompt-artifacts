Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers. Additionally, `b` is greater than `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed, which is at least `(n + 2 * a + 1) * n // 2`. Otherwise, the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` (inclusive) multiplied by `n` is being printed.***
