The code reads a line of input from stdin and assigns the three integers to the variables n, a, and b. Since t is greater than 0, there are still t-1 lines of input left in stdin. The value of t is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing three integers**
