The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. The formula used is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series, which is given by `n * (a + b) / 2`. However, in this case, the formula is modified to `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which is equivalent to the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series with first term `a` and last term `b`.

The value of `a` is the first integer in each of the `t-3` lines of input, `b` is the second integer in each of the `t-3` lines of input, and `n` is the third integer in each of the `t-3` lines of input.

Output: **the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series with first term a and last term b (where a is the first integer in each of the t-3 lines of input, b is the second integer in each of the t-3 lines of input, and n is the third integer in each of the t-3 lines of input)**
