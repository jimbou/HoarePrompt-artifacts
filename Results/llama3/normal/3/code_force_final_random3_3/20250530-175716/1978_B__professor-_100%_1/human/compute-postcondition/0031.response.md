The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. The formula used is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series: `n * (a + b) / 2`, but since `b` is not necessarily the last term, the formula is adjusted to `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.

Here, `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the series (assuming `a` is the first term), and `a * n` adds the remaining terms up to `n`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers between 1 and 10^9, the result will be an integer.

Output: **the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic series with first term a and last term b**
