Output: **`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, decreased by 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the first three integers from the input, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing three integers, and the value of the expression (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 is being printed, where n is the number of terms in the sequence, b is the last term in the sequence, and the expression calculates the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, starting from b - n + 1**
