To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the value of `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
* `t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4
* `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)
* stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to decrease the value of `t` by 1, since the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

The new state is:
* `t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, decreased by 1 (i.e., `t-1`)
* `n`, `a`, and `b` remain the same, as they are not affected by the loop head
* stdin still contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers, but since `t` has decreased by 1, the number of remaining lines in stdin is now `t-4`

State: **`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, decreased by 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing three integers**
