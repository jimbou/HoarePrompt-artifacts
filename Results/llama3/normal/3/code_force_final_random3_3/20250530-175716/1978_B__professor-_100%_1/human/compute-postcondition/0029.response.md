The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), assigned from the input.
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), assigned from the input.
* The expression `2 * b - n + 1` is evaluated first. This is an integer expression, where `2 * b` is the product of 2 and the value of `b`, and then `n` is subtracted from it, and finally 1 is added.
* The result of the expression `2 * b - n + 1` is then multiplied by `n`.
* The `//` operator is used for integer division, which discards the fractional part and returns the integer part of the result.
* The final result is an integer, which is the product of `n` and the result of the expression `2 * b - n + 1`, divided by 2, and then rounded down to the nearest integer.

Output: **(2 * [b] - [n] + 1) * [n] // 2 (where b and n are the values of b and n, respectively)**
