Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer value of the expression (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1 is printed, where the sum is calculated as (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n.***
