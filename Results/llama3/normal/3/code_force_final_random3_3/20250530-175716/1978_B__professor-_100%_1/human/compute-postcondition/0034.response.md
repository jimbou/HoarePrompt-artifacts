Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between -1 and 10^4, decreased by 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the first three integers from the input, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing three integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is being printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, starting from `b - n + 1`, is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the arithmetic series with `n` terms, starting from `a`, and with a common difference of 1, ending at `b`, is being printed.***
