The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. The formula used is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`, plus the product of `a` and `n`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers, and `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, the expression will evaluate to an integer value.

However, without knowing the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Output: **the sum of an arithmetic series with n terms, where the first term is a and the last term is b (where a, b, and n are the values of the variables a, b, and n)**
