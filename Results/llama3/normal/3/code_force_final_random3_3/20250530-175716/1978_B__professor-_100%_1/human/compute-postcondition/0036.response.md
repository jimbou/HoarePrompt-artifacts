Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. It reads multiple lines of input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and each subsequent line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9). The function then prints the product of n and a if b is less than or equal to a, or the sum of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference 1 if b is greater than a. The sum is calculated differently depending on whether b - a is greater than or equal to n. After processing all input lines, the function leaves stdin empty and the variables t, n, a, and b with values between 1 and 10^9.**
