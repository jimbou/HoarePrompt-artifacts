Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the different cases for the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `b` (the number of extroverts) is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `b` and `c` (the number of universals) is less than 3, the program prints -1. This is because in this case, it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts in tents with exactly three people.

2. Otherwise, the program calculates the minimum number of tents needed. It first adds the number of introverts (`a`) to the total number of tents, since each introvert needs a separate tent.

3. Then, it calculates the number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals. If the sum of `b` and `c` is divisible by 3, it simply adds the result of the division to the total number of tents. If the sum is not divisible by 3, it adds the result of the division plus 1 to the total number of tents. This is because in this case, one more tent is needed to accommodate the remaining people.

4. Finally, the program prints the total number of tents needed.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
