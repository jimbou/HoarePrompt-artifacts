To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute.

However, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `i`. Since the loop starts from 0, we can set `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**
