Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and c. For each test case, it calculates a value k based on the divisibility of (b + c) by 3. If (b + c) is divisible by 3, k is set to a + (b + c) // 3. If (b + c) is not divisible by 3, k is set to a + (b + c) // 3 + 1. However, if b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b and c is less than 3, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated value of k. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, leaving the input stream empty afterwards.**
