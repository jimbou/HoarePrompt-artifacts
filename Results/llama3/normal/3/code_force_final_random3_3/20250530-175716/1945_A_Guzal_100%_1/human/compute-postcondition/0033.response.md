Postcondition: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 2, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is a + (b + c) // 3 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, stdin contains n-6 lines, each containing three integers. If (b + c) % 3 != 0, then k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 2. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is being printed, and k is printed, where k is a + (b + c) // 3 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1.**
