Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is 0, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing three integers.**

The first line assigns the values of the first three integers from stdin to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` were previously integers between 0 and 10^9, their values are updated to the specific integers read from stdin. The second line assigns 0 to `k`, which was previously 0, so its value remains unchanged. The third line does not affect any variables. 

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains `n-3` lines, each containing three integers, as one line has been read and processed.
