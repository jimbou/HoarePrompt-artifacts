Based on the initial state, the print statement will execute because the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is true.

The value of `b % 3` is not equal to 0, which means `b` is not divisible by 3. Additionally, `b % 3 + c` is less than 3, which means the sum of the remainder of `b` divided by 3 and `c` is less than 3.

Since the condition is true, the print statement will print -1.

Output: **-1**
