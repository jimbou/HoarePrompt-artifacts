The first line reads three integers from the first line of stdin and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. Stdin now contains `n-1` lines. The second line assigns 0 to `k`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing three integers**
