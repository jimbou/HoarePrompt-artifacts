Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9), `k` is `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus 1, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing three integers. Either `b` is divisible by 3 or `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3. The current value of `b + c` is not divisible by 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now one more than the sum of `a` and one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`. The input in stdin remains the same, with `n-1` lines, each containing three integers. The conditions on `b`, `c`, and `b+c` also remain the same.
