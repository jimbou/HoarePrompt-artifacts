Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 2, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 2, stdin contains n-6 lines, each containing three integers. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of k has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of k is now either a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, or a + (b + c) // 3 + 2 if (b + c) is not divisible by 3. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
