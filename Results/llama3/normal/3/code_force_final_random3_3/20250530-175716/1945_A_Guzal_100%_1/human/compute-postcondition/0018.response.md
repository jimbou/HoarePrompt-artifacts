Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9), `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`, stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the sum of `a` and the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains `n-4` lines, each containing three integers, since one line has been processed.
