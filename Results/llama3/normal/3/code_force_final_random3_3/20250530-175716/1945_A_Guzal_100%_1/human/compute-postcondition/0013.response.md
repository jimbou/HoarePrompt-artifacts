Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing three integers. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b modulo 3 and c is less than 3, -1 is printed. Otherwise, k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c. If b + c is not divisible by 3, k is increased by 1, and the value of k is printed.***
