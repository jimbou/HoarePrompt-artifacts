The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). The first integer `t` is assigned to `n`. The remaining input in stdin is `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).**
