Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing three integers. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is being printed. Otherwise, k is a + (b + c) // 3 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1, stdin contains n-4 lines, each containing three integers, and the value of k is being printed.***
