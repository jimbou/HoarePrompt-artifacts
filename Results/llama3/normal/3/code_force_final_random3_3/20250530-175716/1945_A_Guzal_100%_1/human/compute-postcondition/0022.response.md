Output: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9), `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c)` is divisible by 3, otherwise `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing three integers, and the value of `k` is being printed**
