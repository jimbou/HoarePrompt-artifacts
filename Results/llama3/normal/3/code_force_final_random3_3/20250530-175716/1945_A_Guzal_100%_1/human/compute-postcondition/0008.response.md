Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9), `k` is `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing three integers. Either `b` is divisible by 3 or `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3. The current value of `b + c` is not divisible by 3.**
