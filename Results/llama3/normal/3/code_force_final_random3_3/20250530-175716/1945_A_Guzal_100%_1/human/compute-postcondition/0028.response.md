Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 2, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is a + (b + c) // 3 if (b + c) is divisible by 3, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1, stdin contains n-6 lines, each containing three integers. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated based on the values of a, b, and c. If the sum of b and c is divisible by 3, k is incremented by a plus the integer division of (b + c) by 3. Otherwise, k is incremented by a plus the integer division of (b + c) by 3 plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, one line has been read from the standard input, leaving n-6 lines remaining.
