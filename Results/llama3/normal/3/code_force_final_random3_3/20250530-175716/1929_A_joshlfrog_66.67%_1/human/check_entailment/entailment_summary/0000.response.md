Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which represents the maximum beauty of the array.

The program's logic is sound because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order, which is equivalent to finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and outputting the correct differences for each case.

Correctness: **True**
