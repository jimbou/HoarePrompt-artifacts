The only variable in the loop head is variable `e` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `e` and `t`. If `e` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is 0, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `e` must be increased by 1 so `e` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `l`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`**
