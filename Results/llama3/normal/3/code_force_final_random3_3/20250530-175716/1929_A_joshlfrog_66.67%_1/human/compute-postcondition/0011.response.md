Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x` is equal to `nums[1]`, and if the current value of `nums[1]` is less than 100000000, then `y` is equal to `nums[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to `nums[1]`, which is the second element in the list `nums`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `y` is still dependent on the value of `nums[1]`, which is now equal to `x`.
