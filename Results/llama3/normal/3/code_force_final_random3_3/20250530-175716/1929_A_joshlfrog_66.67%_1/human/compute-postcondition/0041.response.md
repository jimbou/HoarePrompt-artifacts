Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is either its initial value, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]`, and `y` is either its initial value, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]`. If `nums[2]` is greater than the initial value of `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `x` remains either its initial value or `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is greater than the initial value of `x`. `y` is either its initial value or `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is less than the initial value of `y`. If `nums[2]` is less than `y`, then `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `x` and `y` are updated to `nums[2]`.***
