Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to be equal to `nums[1]`. In this case, if the current value of `nums[1]` is less than 100000000, then `y` is equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums[i]` is not greater than `x`, then no changes are made to `x` and `y` remains unchanged.***
