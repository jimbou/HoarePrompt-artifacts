Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is `nums[2]`, `y` is either its initial value or `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is less than the initial value of `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the third element of the list `nums`, which is `nums[2]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
