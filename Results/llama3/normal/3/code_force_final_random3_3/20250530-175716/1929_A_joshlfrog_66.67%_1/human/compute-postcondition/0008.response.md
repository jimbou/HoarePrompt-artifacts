Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `y` is equal to `nums[0]`, `i` is 0, and either `x` is equal to `nums[0]` or `x` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to `nums[0]`, which is also equal to the current value of `x` if `x` is not 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `nums[i]` is less than `y` initially, and now `y` is equal to `nums[0]`, it implies that `nums[0]` is less than the original value of `y`, which was 100000000.
