To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for e in range(t):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `e` is less than `t`. Since `e` is currently 1, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `e` by 1, so that it becomes 2. The other variables in the loop head, `t`, remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `l`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`**
