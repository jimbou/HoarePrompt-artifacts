Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program only finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array and subtracts the minimum from the maximum, which is not the correct solution.

For example, if the input is [1, 3, 2], the program will output 2, but the correct output is 3, which is achieved by arranging the elements as [1, 2, 3] and calculating the sum of the differences as (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
