To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(l):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `l`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `l` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be greater than 1.

The states of other variables (`t`, `e`, `x`, `y`, and `nums`) do not affect the loop's execution and are not adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is either its initial value or `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is greater than the initial value of `x`, `y` is either its initial value or `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is less than the initial value of `y`.**
