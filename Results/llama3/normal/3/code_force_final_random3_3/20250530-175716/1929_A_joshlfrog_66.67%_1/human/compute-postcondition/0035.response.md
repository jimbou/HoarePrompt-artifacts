Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x` is either its initial value or `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is greater than the initial value of `x`, `y` is `nums[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to `nums[1]`, which is the second element of the list `nums` (since indexing starts at 0). The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `x` is still conditional, depending on whether `nums[1]` is greater than its initial value.
