Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is either its initial value, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]`, and `y` is either its initial value, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to `nums[2]` because `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still either its initial value, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]`, depending on the initial value of `x` and the values of `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`. The value of `y` is now either its initial value, `nums[1]`, or `nums[2]`, depending on the initial value of `y` and the values of `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`.
