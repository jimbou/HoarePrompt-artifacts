Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a list of integers. The integers in the list are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for e in range(t):
    l = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    x = 0
    y = 100000000
    for i in range(l):
        if nums[i] > x:
            x = nums[i]
        if nums[i] < y:
            y = nums[i]
    print(x - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `l`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `nums` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, e is 1, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is equal to l, x is the maximum value in nums, and y is the minimum value in nums, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, e is 2, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is equal to l, x is the maximum value in nums, and y is the minimum value in nums, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
