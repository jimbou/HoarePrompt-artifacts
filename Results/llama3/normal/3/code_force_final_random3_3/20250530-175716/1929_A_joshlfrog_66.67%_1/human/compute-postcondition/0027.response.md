Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is equal to `nums[0]` which is greater than 0, `y` is 100000000, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`, which is greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
