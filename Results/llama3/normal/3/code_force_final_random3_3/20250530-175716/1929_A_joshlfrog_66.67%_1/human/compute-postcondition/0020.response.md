Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `l`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `t` and `e` remain unchanged, `l` is still greater than or equal to 0, and `nums` is still a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The loop counter `i` is now equal to the number of test cases `l`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `x` now holds the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and the variable `y` now holds the minimum value found in the list `nums`.
