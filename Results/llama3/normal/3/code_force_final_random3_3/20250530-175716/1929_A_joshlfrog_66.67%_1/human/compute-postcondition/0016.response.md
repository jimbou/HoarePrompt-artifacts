Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `x = nums[i]`: This line assigns the value of the element at index `i` in the list `nums` to the variable `x`.

Now, let's consider the initial state:

* `t` is a positive integer
* `e` is 0
* `l` is greater than 1
* `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
* `i` is 2

Since `i` is 2, we know that `x` will be assigned the value of the third element in the list `nums` (since indexing starts at 0).

The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, and `nums` are not affected by this code. Only the value of `x` is changed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element of `nums`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**
