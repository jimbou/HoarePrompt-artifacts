Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, e is 2, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is equal to l, x is the maximum value in nums, and y is the minimum value in nums.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that `t` and `e` remain unchanged, `l` is the same as the initial length of the list `nums`, `nums` remains the same list of integers, `i` is equal to `l` indicating the loop has finished iterating over the entire list, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`.
