The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `i` is 0, `nums[i]` is the first element of the list `nums`. The initial state specifies that the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, so the new value of `x` is greater than the old value of `x` (which was 0).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first element of `nums`, and `y` is 100000000.**
