Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, e is 0, l is the number of test cases, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 100000000
Code of the loop:
for i in range(l):
    if nums[i] > x:
        x = nums[i]
    if nums[i] < y:
        y = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, and either `x` is equal to `nums[0]` or `x` is 0. If the current value of `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, then `y` is updated to be equal to `nums[0]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to be equal to `nums[1]`. In this case, if the current value of `nums[1]` is less than 100000000, then `y` is equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums[i]` is not greater than `x`, then no changes are made to `x` and `y` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is equal to `nums[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2. If the third element of `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is the third element of `nums`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is the third element of `nums` which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
