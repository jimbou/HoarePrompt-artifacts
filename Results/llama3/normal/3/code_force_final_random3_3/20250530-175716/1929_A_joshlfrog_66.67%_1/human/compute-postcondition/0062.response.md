Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is either the third element of `nums` or its previous value, `y` is the third element of `nums`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to the third element of the list `nums`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `x` remains the same as its previous value, unless the third element of `nums` is greater than `x`, in which case `x` is updated to the third element of `nums`. The values of the other variables, including `t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
