Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x` is either its initial value or `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is greater than the initial value of `x`. If `nums[1]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `y` remains the same.***
