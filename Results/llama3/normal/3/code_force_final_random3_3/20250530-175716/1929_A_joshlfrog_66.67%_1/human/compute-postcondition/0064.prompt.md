Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 2, e is 2, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is equal to l, x is 0, and y is 100000000
Code of the loop:
for i in range(l):
    if nums[i] > x:
        x = nums[i]
    if nums[i] < y:
        y = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is either 0 or the first element of `nums` (if the first element of `nums` is greater than 0). If the first element of `nums` is less than 100000000, `y` is set to the first element of `nums`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1. If the first element of `nums` is greater than 0 and the second element of `nums` is greater than the first element, then `x` is the first element of `nums`. Otherwise, `x` is either 0 or the first element of `nums` (if the first element of `nums` is greater than 0). If the first element of `nums` is less than 100000000, `y` is set to the first element of `nums`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to the second element of `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is either the third element of `nums` or its previous value. If the third element of `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to the third element of `nums`. `y` is either the first element of `nums` (if it's less than 100000000) or 100000000. If the element at index `i` in `nums` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to the element at index `i` in `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
