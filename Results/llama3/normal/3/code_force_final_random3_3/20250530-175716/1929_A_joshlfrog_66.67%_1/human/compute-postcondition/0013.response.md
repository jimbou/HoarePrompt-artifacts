Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `y` is equal to `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to be equal to `nums[1]`. In this case, if the current value of `nums[1]` is less than 100000000, then `y` is equal to `nums[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` is updated to be equal to the second element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `y` is still dependent on the value of `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to be equal to `nums[1]`, and if `nums[1]` is less than 100000000, then `y` is equal to the first element of `nums`.
