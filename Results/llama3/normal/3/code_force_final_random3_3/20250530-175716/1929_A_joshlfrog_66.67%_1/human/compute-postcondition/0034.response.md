Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` is greater than the initial value of `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `x` remains the same. `y` is either its initial value or `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is less than the initial value of `y`.***
