Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0, and either `x` is equal to `nums[0]` or `x` is 0. In the case where `x` is equal to `nums[0]`, the current value of `nums[i]` is equal to `x`. Additionally, the current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.***
