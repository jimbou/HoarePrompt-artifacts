Output State: **t is a positive integer, e is equal to t, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is equal to l, x is the maximum value in nums, and y is the minimum value in nums, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums is being printed**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `e` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables, `l`, `nums`, `i`, `x`, and `y`, will have the same values as in the previous output states, but the loop will have finished executing and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums` will have been printed.
