Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `y` is equal to `nums[0]`, `x` is either its initial value or `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than the initial value of `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to `nums[0]`, which is the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `x` is still dependent on its initial value and the value of `nums[0]`, as specified in the initial state.
