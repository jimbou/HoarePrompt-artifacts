Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, e is 1, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), i is equal to l, x is the maximum value in nums, and y is the minimum value in nums.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for t, e, l, and nums as in the initial state. The variable i will be equal to l, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable x will hold the maximum value in the list nums, and the variable y will hold the minimum value in the list nums.
