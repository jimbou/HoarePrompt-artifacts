Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is either the third element of `nums` or its previous value. If the third element of `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to the third element of `nums`. `y` is either the first element of `nums` (if it's less than 100000000) or 100000000. If the element at index `i` in `nums` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to the element at index `i` in `nums`.***
