State: **`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, and either `x` is equal to `nums[0]` or `x` is 0. If the current value of `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, then `y` is updated to be equal to `nums[0]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
