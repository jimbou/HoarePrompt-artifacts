Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is either 0 or the first element of `nums` (if the first element of `nums` is greater than 0). If the first element of `nums` is less than 100000000, `y` is set to the first element of `nums`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.***
