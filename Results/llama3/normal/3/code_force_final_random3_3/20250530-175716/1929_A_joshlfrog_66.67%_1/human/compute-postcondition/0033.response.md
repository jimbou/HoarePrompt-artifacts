Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x` is `nums[1]`, `y` is either its initial value or `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is less than the initial value of `y`**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the second element of the list `nums` (since `i` is 1), while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `y` is still dependent on the initial value of `y` and the first element of `nums`, as the code does not modify `y`.
