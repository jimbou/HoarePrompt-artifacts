To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `e` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, it is already guaranteed to be at least 1. However, we need to adjust the state of `e` to ensure the loop can start.

At the beginning of the loop, `e` should be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a list of integers. The integers in the list are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**
