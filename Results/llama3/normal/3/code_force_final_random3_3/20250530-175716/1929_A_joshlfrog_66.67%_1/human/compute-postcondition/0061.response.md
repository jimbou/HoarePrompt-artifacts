Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2. If the third element of `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to the third element of `nums`. `y` is either the first element of `nums` (if it's less than 100000000) or 100000000.***
