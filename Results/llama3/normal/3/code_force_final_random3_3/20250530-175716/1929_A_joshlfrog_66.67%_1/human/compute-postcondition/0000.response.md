The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of elements in the array) and then a list of integers, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a list of integers. The integers in the list are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**
