To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. The loop will execute if `l` is at least 1. Since `i` is equal to `l` before the loop starts, we need to adjust `i` to be 0 (the starting value of the range) and `l` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, stdin contains 0 inputs**
