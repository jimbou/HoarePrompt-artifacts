Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `y` is 100000000. The current value of `x` is either 0 or the first element of `nums` (if the first element of `nums` is greater than 0). Additionally, the current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**
