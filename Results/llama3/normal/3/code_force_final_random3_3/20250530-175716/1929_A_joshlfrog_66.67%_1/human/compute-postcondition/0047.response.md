To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. The loop will execute if `l` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is 0, and `y` is 100000000**
