Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `y` is the third element of `nums` which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and if the third element of `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is the third element of `nums` which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the third element of the list `nums`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
