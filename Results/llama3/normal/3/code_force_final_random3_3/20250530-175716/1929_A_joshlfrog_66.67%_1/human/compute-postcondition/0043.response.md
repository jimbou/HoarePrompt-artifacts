Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, which means it is the largest integer in the list.
* `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`, which means it is the smallest integer in the list.
* The `print` statement is printing the difference between `x` and `y`, which is `x - y`.

Since `x` is the maximum value and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`, the difference `x - y` represents the range of values in the list.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Output: **the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums**
