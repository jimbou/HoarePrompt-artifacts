Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `y` is 100000000. The current value of `x` is either its initial value or `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than the initial value of `x`. The current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.***
