Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum and minimum elements in the array and then subtracting the minimum from the maximum. However, this approach is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, whereas the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program does not take into account the order of the elements in the array.

For example, consider the array [1, 3, 2]. The program would calculate the beauty as 3 - 1 = 2, but the correct beauty is (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
