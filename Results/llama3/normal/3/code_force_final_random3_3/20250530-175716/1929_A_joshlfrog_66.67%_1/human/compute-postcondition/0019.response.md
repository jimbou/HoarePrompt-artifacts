Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2. If the third element of `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is the third element of `nums`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is the third element of `nums` which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).***
