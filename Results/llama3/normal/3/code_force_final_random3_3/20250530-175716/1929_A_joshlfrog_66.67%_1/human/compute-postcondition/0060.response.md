Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is the third element of `nums`, `y` is either the first element of `nums` (if it's less than 100000000) or 100000000**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the third element of the list `nums`, since `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
