Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which includes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The values of `n` and `a_i` are still within their respective ranges.
