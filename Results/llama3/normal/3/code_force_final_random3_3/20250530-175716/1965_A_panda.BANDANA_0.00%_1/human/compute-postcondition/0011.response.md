Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, l is a list of integers, e is a set of integers, m is an integer equal to the length of l, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin, assigning the first line to `n` and the second line to `l` as a list of integers. The set `e` is created from the list `l`, containing unique integers from `l`. The variable `m` is assigned the length of `l`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains `t-3` test cases as two test cases have been read.
