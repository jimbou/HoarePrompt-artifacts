Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case that must have at least 1 element, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is a dictionary with key (num % x, num % y) and value 1, num is the first element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is 0 + the value of residue_map for key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, otherwise 0**

The code block updates the values of `r_x`, `r_y`, `count`, `current_key`, and `residue_map`. The first two lines reassign the values of `r_x` and `r_y` based on the current value of `num`. The third line increments the value of `count` by the value of `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists, otherwise it adds 0. The fourth line updates the value of `current_key` to `(num % x, num % y)`. The fifth line updates the value of `residue_map` for the key `current_key` to 1 if it does not exist, or increments its value by 1 if it does exist.
