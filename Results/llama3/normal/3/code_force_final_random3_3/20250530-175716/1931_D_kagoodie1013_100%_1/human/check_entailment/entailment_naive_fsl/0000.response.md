Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a residue map to store the count of numbers with the same residue modulo x and y. For each number in the array, it calculates the residue modulo x and y, and then checks if there is a pair with the same residue in the map. If there is, it increments the count. The program also handles the case where the same number appears multiple times in the array.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases, including when x or y is 1, when the array contains duplicate numbers, and when the array contains numbers that are not divisible by x or y.

The program also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array, which is efficient for large inputs.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
