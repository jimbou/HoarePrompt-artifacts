Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is an empty dictionary, num is the last element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is 0**

The code resets the value of `count` to 0 and reinitializes `residue_map` as an empty dictionary. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
