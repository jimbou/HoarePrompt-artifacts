Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is a dictionary with key (num % x, num % y) and value 1, num is the third element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is the value of residue_map for key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, otherwise 0, residue_map[current_key] is incremented by 1**.

The code block modifies the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the value associated with the key `(num % x, num % y)` by 1. The `current_key` variable is updated to `(num % x, num % y)`, and the `count` variable is updated to the value of `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists, otherwise 0. The values of `r_x` and `r_y` are updated based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
