Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is a dictionary with keys (num % x, num % y) and values equal to the number of times each key appears in arr, num is the last element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is the value of residue_map for key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, otherwise 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all elements in the list `arr`. The `residue_map` dictionary now contains all the unique pairs of remainders `(num % x, num % y)` as keys and their respective counts as values. The `count` variable holds the count of the last pair of remainders `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists in the `residue_map`, otherwise it is 0. The `num` variable holds the last element in `arr`, and `r_x` and `r_y` hold the corresponding remainders. The `current_key` variable holds the last pair of remainders `(num % x, num % y)`. The `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `results` variables remain unchanged.
