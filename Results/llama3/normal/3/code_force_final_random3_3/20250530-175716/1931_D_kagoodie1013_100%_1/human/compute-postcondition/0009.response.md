Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is an empty list, results is an empty list, count is the sum of the number of times each residue pair appears in the residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, num is the last integer in the list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is num % x, num % y**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all integers in the list `arr`. The list `arr` is now empty, indicating that all integers have been processed. The `count` variable now holds the total count of all residue pairs in the `residue_map`. The `residue_map` dictionary contains the frequency of each residue pair. The `num` variable holds the last integer processed, and `r_x` and `r_y` hold the corresponding residue values. The `current_key` variable holds the last residue pair processed.
