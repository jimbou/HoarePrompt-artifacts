The code initializes two new variables: `count` and `residue_map`. The `count` variable is set to 0, and the `residue_map` variable is set to an empty dictionary. 

Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is the list of integers in the first test case, results is an empty list, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary**
