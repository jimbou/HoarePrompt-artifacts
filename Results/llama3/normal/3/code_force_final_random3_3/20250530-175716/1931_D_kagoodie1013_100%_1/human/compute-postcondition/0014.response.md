Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the second test case, arr is a list with at least 1 element, results is an empty list, residue_map is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is (num % x, num % y) and the value is 1, num is the first element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is 0 or 1 depending on whether (r_x, r_y) was already a key in residue_map.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `residue_map` now contains a key-value pair where the key is `(num % x, num % y)` and the value is 1, indicating that the residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` has been encountered once. The `num` variable remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The `r_x` and `r_y` variables are assigned the values `-num % x` and `num % y`, respectively. The `current_key` variable is assigned the value `(num % x, num % y)`, which is the same as the key in the `residue_map`. The `count` variable is incremented by 0 or 1, depending on whether the key `(r_x, r_y)` was already present in the `residue_map`.
