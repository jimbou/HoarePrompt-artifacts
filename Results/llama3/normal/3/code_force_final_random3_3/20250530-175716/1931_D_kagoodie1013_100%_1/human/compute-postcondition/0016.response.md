Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the second test case, arr is a list with at least 2 elements, results is an empty list, residue_map is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where the key is (num % x, num % y) and the value is 1, and another key (r_x, r_y) with a value of count + 1, num is the second element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is 0 or 1 depending on whether (r_x, r_y) was already a key in residue_map, incremented by 1 if (r_x, r_y) was already a key in residue_map.**

The code block modifies the `residue_map` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair with the key being `(num % x, num % y)` and the value being 1, and increments the value of the key `(r_x, r_y)` by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary. The `count` variable is also incremented by 1 if `(r_x, r_y)` was already a key in `residue_map`. The `current_key` variable is updated to `(num % x, num % y)`. The values of `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the value of `num`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
