Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is the list of integers in the first test case, results is an empty list, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    r_x = -num % x
    r_y = num % y
    count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
    current_key = num % x, num % y
    residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list, results is an empty list, count is the previous count plus the number of times the residue pair (r_x, r_y) appears in the residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, results is an empty list, count is the previous count plus the number of times the residue pair (r_x, r_y) appears in the residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is num % x, num % y

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, results is an empty list, count is the previous count plus the number of times the residue pair (r_x, r_y) appears in the residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is num % x, num % y, and the values of r_x, r_y, count, and residue_map[current_key] have been updated according to the given code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
