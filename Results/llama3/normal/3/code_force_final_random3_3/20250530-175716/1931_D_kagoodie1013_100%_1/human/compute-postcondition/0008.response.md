Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, results is an empty list, count is the previous count plus the number of times the residue pair (r_x, r_y) appears in the residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is num % x, num % y, and the values of r_x, r_y, count, and residue_map[current_key] have been updated according to the given code.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, with the exception of a few variables that were modified by the code. The variables `r_x` and `r_y` have been updated to `-num % x` and `num % y`, respectively. The `count` variable has been incremented by the number of times the residue pair `(r_x, r_y)` appears in the `residue_map`. The `residue_map` dictionary has been updated to include the key `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears. The `current_key` variable has been updated to `(num % x, num % y)`. All other variables, including `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, and `results`, remain unchanged.
