To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the first test case, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list with one element which is the sum of the number of times each residue pair appears in the `residue_map`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, `num` is the last integer in the list, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will take the values of the second test case. The other variables `results`, `residue_map`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` will be reset to their initial values.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the second test case, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is an empty list, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is not defined, `r_x` is not defined, `r_y` is not defined, `current_key` is not defined**
