Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the second test case, arr is a list with all elements, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is a dictionary with all key-value pairs where the key is (num % x, num % y) and the value is the number of times that key appears in arr, num is the last element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr.**

In natural language, the output state is that the results list now contains the total count of the number of times the key (r_x, r_y) appears in the array arr. All other variables remain unchanged.
