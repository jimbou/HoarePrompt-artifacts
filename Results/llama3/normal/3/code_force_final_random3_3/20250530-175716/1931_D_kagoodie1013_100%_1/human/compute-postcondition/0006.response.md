Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, results is an empty list, count is the previous count plus the number of times the residue pair (r_x, r_y) appears in the residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is num % x, num % y**.

In this output state, the values of `r_x` and `r_y` have been updated based on the value of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The `count` variable has been incremented by the number of times the residue pair `(r_x, r_y)` appears in the `residue_map`. The `residue_map` has been updated with the new key-value pair `(current_key, 1)`, where `current_key` is the tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
