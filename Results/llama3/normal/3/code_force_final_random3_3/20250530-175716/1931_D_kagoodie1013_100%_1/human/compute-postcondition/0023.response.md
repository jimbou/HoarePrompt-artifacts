To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the last element in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 element and `num` is the first element in `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the third test case, `arr` is the list in the third test case that must have at least 1 element, `results` is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is num % y, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `count` is 0**
