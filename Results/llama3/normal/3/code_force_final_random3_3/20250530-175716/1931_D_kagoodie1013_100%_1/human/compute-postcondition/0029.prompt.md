Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is an empty dictionary, num is the last element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is 0
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    r_x = -num % x
    r_y = num % y
    count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
    current_key = num % x, num % y
    residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case that must have at least 1 element, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is a dictionary with key (num % x, num % y) and value 1, num is the first element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is 0 + the value of residue_map for key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is a dictionary with key (num % x, num % y) and value 1, num is the second element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is the value of residue_map for key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case that must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is a dictionary with key (num % x, num % y) and value 1, num is the third element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is the value of residue_map for key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, otherwise 0, residue_map[current_key] is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
