Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the last test case, `arr` is the list in the last test case, `results` is a list with the total number of times that `(r_x, r_y)` appears in `arr` for each test case, `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys `(num % x, num % y)` and values equal to the number of times each key appears in `arr`, `num` is the last element in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `count` is the value of `residue_map` for key `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists, otherwise 0**

The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables after processing all test cases. The `test_cases` list is now empty, as all test cases have been processed. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` are the last values encountered during the loop execution, which correspond to the last test case. The `results` list contains the total count of residue pairs for each test case. The `residue_map` dictionary contains the final count of residue pairs for the last test case. The `count` variable holds the final count of residue pairs for the last test case.
