Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the second test case, arr is a list with at least 3 elements, results is an empty list, residue_map is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where the key is (num % x, num % y) and the value is 1, and another key (r_x, r_y) with a value of count + 1, num is the third element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is 0 or 1 depending on whether (r_x, r_y) was already a key in residue_map, incremented by 1 if (r_x, r_y) was already a key in residue_map, residue_map[current_key] is 1 or 2 depending on whether current_key was already a key in residue_map, incremented by 1 if current_key was already a key in residue_map**

Explanation:
The code block consists of four lines. The first line calculates the value of `r_x` as `-num % x`, which is the negative remainder of `num` divided by `x`. The second line calculates the value of `r_y` as `num % y`, which is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. The third line increments the value of `count` by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, which is the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` dictionary, or 0 if the key does not exist. The fourth line updates the value associated with the key `current_key` in the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing it by 1.

The final output state reflects the changes made by the code block. The values of `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The value of `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` dictionary. The value associated with the key `current_key` in the `residue_map` dictionary is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
