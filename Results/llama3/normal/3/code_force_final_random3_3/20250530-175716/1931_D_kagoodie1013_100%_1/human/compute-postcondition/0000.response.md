Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, `results` is an empty list**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `results` which is an empty list. The `test_cases` variable remains unchanged, still containing a list of test cases with three integers and a list of n integers.
