Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the first test case, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list with one element which is the sum of the number of times each residue pair appears in the `residue_map`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, `num` is the last integer in the list, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the `results` list now contains the count of residue pairs from the `residue_map`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
