Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the second test case, arr is a list with all elements, results is an empty list, residue_map is a dictionary with all key-value pairs where the key is (num % x, num % y) and the value is the number of times that key appears in arr, num is the last element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `residue_map` dictionary will contain all the residue pairs (r_x, r_y) as keys and their respective counts as values. The `num` variable will hold the last element of the `arr` list, and `r_x` and `r_y` will hold the residues of the last element modulo `x` and `y`, respectively. The `current_key` will be the residue pair of the last element, and the `count` will be the total number of times that residue pair appears in the `arr` list. The other variables, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `results`, remain unchanged.
