The only object in the loop head is variable  num and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the num is the second integer in the list.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, results is an empty list, count is the previous count plus the number of times the residue pair (r_x, r_y) appears in the residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y**
