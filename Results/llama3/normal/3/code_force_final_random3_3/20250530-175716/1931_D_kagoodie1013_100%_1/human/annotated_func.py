    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total number of times that `(r_x, r_y)` appears in `arr` for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the residues modulo x and y for each integer, and counting the occurrences of each residue pair. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total count of residue pairs for each test case.
