According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least 1 element. Additionally, the variable `num` is introduced in the loop head, which will take the value of the first element in `arr` at the start of the loop.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the second test case, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `r_x` is not defined, `r_y` is not defined, `current_key` is not defined, `count` is 0**
