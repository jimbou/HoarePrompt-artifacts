To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the first test case, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, and `residue_map` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 integer and `num` is the first integer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the first test case, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary**
