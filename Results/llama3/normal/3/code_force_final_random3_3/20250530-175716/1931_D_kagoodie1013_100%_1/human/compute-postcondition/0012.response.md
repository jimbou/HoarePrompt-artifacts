Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the second test case, arr is an empty list, results is an empty list, residue_map is an empty dictionary, num is not defined, r_x is not defined, r_y is not defined, current_key is not defined, count is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line initializes a variable `count` to 0. The second line reinitializes the `residue_map` to an empty dictionary. The initial state of `residue_map` was an empty dictionary, so this line does not change its state. The other variables remain unaffected by the code.
