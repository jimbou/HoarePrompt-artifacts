Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, n, x, y are the first three integers in the first test case, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list, results is an empty list, count is the previous count plus the number of times the residue pair (r_x, r_y) appears in the residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times this residue pair appears, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is still the first integer in the list `arr`. The value of `count` is incremented by the number of times the residue pair `(r_x, r_y)` appears in the `residue_map`. The `residue_map` now contains a new key-value pair, where the key is the residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` and the value is the number of times this residue pair appears. The values of `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the value of `num` and the values of `x` and `y`.
