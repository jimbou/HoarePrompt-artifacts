To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for num in arr:`, so we can only adjust the state of `num` and `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second element in `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` must be the third element in `arr`.

State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the second test case, arr is a list with at least 3 elements, results is an empty list, residue_map is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where the key is (num % x, num % y) and the value is 1, and another key (r_x, r_y) with a value of count + 1, num is the third element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is 0 or 1 depending on whether (r_x, r_y) was already a key in residue_map, incremented by 1 if (r_x, r_y) was already a key in residue_map**
