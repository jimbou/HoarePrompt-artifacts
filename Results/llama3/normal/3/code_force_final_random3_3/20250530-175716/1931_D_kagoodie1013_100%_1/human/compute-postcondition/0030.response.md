The code appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The value of `count` is the value of `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists, otherwise 0. The value of `r_x` is `-num % x` and the value of `r_y` is `num % y`. The value of `num` is the last element in `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the third test case, `arr` is the list in the third test case, `results` is a list with the total number of times that `(r_x, r_y)` appears in `arr` and the value of `count` is appended to it, `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys `(num % x, num % y)` and values equal to the number of times each key appears in `arr`, `num` is the last element in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `count` is the value of `residue_map` for key `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists, otherwise 0**
