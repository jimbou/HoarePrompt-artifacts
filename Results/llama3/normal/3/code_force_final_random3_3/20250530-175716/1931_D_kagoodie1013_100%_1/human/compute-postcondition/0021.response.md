To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop statement is: `for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:`

The variables in the loop head are `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`.

According to the loop statement, the loop will execute again if there are more test cases in `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, and `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the second test case.

To execute the loop again, `test_cases` must have at least 3 test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be the first three integers and the list in the third test case, respectively.

The other variables `results`, `residue_map`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

The adjusted state is:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `n`, `x`, `y` are the first three integers in the third test case, `arr` is the list in the third test case, `results` is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, `residue_map` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs where the key is (num % x, num % y) and the value is the number of times that key appears in arr, `num` is the last element in arr, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is num % y, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `count` is the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr**
