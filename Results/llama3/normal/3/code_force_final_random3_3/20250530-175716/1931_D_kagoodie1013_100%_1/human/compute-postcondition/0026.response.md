Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, n, x, y are the first three integers in the third test case, arr is the list in the third test case that must have at least 2 elements, results is a list with the total number of times that (r_x, r_y) appears in arr, residue_map is a dictionary with key (num % x, num % y) and value 1, num is the second element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y), count is the value of residue_map for key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, otherwise 0**
