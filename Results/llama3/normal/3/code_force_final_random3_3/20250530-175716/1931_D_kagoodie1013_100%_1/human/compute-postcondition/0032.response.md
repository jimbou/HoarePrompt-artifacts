Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the total number of times that `(r_x, r_y)` appears in `arr` for each test case.**

In this output state, each integer in the `results` list corresponds to a test case. The value of each integer is the total number of times that the pair `(r_x, r_y)` appears in the list `arr` for that test case. The pair `(r_x, r_y)` is calculated based on the last element `num` in `arr`, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y`. The count of `(r_x, r_y)` is obtained from the `residue_map` dictionary, which stores the frequency of each pair `(num % x, num % y)` in `arr`. If the pair `(r_x, r_y)` does not exist in `residue_map`, its count is 0.
