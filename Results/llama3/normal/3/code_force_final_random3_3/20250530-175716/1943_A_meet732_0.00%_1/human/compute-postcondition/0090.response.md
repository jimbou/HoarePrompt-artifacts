Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty. The value at index 0 of `cntl` is not equal to 0***
