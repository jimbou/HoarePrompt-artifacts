Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the count of each integer in the list `a`. This is done to efficiently calculate the MEX of the list `c` that Alice will construct.

3. The program then checks if the count of 0 in the list `a` is 0. If it is, the program prints 0, which is correct because the MEX of an empty list is 0.

4. If the count of 0 is not 0, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0. This is because Alice can always choose at least one 0, and if there are two 0s, she can choose both.

5. The program then iterates over the list `cntl` starting from index 1. For each index `j`, if the count of `j` is less than 2, it decrements `c` by 1. This is because if the count of `j` is less than 2, Bob can choose `j` and prevent Alice from choosing it.

6. If `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j`. This is correct because if `c` becomes 0, it means that Alice cannot choose any more numbers, and the MEX of the list `c` is `j`. If `j` reaches `n`, it means that Alice has chosen all numbers up to `n - 1`, and the MEX of the list `c` is `n`.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the final score of the game if both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
