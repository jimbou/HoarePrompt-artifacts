Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the value at index 0 of `cntl` minus 1, `j` is 1, stdin is empty. The value at index 0 of `cntl` is not equal to 0. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 1, the list `a` remains empty, the list `cntl` still has a length of `n + 1` and its values represent the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`. The value of `_` is still 2, and `i` is still the last integer in the original list `a`. The value of `c` has decreased by 1, but it is still the minimum of 2 and the value at index 0 of `cntl`. The value of `j` is still 1, and the stdin is still empty. The value at index 0 of `cntl` is still not equal to 0, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is still less than 2.
