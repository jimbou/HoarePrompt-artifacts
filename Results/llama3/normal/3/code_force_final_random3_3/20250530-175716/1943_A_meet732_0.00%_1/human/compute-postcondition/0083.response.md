Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at index `i` is 2 and all other values are 0, `_` is 2, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` still has a length of `n + 1`, but now the value at index `i` is 2, and all other values are 0. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
