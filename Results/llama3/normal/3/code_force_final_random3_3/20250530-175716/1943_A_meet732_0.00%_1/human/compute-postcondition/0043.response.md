The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 1 element, i is the first integer in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**
