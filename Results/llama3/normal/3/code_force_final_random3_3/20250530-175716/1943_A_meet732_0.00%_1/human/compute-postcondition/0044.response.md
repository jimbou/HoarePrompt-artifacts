Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is 2 and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` now has `cntl[i]` equal to 2, and the rest of its elements are still 0. All other variables maintain their initial values and properties.
