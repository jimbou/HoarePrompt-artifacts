To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the value at index 0 of `cntl`, `j` is 1, stdin is empty. The value at index 0 of `cntl` is not equal to 0**
