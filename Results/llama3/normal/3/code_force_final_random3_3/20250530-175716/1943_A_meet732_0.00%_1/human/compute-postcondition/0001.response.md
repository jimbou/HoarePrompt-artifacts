The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases and input is at least 1, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, `a` becomes a list of integers. The third line creates a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` and assigns it to `cntl`.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, _ is 0**
