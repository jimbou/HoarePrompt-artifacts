Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 1, `j` is 1, `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
