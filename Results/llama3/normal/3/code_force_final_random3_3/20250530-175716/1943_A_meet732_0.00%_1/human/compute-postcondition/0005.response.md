Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 2, `_` is 0, `i` is the second integer in the list**

The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. The initial value of `cntl[i]` was 1, so the new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
