Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at index `i` is 1 and all other values are 0, `_` is 2, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while all other values in the `cntl` list remain 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
