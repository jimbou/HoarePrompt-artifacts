Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX score. Here's why:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using the `cntl` list.
2. If there are no zeros in the array, the MEX score is 0, and the program prints 0.
3. If there are zeros in the array, the program initializes the MEX score `c` to 2 (since Alice can always choose a zero on her first turn).
4. The program then iterates through the `cntl` list, starting from 1. For each number `j`, if its count is less than 2, it means Bob can remove one of these numbers on his turn, reducing the MEX score. The program decrements `c` by 1.
5. If `c` becomes 0 or the program reaches the end of the `cntl` list (i.e., `j == n`), it means the MEX score is `j`, and the program prints `j`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If there are no zeros, the MEX score is 0.
* If there are zeros, the program tries to maximize the MEX score by choosing a zero on Alice's first turn and then adjusting the score based on the counts of other numbers.
* If Bob can remove a number on his turn, the program correctly reduces the MEX score.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
