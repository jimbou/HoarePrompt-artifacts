Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`, `j` is 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.***
