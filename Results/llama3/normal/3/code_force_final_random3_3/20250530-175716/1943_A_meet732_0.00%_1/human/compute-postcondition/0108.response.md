To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue executing.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`, which means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer that must be at least 1
* `a` is an empty list
* `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`
* `_` is 2
* `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`
* `j` is 2

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to continue executing. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

Since `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` will be 3. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

* `n` is an integer that must be at least 1 (no change)
* `a` is an empty list (no change)
* `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a` (no change)
* `_` is 2 (no change)
* `i` is the last integer in the original list `a` (no change)
* `j` is 3 (incremented by 1)

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `j` is 3**
