The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. The value of `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, so the value of `cntl[i]` was 0 before the increment. Therefore, the value of `cntl[i]` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 1, `_` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list**
