Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `j` is 1, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2. This means that the number of occurrences of 1 in the list `a` is less than 2.
* The current value of `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`. Since `j` is 1, it cannot be equal to `n` (which is at least 1), so `c` must be 0.

Now, let's look at the print statement:
```
print(j)
```
Since `j` is 1, the print statement will output the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
