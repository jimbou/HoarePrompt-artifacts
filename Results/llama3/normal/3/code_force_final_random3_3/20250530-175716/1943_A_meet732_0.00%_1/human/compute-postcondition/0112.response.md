Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `j` is 3, `c` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `c` is decreased by 1, but its initial value is not specified, so we can only describe the change relative to its previous value. The value of `j` is still being printed, which is 3.
