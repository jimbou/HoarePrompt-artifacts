Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`. If the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` is 0, then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is at least 1, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus the number of iterations of the loop, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus the number of iterations of the loop. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
