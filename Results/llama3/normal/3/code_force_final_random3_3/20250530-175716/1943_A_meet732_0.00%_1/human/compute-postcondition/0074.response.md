Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 1 if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, otherwise `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a`, minus 1, `j` is 3, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 3. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
