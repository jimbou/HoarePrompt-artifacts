Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `cntl` now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, where `cntl[i]` represents the number of times `i` appears in `a`. The variable `i` now holds the last integer in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
