Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl` minus 1, and `j` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `j` which is 3 has been printed.
