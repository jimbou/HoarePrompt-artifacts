Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl` minus 1, and `j` is 3. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
