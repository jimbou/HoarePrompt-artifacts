Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 1, `j` is 1, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2. The current value of `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`***
