The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of iterations of the loop, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`.**
