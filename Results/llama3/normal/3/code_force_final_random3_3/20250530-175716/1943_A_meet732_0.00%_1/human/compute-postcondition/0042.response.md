Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The rest of the elements in the `cntl` list remain 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
