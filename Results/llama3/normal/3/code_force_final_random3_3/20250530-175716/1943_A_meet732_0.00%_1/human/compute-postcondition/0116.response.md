Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `j` is `n`, and stdin is empty. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, `c` is 0 and the value at index 0 of `cntl` is not equal to 0.***
