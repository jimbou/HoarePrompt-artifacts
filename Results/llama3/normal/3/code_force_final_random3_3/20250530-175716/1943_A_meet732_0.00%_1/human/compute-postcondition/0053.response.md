To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a`, `j` is 1, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0**
