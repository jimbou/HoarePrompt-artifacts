Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl` minus 1, and `j` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` is decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `c` is now one less than the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`. All other variables retain their initial values.
