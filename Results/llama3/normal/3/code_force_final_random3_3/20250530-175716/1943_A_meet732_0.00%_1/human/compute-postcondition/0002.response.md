The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, cntl is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `_` is 0, `i` is the first integer in the list**
