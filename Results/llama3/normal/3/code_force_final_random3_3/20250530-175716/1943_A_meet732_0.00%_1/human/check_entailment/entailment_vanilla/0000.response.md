Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
3. It creates a count array `cntl` of size `n+1` to keep track of the frequency of each element in `a`.
4. It iterates over the elements of `a` and increments the corresponding count in `cntl`.
5. If the count of 0 in `cntl` is 0, it prints 0 as the final score, since the MEX of an empty array is 0.
6. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0 in `cntl`. This is because Alice can pick at most two 0s to maximize the MEX.
7. It then iterates over the elements of `cntl` starting from 1. For each element, if the count is less than 2, it decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0 or the current element is the last element in `cntl`, it prints the current element as the final score.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she picks the smallest possible elements that will increase the MEX. Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he picks the largest possible elements that will decrease the MEX. The program's use of the count array `cntl` and the variable `c` effectively simulates this optimal strategy.

Correctness: **True**
