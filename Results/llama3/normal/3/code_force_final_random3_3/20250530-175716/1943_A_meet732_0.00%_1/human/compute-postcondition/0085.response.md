Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at index `i` is 3 and all other values are 0 except the value at index 0 which is 2, `_` is 2, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cntl` at index `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
