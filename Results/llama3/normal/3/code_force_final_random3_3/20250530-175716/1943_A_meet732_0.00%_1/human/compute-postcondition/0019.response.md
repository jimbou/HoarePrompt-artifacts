Output: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is `cntl[1] - 1`, `j` is 1. The current value of `c` is either 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, and the value of `j` which is 1 is being printed**
