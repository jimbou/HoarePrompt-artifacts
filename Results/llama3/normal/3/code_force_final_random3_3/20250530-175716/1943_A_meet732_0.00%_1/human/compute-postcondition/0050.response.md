Output: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0, meaning the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` is 0, and the number 0 is being printed**
