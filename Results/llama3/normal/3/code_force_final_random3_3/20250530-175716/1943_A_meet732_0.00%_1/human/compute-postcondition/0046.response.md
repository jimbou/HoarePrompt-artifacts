Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is 3 and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` still has a length of `n + 1`, and the other elements are still 0. The other variables `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `c`, and `j` retain their original values and properties.
