The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at index `i` is 1 and all other values are 0, `_` is 2, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty**
