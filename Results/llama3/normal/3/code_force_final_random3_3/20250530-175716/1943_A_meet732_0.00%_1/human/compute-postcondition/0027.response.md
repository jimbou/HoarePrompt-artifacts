Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The value of `j` which is 2 has been printed.
