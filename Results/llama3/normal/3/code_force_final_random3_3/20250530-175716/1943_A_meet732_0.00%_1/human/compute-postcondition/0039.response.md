The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0. For the loop to execute again, _ must be 1 and the value returned by int(input()) must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, cntl is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 except for the index i which is the number of times i appears in a, _ is 1, i is the last integer in the list. If cntl[0] is 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, c is the minimum of 2 and the first element of cntl, and j is n.**
