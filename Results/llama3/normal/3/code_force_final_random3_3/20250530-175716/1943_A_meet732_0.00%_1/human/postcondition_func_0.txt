This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and prints the smallest integer that appears at least twice, or 0 if no such integer exists. If the list contains no zeros, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
