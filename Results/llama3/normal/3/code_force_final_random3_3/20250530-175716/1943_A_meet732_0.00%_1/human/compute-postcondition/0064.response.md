Based on the initial state, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.
* `a` is a list of integers.
* `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0.
* `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the code).
* `i` is the last integer in the list `a`.
* `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 1.
* `j` is 2.
* `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.

The code prints the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
