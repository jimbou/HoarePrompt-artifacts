Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is `cntl[1] - 1`, `j` is 1. The current value of `c` is either 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, and the value of `j` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement that we broke out of.
