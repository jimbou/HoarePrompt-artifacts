Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a`, `j` is `n`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a`, `j` is 1, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 1 if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, otherwise `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a`, `j` is 2, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 2. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 1 if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, otherwise `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus 3. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
