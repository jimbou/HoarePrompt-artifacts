Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, cntl is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 except for the index i which is the number of times i appears in a, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list. If cntl[0] is 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, c is the minimum of 2 and the first element of cntl, and j is n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`. If the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` is 0, then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is at least 1, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus the number of iterations of the loop, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum of 2 and the number of occurrences of 0 in `a` minus the number of iterations of the loop. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `j` is `n`, and stdin is empty. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, `c` is 0 and the value at index 0 of `cntl` is not equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
