According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `a` must have at least 2 integers and `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is 1, `_` is 0, `i` is the second integer in the list**
