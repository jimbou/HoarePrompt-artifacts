To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next integer in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where `cntl[i]` is 2 and the rest are 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**
