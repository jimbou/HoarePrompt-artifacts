Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, cntl is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 except for the index i which is the number of times i appears in a, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all its elements have been processed, the list `cntl` will have counts of each integer in `a` at their respective indices, and `i` will be the last integer that was processed from `a`. The variables `n` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
