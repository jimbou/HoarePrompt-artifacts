To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop will execute if the list `a` has at least one element. Since `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, we can adjust its state to be the first integer in the list `a` for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `_` is 1, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**
