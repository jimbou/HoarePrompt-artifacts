Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at each index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is the last integer in the original list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the value at index 0 of `cntl` minus 1, `j` is 1, stdin is empty. The value at index 0 of `cntl` is not equal to 0. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`***
