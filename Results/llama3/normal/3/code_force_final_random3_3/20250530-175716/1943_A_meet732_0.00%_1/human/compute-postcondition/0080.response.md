To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to be the first integer in the list `a`. The list `a` must have at least 1 integer for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer from stdin, `a` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `_` is 2, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `stdin` is empty, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`**
