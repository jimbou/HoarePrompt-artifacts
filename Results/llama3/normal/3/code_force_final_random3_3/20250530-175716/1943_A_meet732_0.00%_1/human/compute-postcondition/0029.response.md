Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except for the index `i` which is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl` minus 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
