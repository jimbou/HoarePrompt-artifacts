Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer from stdin, a is a list of integers from stdin, cntl is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, _ is 2, i is the last integer in the list a, stdin is empty, c is either 0 or 1 or 2, j is n.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    cntl[i] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at index `i` is 1 and all other values are 0, `_` is 2, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at index `i` is 2 and all other values are 0, `_` is 2, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at index `i` is 3 and all other values are 0 except the value at index 0 which is 2, `_` is 2, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
