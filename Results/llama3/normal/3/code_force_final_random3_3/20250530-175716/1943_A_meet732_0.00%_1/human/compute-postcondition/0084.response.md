To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more integer. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `a` to have at least 3 integers.

Since `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, we can adjust its state to be the third integer in the list `a`.

The other variables (`n`, `cntl`, `_`, `c`, `j`, and stdin) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1` where the value at index `i` is 2 and all other values are 0, `_` is 2, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `j` is `n`, stdin is empty**
