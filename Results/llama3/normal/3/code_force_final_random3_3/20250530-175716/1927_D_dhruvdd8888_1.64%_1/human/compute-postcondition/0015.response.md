Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is N, LA is the second last index of arr.**

In this output state, the value of LA is the second last index of arr, which is calculated by subtracting 1 from the length of arr. The other variables remain unchanged, with N being an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums being a list of N+1 integers, s being the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e being 0, num being the last integer in the list of N integers, arr being a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, stdin containing the remaining test cases, and i being N.
