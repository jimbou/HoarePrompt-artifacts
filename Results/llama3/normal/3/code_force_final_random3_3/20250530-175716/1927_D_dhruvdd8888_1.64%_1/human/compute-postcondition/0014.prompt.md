Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of N integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains the remaining test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the current value of nums[i], arr is an empty list, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 0. If nums[i] is not equal to the original value of num, then s is set to i, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of N integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + original value of s, original value of i, original value of num), stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 0, and the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the original value of num. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 1, num is the current value of nums[1], if nums[1] is not equal to the current value of num, then s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing the tuple (1, 1, nums[1]).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 2, num is the current value of nums[2]. If nums[2] is not equal to the current value of nums[2], then s is 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing the tuples (2, 2, nums[2]) and (3, 2, nums[2]). Otherwise, the state of s, e, and arr remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
