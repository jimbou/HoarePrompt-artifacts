Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, l is an integer, r is an integer, i is N, LA is the second last index of arr, nums is being printed, and stdin contains at least one remaining test case. If tc is greater than 5, the current value of tc is greater than 5. If ppp is 23, the values of l and r are being printed. Otherwise, no additional actions are performed.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s` and `e`. The first line uses the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`. This line does not modify any variables. The second line assigns the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA` in the list `arr`. Since `eli` is the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`, it represents the index where the subsequence of equal integers starting at `l` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. The `min` function ensures that the index does not exceed the second last index `LA` of `arr`. The values of `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the subsequence of equal integers in `nums` that contains the last index `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
