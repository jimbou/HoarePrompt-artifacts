Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 1, num is the current value of nums[1], if nums[1] is not equal to the current value of num, then s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing the tuple (1, 1, nums[1]).**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to the current value of `nums[1]`, which is the second element in the list `nums` (since indexing starts at 0). If `nums[1]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`, then `s` is set to 1, `e` is set to 0, and `arr` is updated to contain the tuple `(1, 1, nums[1])`. The values of `N`, `nums`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
