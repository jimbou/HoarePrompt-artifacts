Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is N.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following properties:

* The value of N remains unchanged.
* The list nums remains unchanged.
* The variable s will be set to the last index of nums where the value of nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num. This means that s will point to the last index where a new subsequence of equal integers starts.
* The variable e remains unchanged at 0.
* The variable num will be set to the last integer in the list of N integers.
* The list arr will contain tuples representing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums. Each tuple will have the form (start, end, value), where start and end are the indices of the subsequence and value is the value of the integers in the subsequence.
* The stdin will still contain the remaining test cases.
* The variable i will be set to N, indicating that the loop has executed N+1 times.
