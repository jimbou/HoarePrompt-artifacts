The code prints the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr, and the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr plus one. Where eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last assigned value, and the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr remains unchanged.
Output: **s (which is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr), e + 1 (where e is the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
