Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is N, LA is the second last index of arr. If the current value of ppp is 23, the list of N+1 integers which is nums is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, l is an integer, r is an integer, i is N, LA is the second last index of arr, nums is being printed, and stdin contains at least one remaining test case. If tc is greater than 5, the current value of tc is greater than 5. If ppp is 23, the values of l and r are being printed. Otherwise, no additional actions are performed. If s > l, if s is 1, -1 and -1 are being printed. Otherwise, the value of s-1 and the value of s are being printed, where s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num. If s is less than or equal to l, s is less than or equal to l. If e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 are being printed. If e is less than r, if e is less than N, the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num which is s and the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s plus 1 which is e+1 are being printed. If e is greater than or equal to N, (-1,-1) is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The values of N, nums, num, arr, l, r, i, LA, and stdin remain unchanged. The variable eli is assigned the index of the first occurrence of (l, 0, 0) in arr, or the length of arr if (l, 0, 0) is not found. The values of s and e are updated to the first two elements of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than N, the updated values of s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, the values -1 and -1 are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The values of N, nums, num, i, LA, and the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr remain unchanged. The variable eli is assigned the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order. The variable s is assigned the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr, and the variable e is assigned the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr. The stdin remains unchanged. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 are printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
