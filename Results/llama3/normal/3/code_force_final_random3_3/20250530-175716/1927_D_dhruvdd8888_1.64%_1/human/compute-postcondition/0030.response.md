Postcondition: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, l is an integer, r is an integer, i is N, LA is the second last index of arr, nums is being printed, and stdin contains at least one remaining test case. If tc is greater than 5, the current value of tc is greater than 5. If ppp is 23, the values of l and r are being printed. Otherwise, no additional actions are performed. The current value of s is greater than l.**
