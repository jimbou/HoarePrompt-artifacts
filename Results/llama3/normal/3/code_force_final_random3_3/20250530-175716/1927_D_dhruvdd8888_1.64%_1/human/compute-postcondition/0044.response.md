The code prints the value of `s`, which is the last index of `nums` where `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`, and the value of `e + 1`, where `e` is the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in `nums` that contains the last index `s`.

Since `s` is the last index of `nums` where `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`, it represents the starting point of the last subsequence of equal integers in `nums`. The value of `e + 1` represents the index after the end of this subsequence.

Output: **s (the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num), e + 1 (the index after the end of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s)**
