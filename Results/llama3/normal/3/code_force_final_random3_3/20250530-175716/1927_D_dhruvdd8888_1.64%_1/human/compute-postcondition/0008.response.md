Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 1. If nums[i] is not equal to the current value of num, then s is 1, e is 0, num is the current value of nums[i], and arr is a list containing the tuple (1, 1, num). Otherwise, no changes are made to s, e, num, and arr.***
