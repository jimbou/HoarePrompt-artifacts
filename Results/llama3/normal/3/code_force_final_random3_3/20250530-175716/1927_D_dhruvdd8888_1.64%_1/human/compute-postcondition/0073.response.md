Postcondition: **The values of N, nums, num, arr, l, r, i, LA, and stdin remain unchanged. The variable eli is assigned the index of the first occurrence of (l, 0, 0) in arr, or the length of arr if (l, 0, 0) is not found. The values of s and e are updated to the first two elements of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than N, the updated values of s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, the values -1 and -1 are printed.**
