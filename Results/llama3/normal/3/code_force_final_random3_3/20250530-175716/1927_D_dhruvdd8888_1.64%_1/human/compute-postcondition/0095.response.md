Postcondition: ***The values of N, nums, num, i, LA, and the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr remain unchanged. The variable eli is assigned the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order. The variable s is assigned the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr, and the variable e is assigned the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr. The stdin remains unchanged. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 are printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 are printed.***
