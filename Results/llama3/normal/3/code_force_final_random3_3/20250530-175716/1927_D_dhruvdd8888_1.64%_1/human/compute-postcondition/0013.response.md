Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 2, num is the current value of nums[2]. If nums[2] is not equal to the current value of nums[2], then s is 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing the tuples (2, 2, nums[2]) and (3, 2, nums[2]). Otherwise, the state of s, e, and arr remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be equal to `nums[2]`, which is the current value of the third element in the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition `If nums[2] is not equal to the current value of num` is always false because `num` is now equal to `nums[2]`, so the state of `s`, `e`, and `arr` remains the same as before.
