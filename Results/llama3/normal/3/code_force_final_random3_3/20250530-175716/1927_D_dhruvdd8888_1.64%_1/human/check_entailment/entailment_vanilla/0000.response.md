Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` in an array `a` such that `a_i != a_j`. The program uses a technique of grouping consecutive equal elements together and storing their start and end indices in an array `arr`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `tc` and iterating over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums` itself, and the number of queries `q`.
3.  It then initializes an empty array `arr` to store the start and end indices of consecutive equal elements in `nums`.
4.  The program iterates over `nums` and whenever it encounters a new element, it appends the start and end indices of the previous group of equal elements to `arr`.
5.  After processing `nums`, the program iterates over each query. For each query, it uses binary search to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index is greater than or equal to the query's left boundary `l`.
6.  It then checks the start and end indices of the group at index `eli` in `arr`. If the start index is greater than `l`, it means that the previous group of equal elements ends before `l`, so it prints the last element of the previous group and the first element of the current group.
7.  If the end index of the group at `eli` is greater than or equal to the query's right boundary `r`, it means that the entire range `[l, r]` is within a single group of equal elements, so it prints `-1 -1`.
8.  If the end index of the group at `eli` is less than `r` but not equal to `N` (the length of `nums`), it means that the range `[l, r]` spans across two groups of equal elements, so it prints the last element of the first group and the first element of the second group.
9.  If none of the above conditions are met, it means that the range `[l, r]` is entirely within a single group of equal elements that ends at the last index of `nums`, so it prints `-1 -1`.
