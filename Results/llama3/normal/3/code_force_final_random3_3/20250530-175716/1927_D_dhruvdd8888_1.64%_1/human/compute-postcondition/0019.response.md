Postcondition: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is N, LA is the second last index of arr. If the current value of ppp is 23, the list of N+1 integers which is nums is being printed.**
