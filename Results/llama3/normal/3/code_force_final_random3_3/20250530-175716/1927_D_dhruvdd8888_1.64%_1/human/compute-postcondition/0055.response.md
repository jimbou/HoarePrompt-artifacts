Output: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, l is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, i is N, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains at least one remaining test case, and the input to the range function is greater than 1. If tc is greater than 5, the current value of tc is greater than 5. If ppp is 23, the values of l and r are being printed. Otherwise, no additional actions are performed. If s > l, if s is 1, -1 and -1 are being printed. Otherwise, the value of s-1 and the value of s are being printed, where s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num. If s is less than or equal to l, s is less than or equal to l. If e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 are being printed. If e is less than r, if e is less than N, the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num which is s and the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s plus 1 which is e+1 are being printed. If e is greater than or equal to N, (-1,-1) is being printed. and this is printed: "l" which is the first integer from the input and "r" which is the second integer from the input**
