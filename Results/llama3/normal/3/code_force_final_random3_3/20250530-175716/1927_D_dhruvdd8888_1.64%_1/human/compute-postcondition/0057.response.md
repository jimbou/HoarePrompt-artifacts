Output State: **The program continues with the existing values of N, nums, s, e, num, arr, l, r, i, LA, and stdin, without any changes.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes made to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The values of N, nums, s, e, num, arr, l, r, i, LA, and stdin remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration.
