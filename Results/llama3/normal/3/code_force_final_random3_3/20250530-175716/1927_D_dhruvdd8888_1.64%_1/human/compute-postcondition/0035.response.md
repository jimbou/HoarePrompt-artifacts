The code prints the value of `s - 1` and `s`. Based on the precondition, `s` is the last index of `nums` where `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`. Since `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1, it is at least 2. Therefore, `s - 1` will be at least 1.

Output: **s - 1 (which is at least 1), s (which is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num and is at least 2)**
