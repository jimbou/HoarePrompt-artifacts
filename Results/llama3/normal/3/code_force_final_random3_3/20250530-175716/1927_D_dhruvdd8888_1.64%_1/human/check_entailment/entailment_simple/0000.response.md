Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by first creating a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end indices of a subsequence of equal integers in the input list. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the subsequence that contains the left boundary of the query. If the left boundary is within the subsequence, it checks if the right boundary is also within the subsequence. If it is, it prints -1 -1, indicating that there are no two different elements in the query range. If the right boundary is not within the subsequence, it prints the start index of the subsequence and the index after the end of the subsequence, which are two different elements in the query range. If the left boundary is not within the subsequence, it checks if the start index of the subsequence is 1. If it is, it prints -1 -1, indicating that there are no two different elements in the query range. If the start index is not 1, it prints the index before the start of the subsequence and the start index of the subsequence, which are two different elements in the query range.

Correctness: **True**
