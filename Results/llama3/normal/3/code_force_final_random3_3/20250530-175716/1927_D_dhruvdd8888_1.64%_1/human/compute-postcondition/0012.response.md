Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 2, num is the current value of nums[2]. If nums[2] is not equal to the current value of num, then s is 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing the tuples (2, 2, nums[2]) and (3, 2, num). Otherwise, the state of s, e, and arr remains unchanged.***
