Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 2, num is the current value of nums[2], s is 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing the tuples (2, 2, nums[2]) and (3, 2, num)**

The code modifies the values of `s` and `arr`. The first line appends a new tuple to `arr`, which now contains two tuples: `(2, 2, nums[2])` and `(3, 2, num)`. The second line assigns the value of `i` to `s`, making `s` equal to 2. The values of `N`, `nums`, `stdin`, `i`, `num`, and `e` remain unchanged.
