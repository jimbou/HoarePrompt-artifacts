Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the current value of nums[i], arr is an empty list, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 0. If nums[i] is not equal to the original value of num, then s is set to i, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of N integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + original value of s, original value of i, original value of num), stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 0, and the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the original value of num. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of num is updated to the current value of nums[i]. If nums[i] is not equal to the original value of num, then s is set to i, e is 0, num is reset to the first integer in the original list of N integers, arr is updated to contain one tuple (1 + original value of s, original value of i, original value of num), and i is reset to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to s, e, num, arr, and i. The values of N, nums, and stdin remain unchanged.
