Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a list of `N+1` integers, `s` is the last index of `nums` where `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last integer in the list of `N` integers, `arr` is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in `nums`, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `i` is `N`, `LA` is the second last index of `arr`, `ppp` is 23, `nums` is being printed, and stdin contains at least one remaining test case.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to the two integers input from stdin, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains at least one remaining test case.
