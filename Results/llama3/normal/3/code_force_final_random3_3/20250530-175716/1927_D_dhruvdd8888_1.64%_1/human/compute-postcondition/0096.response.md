Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, stdin is empty, and i is N.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the values of N, nums, num, arr, and i remain unchanged. The variable stdin is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables s and e are updated to the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num and the end index of the subsequence of equal integers in nums that contains the last index s, respectively. The loop has finished executing all the iterations, and no more test cases are left to process.
