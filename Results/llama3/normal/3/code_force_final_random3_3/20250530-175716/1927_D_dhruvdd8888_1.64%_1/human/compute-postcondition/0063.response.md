Output: **The values of N, nums, s, e, num, arr, l, r, i, LA, and stdin remain unchanged. The variable eli is assigned the index of the first occurrence of (l, 0, 0) in arr, or the length of arr if (l, 0, 0) is not found. The values of s and e are updated to the first two elements of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr, and this is printed: s - 1 and s, where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr**
