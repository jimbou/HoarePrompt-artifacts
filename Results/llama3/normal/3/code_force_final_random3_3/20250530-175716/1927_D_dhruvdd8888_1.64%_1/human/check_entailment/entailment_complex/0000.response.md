Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly groups consecutive equal integers in the list into subsequences and stores their start and end indices. For each query pair (l, r), it finds the subsequence that contains the index l and checks if the subsequence's end index is within the range [l, r]. If it is, the function prints the start and end indices of the subsequence. If not, it prints (-1, -1). The program also handles a special case where the current value of ppp is 23, in which case it prints the list of N+1 integers. After processing all queries, the function leaves the standard input empty.

Correctness: **True**
