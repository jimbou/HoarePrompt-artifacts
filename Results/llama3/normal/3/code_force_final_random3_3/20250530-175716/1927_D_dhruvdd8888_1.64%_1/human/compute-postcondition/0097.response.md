Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer N, followed by a list of N integers, and then an integer q, followed by q pairs of integers. The function groups consecutive equal integers in the list into subsequences and stores their start and end indices. For each query pair (l, r), it finds the subsequence that contains the index l and checks if the subsequence's end index is within the range [l, r]. If it is, the function prints the start and end indices of the subsequence. If not, it prints (-1, -1). The function also handles a special case where the current value of ppp is 23, in which case it prints the list of N+1 integers. After processing all queries, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
