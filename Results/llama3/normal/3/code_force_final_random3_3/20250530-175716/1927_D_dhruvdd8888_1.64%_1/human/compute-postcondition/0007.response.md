The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains three values: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. Since `s` is 0, `i` is 1, and `num` is the current value of `nums[i]`, the tuple becomes `(1, 1, num)`. The second line assigns the value of `i` to `s`, making `s` equal to 1.

Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 1, e is 0, num is the current value of nums[i], arr is a list containing the tuple (1, 1, num), stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 1**
