Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is i, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of N integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + original value of s, original value of i, original value of num), stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 0, and the current value of nums[i] is not equal to num.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the current value of `i`, which is 0. The list `arr` now contains a tuple with the values (1 + original value of `s`, original value of `i`, original value of `num`). The original values of `N`, `nums`, `e`, `num`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
