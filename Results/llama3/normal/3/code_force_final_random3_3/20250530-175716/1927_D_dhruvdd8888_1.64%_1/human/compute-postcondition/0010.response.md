The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 2, num is the current value of nums[2], if nums[2] is not equal to the current value of num, then s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing the tuple (2, 2, nums[2])**
