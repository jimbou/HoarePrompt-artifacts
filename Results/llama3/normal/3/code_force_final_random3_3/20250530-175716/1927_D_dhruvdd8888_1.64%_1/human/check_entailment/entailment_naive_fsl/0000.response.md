Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct. It uses a binary search approach to find the range of indices where the elements are the same, and then checks if the query range falls within this range. If it does, it returns the indices of the first and last elements of the range. If not, it returns -1 -1.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query range is outside the range of the array, or when the array contains only one element.

The use of binary search reduces the time complexity of the program, making it efficient for large inputs.

One potential issue could be the use of `sys.stdin.readline` instead of the built-in `input` function, but this is not a correctness issue, rather a style issue.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and efficient.
