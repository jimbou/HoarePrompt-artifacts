Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of N integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 0. If nums[i] is not equal to num, then s is set to i, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of N integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + original value of s, original value of i, original value of num), stdin contains the remaining test cases, i is 0, and the current value of nums[i] is not equal to num. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
