To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `N`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `N + 1` is at least 1, meaning `N` must be at least 0. Since `N` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be greater than or equal to 0.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we can adjust its state to be 0.

The other variables `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a list of N+1 integers, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the original list of N integers, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains the remaining test cases, `i` is 0**
