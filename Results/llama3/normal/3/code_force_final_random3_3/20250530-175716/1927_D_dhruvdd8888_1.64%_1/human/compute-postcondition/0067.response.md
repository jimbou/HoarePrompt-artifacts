The code prints the values of `s` and `e + 1`. 

`s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. 

`e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. 

`eli` is the index of the first occurrence of `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`, or the length of `arr` if `(l, 0, 0)` is not found. 

`LA` is a value that remains unchanged.

Output: **s (the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr), e + 1 (the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr plus one)**
