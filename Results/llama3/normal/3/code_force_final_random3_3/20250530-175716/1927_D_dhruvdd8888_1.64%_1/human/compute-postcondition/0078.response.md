Postcondition: **The values of N, nums, num, arr, i, LA, and eli remain unchanged. The variable l is assigned the first integer from the input, and the variable r is assigned the second integer from the input. The stdin contains the next input. The values of s and e are updated to the first two elements of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr. If ppp equals 23, the first integer from the input which is l and the second integer from the input which is r are being printed.**
