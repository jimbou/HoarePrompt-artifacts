To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the input from `stdin` and the loop variable `_`. The loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`.

State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the last index of nums where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the start and end indices of each subsequence of equal integers in nums, stdin contains at least one remaining test case, i is N, LA is the second last index of arr, ppp is 23, and nums is being printed**
