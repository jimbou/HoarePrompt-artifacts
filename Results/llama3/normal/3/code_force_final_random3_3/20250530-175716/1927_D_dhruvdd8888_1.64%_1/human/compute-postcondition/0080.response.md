Postcondition: **The values of N, nums, num, arr, i, LA, and eli remain unchanged. The variable l is assigned the first integer from the input, and the variable r is assigned the second integer from the input. The stdin contains the next input. The values of s and e are updated to the first two elements of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr. If tc is greater than 5 and ppp equals 23, the first integer from the input which is l and the second integer from the input which is r are being printed, and we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements.**
