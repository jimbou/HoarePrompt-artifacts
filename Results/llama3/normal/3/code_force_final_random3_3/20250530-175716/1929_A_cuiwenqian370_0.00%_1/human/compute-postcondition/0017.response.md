Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, left is less than or equal to right, right is less than or equal to n. If left is equal to right, new_arr contains four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[left], and arr[left]. If left is not equal to right, new_arr contains five elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], arr[left], and arr[right].**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `right` has been decremented by 1. The relationship between `left` and `right` has changed, and they are now either equal or `left` is less than or equal to `right`. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The composition of `new_arr` remains the same, but its elements may have changed due to the changes in `left` and `right`.
