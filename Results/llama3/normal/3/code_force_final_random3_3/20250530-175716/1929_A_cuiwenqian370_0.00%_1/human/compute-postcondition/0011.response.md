Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `left` is less than `n - 1` minus 1, `right` is `n - 1` plus 1. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains four elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]`.***
