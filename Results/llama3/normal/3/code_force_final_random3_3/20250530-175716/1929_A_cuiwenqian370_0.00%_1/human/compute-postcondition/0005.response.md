Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, new_arr contains two elements: arr[right] and arr[left], left is not equal to right, left is less than right**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only change is the addition of two elements to the `new_arr` list, which now contains the elements at indices `right` and `left` of the `arr` list, in that order.
