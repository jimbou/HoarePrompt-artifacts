Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is equal to `n`, `right` is equal to -1, `max_beauty` is 0**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `max_beauty` is introduced with a value of 0. The list `arr` and its reversed version `new_arr` are still related, and the values of `left` and `right` are still equal to `n` and -1, respectively.
