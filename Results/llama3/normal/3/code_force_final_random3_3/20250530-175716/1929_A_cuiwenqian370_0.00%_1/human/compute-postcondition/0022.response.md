The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is equal to `n`, `right` is equal to -1, `max_beauty` is equal to `max_beauty` plus the absolute difference between the second element of `new_arr` and the first element of `new_arr`, `i` is 2**
