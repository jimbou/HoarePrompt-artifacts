To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_arr`, `left`, `right`, and `max_beauty`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is equal to `n`, `right` is equal to -1, `max_beauty` is equal to `max_beauty` plus the absolute difference between the third element of `new_arr` and the second element of `new_arr`, `i` is 3**
