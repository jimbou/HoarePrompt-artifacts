Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, right is n - 1**

The code snippet sorts the list `arr` in ascending order, and assigns the result to the same variable `arr`. The list `new_arr` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `left` and `right` are assigned the values 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
