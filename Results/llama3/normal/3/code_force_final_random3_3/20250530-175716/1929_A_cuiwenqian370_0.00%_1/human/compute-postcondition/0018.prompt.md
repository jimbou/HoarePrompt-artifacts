Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, right is n - 1
Code of the loop:
while left <= right:
    if left == right:
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    else:
        new_arr.append(arr[right])
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    left += 1
    right -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `left` is less than `right`, `left` is `n - 1` minus 1, `right` is `n - 1` plus 1, `new_arr` contains two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, left is less than or equal to n - 1, right is less than or equal to n, new_arr contains three elements: arr[right], arr[left], and arr[left] if left is equal to right, otherwise new_arr contains four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left].
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, left is less than or equal to right, right is less than or equal to n. If left is equal to right, new_arr contains four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[left], and arr[left]. If left is not equal to right, new_arr contains five elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], arr[left], and arr[right].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
