Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program first sorts the input array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty of the array.

The program then calculates the maximum beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The use of the `abs` function ensures that the differences are always positive, which is consistent with the problem definition.

Correctness: **True**
