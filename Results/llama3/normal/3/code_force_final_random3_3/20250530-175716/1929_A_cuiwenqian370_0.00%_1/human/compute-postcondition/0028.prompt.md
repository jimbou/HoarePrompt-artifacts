You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0.
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, new_arr contains all elements of arr in reverse order, left is equal to n, right is equal to -1.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is equal to `n`, `right` is equal to -1, `max_beauty` is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns max_beauty which is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in new_arr, where new_arr contains all elements of arr in reverse order, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, and n is an integer greater than 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns max_beauty which is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in new_arr, where new_arr contains all elements of arr in reverse order, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, and n is an integer greater than 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
