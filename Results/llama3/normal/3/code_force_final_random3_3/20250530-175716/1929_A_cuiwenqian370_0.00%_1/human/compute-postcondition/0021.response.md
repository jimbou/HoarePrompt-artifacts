Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is equal to `n`, `right` is equal to -1, `max_beauty` is equal to `max_beauty` plus the absolute difference between the second element of `new_arr` and the first element of `new_arr`, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `max_beauty` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between the second element of `new_arr` and the first element of `new_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
