According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is `n - 1` minus 1, and `right` is `n - 1` plus 1. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, `n - 1` is at least 1, so `left` is at least 0 and `right` is at least 2. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so we need to adjust the state of `left` and `right` to make sure that `left` is less than or equal to `right`. We can do this by adjusting `left` to be less than `right`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `left` is less than `right`, `left` is less than `n - 1` minus 1, `right` is `n - 1` plus 1, `new_arr` contains two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.**
