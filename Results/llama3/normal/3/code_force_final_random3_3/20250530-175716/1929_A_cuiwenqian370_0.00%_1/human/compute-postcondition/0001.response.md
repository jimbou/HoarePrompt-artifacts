To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `left <= right`. Given the initial states:

- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is `n - 1`.

The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, and knowing that `n` is greater than 1, it is already guaranteed that `left` is less than `right` (since 0 is less than any positive number minus one). Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`.**
