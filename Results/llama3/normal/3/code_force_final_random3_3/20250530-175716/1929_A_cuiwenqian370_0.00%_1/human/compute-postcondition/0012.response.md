Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, left is less than or equal to n - 1, right is less than or equal to n, new_arr contains three elements: arr[right], arr[left], and arr[left] if left is equal to right, otherwise new_arr contains four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left].**

The code increments `left` by 1 and decrements `right` by 1. This means that `left` is now less than or equal to `n - 1`, and `right` is less than or equal to `n`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and the integers in `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `new_arr` depends on the new values of `left` and `right`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains four elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]`.
