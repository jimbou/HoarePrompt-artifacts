Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program sorts the array in ascending order, then creates a new array by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array, which represents the maximum beauty of the original array.

The program's approach is correct because it takes advantage of the fact that the maximum beauty of an array is achieved when the elements are arranged in a way that maximizes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. By alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements, the program ensures that the sum of the absolute differences is maximized.

The program's implementation is also correct. It correctly sorts the array, creates the new array, and calculates the sum of the absolute differences. The use of the `abs` function ensures that the differences are always positive, which is necessary for calculating the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
