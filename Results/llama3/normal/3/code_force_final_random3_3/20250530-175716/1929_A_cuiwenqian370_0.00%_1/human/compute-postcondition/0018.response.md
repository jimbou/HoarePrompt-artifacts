Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, new_arr contains all elements of arr in reverse order, left is equal to n, right is equal to -1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains an integer greater than 1, the variable `arr` remains a sorted list of `n` integers, and all integers in `arr` remain greater than 0. The variable `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order. The variable `left` is equal to `n`, and the variable `right` is equal to -1.
