Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr` and `left` is equal to `right` and both are `n - 1`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`, and `left` is less than `right`.***
