Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, left is less than right, right is less than or equal to n, new_arr contains five elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], arr[left], and arr[right] if left is equal to right, otherwise new_arr contains six elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only change occurs in the `new_arr` list, which initially contained three or four elements depending on whether `left` is equal to `right`. After executing the code, two more elements are appended to `new_arr`: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` now contains five elements, with `arr[right]` appearing three times and `arr[left]` appearing twice. If `left` is not equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains six elements, with `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` each appearing three times.
