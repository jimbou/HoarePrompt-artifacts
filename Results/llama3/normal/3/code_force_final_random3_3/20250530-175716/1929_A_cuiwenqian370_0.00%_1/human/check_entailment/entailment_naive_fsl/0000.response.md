Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order and then rearranges the elements in a way that maximizes the beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is calculated by summing the absolute differences between adjacent elements.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array has an odd number of elements, the middle element is placed at the end of the new array.
* When the array has an even number of elements, the elements are alternately placed at the beginning and end of the new array.
* When all elements in the array are the same, the beauty of the array is 0.
* When the array has only two elements, the beauty of the array is the absolute difference between the two elements.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input array is empty or has only one element.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array and handles all possible cases correctly.
