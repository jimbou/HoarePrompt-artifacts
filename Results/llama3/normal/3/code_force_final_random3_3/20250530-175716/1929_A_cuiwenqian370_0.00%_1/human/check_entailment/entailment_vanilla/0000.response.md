Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by first sorting the array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array. Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement does not require the array to be rearranged in a specific way, but rather to find the maximum possible beauty. The given program's approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty, as it only considers one possible rearrangement.

A correct approach would be to simply sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the maximum beauty is achieved when the largest element is placed at the end of the array and the smallest element is placed at the beginning, with the remaining elements in ascending order.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
