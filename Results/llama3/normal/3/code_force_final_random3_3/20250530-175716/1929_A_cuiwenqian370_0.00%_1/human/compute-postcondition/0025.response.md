Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is equal to `n`, `right` is equal to -1, `max_beauty` is equal to `max_beauty` plus the absolute difference between the fourth element of `new_arr` and the third element of `new_arr`, `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max_beauty` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between the fourth element of `new_arr` and the third element of `new_arr` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
