Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `left` is equal to `right` and both are `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `new_arr` has been updated to include the last element of `arr`, which is the element at index `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
