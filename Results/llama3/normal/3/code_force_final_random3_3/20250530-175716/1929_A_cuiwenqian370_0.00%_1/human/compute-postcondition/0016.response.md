Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `left` is less than `right`, `right` is less than or equal to `n`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains four elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`. If `left` is not equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains five elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[right]`.***
