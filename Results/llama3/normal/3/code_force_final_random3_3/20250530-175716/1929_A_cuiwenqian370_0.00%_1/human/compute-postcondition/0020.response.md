According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than 1, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, `n` does not need to be adjusted. The variable `i` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to be equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is equal to `n`, `right` is equal to -1, `max_beauty` is 0, `i` is 1**
