Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `left` is less than `right`, `right` is less than or equal to `n`, `new_arr` contains either five elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]` if `left` is not equal to `right`, otherwise `new_arr` contains four elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and the list `arr` remain unchanged. The values of `left` and `right` also remain the same. However, the list `new_arr` has been modified by appending an additional element, which is `arr[left]`. If `left` is not equal to `right`, `new_arr` now contains five elements, otherwise, it contains four elements.
