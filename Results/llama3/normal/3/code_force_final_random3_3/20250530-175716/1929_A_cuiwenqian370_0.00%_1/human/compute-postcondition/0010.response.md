Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a sorted list of n integers, all integers in arr are greater than 0, left is less than n - 1 minus 1, right is n - 1 plus 1, new_arr contains four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left].**

The code appends the elements at the `right` and `left` indices of `arr` to `new_arr` twice. Since `new_arr` initially contains two elements (`arr[right]` and `arr[left]`), after the code executes, it will contain these two elements repeated, resulting in a total of four elements. The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
