Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `left` is less than `right`, `left` is `n - 1` minus 1, `right` is `n - 1` plus 1, `new_arr` contains two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `arr` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `left` and `right` are updated by the code. The value of `left` is incremented by 1, and the value of `right` is decremented by 1. As a result, `left` is now `n - 1` minus 1, and `right` is now `n - 1` plus 1. The list `new_arr` contains two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.
