Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `left` is less than `right`, `left` is less than `n - 1` minus 1, `right` is `n - 1` plus 1, `new_arr` contains three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`.**

In this output state, the value of `new_arr` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `arr[left]`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original properties and relationships.
