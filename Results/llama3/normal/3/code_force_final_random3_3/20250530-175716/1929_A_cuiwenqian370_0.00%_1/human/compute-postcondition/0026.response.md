Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` is equal to `n`, `right` is equal to -1, `max_beauty` is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variables `n`, `arr`, `new_arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `max_beauty` has been updated to be the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`, and the loop counter `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`.
