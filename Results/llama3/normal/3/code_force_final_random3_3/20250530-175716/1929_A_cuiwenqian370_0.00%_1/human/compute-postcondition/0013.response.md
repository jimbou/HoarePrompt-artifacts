To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `left` and `right` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `left` is less than or equal to `right`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than or equal to `n - 1` and `right` is less than or equal to `n`. To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `left` to be less than `right`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, all integers in `arr` are greater than 0, `left` is less than `right`, `right` is less than or equal to `n`, `new_arr` contains three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]` if `left` is equal to `right`, otherwise `new_arr` contains four elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]`.**
