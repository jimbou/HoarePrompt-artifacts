Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin is empty, _ is equal to t, n, m, k are integers, a and b are lists of integers with lengths len_a and len_b respectively, where at least one of len_a or len_b is at least 1. d is the integer division of k by 2. count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus the number of iterations of the loop where len_a is greater than i + 1 and a[i] is less than or equal to k. count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus the number of iterations of the loop where len_b is greater than i + 1 and b[i] is less than or equal to k, and 'YES' is printed if count_a is greater than or equal to d and count_b is greater than or equal to d, otherwise 'NO' is printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input has been fully processed, and the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, and `d` have been updated according to the last iteration of the loop. The counts `count_a` and `count_b` have been accumulated over all iterations, and the final output is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the conditions `count_a >= d` and `count_b >= d` are met.
