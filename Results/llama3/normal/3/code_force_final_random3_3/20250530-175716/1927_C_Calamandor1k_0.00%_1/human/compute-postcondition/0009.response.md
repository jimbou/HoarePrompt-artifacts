Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1 or `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. The current value of `len_a` is greater than `i` + 1. The current value of `len_b` is greater than `i` + 1.***
