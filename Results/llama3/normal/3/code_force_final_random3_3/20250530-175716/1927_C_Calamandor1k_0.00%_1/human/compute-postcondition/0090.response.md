Output: **n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers with length len_a ≥ 1, b is a list of integers with length len_b ≥ 1, d is the integer division of k by 2. count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus the number of iterations of the loop where len_a is greater than i + 1 and a[i] is less than or equal to k. count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus the number of iterations of the loop where len_b is greater than i + 1 and b[i] is less than or equal to k, and 'YES' is printed if count_a is greater than or equal to d and count_b is greater than or equal to d, otherwise 'NO' is printed**
