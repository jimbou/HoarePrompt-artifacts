Output: **n, m, k are integers, a and b are lists of integers with lengths len_a and len_b respectively, where at least one of len_a or len_b is at least 1. d is the integer division of k by 2, t is a positive integer greater than 1, and _ is 1. count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k, and count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k. The code prints 'YES' if both count_a and count_b are greater than or equal to d, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
