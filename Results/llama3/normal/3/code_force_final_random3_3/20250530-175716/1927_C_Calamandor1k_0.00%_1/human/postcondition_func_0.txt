This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second and third lines contain n and m integers, respectively. It then checks if at least half of the elements in both lists are less than or equal to k, and prints 'YES' if this condition is met for both lists, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
