Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers with length `len_a` ≥ 1, `b` is a list of integers with length `len_b` ≥ 1, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `i` is 0. The current value of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`**
