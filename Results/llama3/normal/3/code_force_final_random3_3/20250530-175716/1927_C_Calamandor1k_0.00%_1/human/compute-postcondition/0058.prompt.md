Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a, len_b is the length of b, d is the integer division of k by 2, count_a is 0, count_b is 0, t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, i is equal to the maximum of len_a and len_b, stdin contains 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
    if len_a > i + 1:
        if a[i] <= k:
            count_a += 1
    if len_b > i + 1:
        if b[i] <= k:
            count_b += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers with lengths `len_a` and `len_b` respectively, where at least one of `len_a` or `len_b` is at least 1. `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `_` is 1. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 1. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is 1, otherwise `count_b` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count_a` and `count_b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers with lengths `len_a` and `len_b` respectively, where at least one of `len_a` or `len_b` is at least 1. `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `_` is 1. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 2. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is 2 if `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, otherwise `count_b` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count_a` and `count_b`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `k`, then `count_a` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers with lengths `len_a` and `len_b` respectively, where at least one of `len_a` or `len_b` is at least 2. `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `_` is 1. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 3 if `a[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` is 2. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 2`, then `count_b` is 2 if `b[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_b` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count_a` and `count_b`. `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `k`, then if `len_a` is greater than `i + 2`, `count_a` is 2 if `a[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` is 1. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 2`, then `count_b` is 2 if `b[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_b` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count_a` and `count_b`. `i` is `i + 1`. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_b` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
