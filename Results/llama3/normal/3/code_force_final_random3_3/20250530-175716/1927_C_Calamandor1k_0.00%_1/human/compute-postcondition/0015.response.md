Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 2, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 2, `count_a` is 2 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 1, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count_a` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is now 2, otherwise it remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
