Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers with lengths `len_a` and `len_b` respectively, where at least one of `len_a` or `len_b` is at least 1. `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 0, where `i` is the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b` and is at least 1. The current value of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count_a` and `count_b`.**
