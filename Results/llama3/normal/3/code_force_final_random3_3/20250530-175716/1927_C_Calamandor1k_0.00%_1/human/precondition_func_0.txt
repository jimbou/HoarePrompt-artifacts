stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n and m are the lengths of arrays a and b respectively, and k is an even number. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the elements of array a. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, representing the elements of array b. All integers in the input are non-negative and less than or equal to 10^6.
