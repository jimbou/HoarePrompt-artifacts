#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n and m are the lengths of arrays a and b respectively, and k is an even number. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the elements of array a. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, representing the elements of array b. All integers in the input are non-negative and less than or equal to 10^6.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is a positive integer, stdin is empty, _ is equal to t, n, m, k are integers, a and b are lists of integers with lengths len_a and len_b respectively, where at least one of len_a or len_b is at least 1. d is the integer division of k by 2. count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus the number of iterations of the loop where len_a is greater than i + 1 and a[i] is less than or equal to k. count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus the number of iterations of the loop where len_b is greater than i + 1 and b[i] is less than or equal to k, and 'YES' is printed if count_a is greater than or equal to d and count_b is greater than or equal to d, otherwise 'NO' is printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second and third lines contain n and m integers, respectively. It then checks if at least half of the elements in both lists are less than or equal to k, and prints 'YES' if this condition is met for both lists, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
