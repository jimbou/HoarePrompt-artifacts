Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1 or `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is equal to the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b` and must be at least 1, stdin contains 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`.**
