Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n and m are the lengths of arrays a and b respectively, and k is an even number. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the elements of array a. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, representing the elements of array b. All integers in the input are non-negative and less than or equal to 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
    count_a, count_b = 0, 0
    d = k // 2
    for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
        if len_a > i + 1:
            if a[i] <= k:
                count_a += 1
        if len_b > i + 1:
            if b[i] <= k:
                count_b += 1
    print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b`. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and 'YES' is printed if `count_a` is greater than or equal to `d` and `count_b` is greater than or equal to `d`, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, m, k are integers, a and b are lists of integers with lengths len_a and len_b respectively, where at least one of len_a or len_b is at least 1. d is the integer division of k by 2, t is a positive integer greater than 1, and _ is 1. count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k, and count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k. The code prints 'YES' if both count_a and count_b are greater than or equal to d, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers with length len_a ≥ 1, b is a list of integers with length len_b ≥ 1, d is the integer division of k by 2. count_a is the number of elements in a that are less than or equal to k plus the number of iterations of the loop where len_a is greater than i + 1 and a[i] is less than or equal to k. count_b is the number of elements in b that are less than or equal to k plus the number of iterations of the loop where len_b is greater than i + 1 and b[i] is less than or equal to k, and 'YES' is printed if count_a is greater than or equal to d and count_b is greater than or equal to d, otherwise 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
