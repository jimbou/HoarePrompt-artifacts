Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, len_a is the length of a, len_b is the length of b, count_a is 0, count_b is 0, d is the integer division of k by 2, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
    if len_a > i + 1:
        if a[i] <= k:
            count_a += 1
    if len_b > i + 1:
        if b[i] <= k:
            count_b += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 1 or `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. The current value of `len_a` is greater than `i` + 1. If `len_b` is greater than `i` + 1, then `count_b` is 1 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_b` is 0. Otherwise, `count_b` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 2, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 2, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If `len_b` is greater than `i` + 1, then if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is increased by 1. If `len_a` is greater than `i` + 1, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 2. Otherwise, `count_a` is 1. If `len_a` is not greater than `i` + 1, no changes are made. If `len_b` is not greater than `i` + 1, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 2, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 2, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `len_b` is greater than `i` + 1 and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is increased by 1. `count_a` is 1 if `len_a` is not greater than `i` + 1, 2 if `len_a` is greater than `i` + 1 and `a[i]` is greater than `k`, and 3 if `len_a` is greater than `i` + 1 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
