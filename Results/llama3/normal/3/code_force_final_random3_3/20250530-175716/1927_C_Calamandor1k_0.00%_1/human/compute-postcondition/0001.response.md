To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range it's iterating over, which is `t`).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0.

The loop variable `_` will take on the values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution. So, at the start of the loop, `_` should be 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
