Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b`. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and 'YES' is printed if `count_a` is greater than or equal to `d` and `count_b` is greater than or equal to `d`, otherwise 'NO' is printed**
