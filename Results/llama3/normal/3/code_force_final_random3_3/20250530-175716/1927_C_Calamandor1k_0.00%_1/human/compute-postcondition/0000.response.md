Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where n and m are the lengths of arrays a and b respectively, and k is an even number. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the elements of array a. The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, representing the elements of array b. All integers in the input are non-negative and less than or equal to 10^6.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of three lines as described in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected.
