Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 2, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 2, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `len_b` is greater than `i` + 1, then if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is increased by 1. If `len_a` is greater than `i` + 1, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 3. Otherwise, `count_a` is 2. If `len_a` is not greater than `i` + 1, no changes are made. If `len_b` is not greater than `i` + 1, no changes are made.***
