Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be at least 2, `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be at least 2, `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is increased by 1. `count_a` is either 1, 2 or 3 depending on the values of `len_a`, `i` and `a[i]`.***
