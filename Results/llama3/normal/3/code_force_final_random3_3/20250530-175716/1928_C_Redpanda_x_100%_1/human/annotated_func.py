#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `n` greater than 1 as input and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. The function first calculates the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, storing them in a dictionary. It then converts the dictionary keys (prime factors) into a list and iterates over the list, yielding each prime factor. The function does not modify the input `n` and only uses it to calculate the prime factors. The final state of the program is that the generator has yielded all prime factors of `n`, and the dictionary `factors` contains the prime factors and their powers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: primes is a list of prime numbers and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes).

    #State: *primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes). If k is equal to the length of primes, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function yields the product of the last factor in rest and prime_to_i (which is the product of the original prime_to_i and the kth prime number in primes to the power of factors[prime] + 1) for factors[prime] + 1 times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates all possible products of prime factors for a given list of primes and their corresponding powers, yielding each product for a specified number of times based on the powers of the primes. If the input index k is equal to the length of the primes list, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it yields the product of the last factor and the prime raised to the power of its corresponding factor plus one, for a number of times equal to the factor plus one.
