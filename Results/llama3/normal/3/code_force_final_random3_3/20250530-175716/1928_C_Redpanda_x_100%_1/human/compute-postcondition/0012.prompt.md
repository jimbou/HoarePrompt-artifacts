Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `factors` is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is a list of factors with at least one element, `prime` is the kth prime number in primes, `factor` is the first factor in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
    yield factor * prime_to_i
    prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a list of factors with at least one element, prime is the kth prime number in primes, factor is the first factor in rest, prime_to_i is prime, and factors[prime] is at least 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a list of factors with at least one element, prime is the kth prime number in primes, factor is the first factor in rest, prime_to_i is prime squared, and factors[prime] is at least 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a list of factors with at least one element, prime is the kth prime number in primes, factor is the first factor in rest, prime_to_i is prime cubed, and factors[prime] is at least 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
