Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints, but the program does not correctly calculate this number.

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly handle the case when n is not a multiple of 2k-2. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the number of different k that fit under the given constraints.

For example, if n = 10 and x = 3, the program will not correctly calculate the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. The correct answer is 2 (k = 3 and k = 5), but the program will not return this answer.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
