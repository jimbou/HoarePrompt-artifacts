Functionality: **Generates all possible products of prime factors for a given list of primes and their corresponding powers, yielding each product for a specified number of times based on the powers of the primes. If the input index k is equal to the length of the primes list, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it yields the product of the last factor and the prime raised to the power of its corresponding factor plus one, for a number of times equal to the factor plus one.**
