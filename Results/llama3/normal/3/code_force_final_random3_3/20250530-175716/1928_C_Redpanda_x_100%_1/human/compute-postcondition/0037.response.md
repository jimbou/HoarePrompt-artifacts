State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, `factors` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, where if `nn` is greater than 1, `factors[nn]` is 1 more than its previous value, `nn` is greater than 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, `primes` is a list of prime factors of `n`, `factor` has been returned with the value generated by `generate(2)`, and the value of `factor` has been yielded**
