To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`. The loop will execute as long as `factors[prime]` is at least 0.

State: **primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a list of factors with at least 2 elements, prime is the kth prime number in primes, factor is the second factor in rest, and prime_to_i is 1, and factors[prime] is at least 0**
