Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1.
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, `factors` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, `nn` is 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the square root of `n`.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, `factors` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, where if `nn` is greater than 1, `factors[nn]` is 1 more than its previous value, `nn` is greater than 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the square root of `n`.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, `factors` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, where if `nn` is greater than 1, `factors[nn]` is 1 more than its previous value, `nn` is greater than 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, `primes` is a list of prime factors of `n`, and the value of `factor` has been returned with the value generated by `generate(k)` and has been yielded, where `k` is the number of iterations of the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `n` greater than 1 as input and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. The function first calculates the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, storing them in a dictionary. It then converts the dictionary keys (prime factors) into a list and iterates over the list, yielding each prime factor. The function does not modify the input `n` and only uses it to calculate the prime factors. The final state of the program is that the generator has yielded all prime factors of `n`, and the dictionary `factors` contains the prime factors and their powers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primes is a list of prime numbers and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes).
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is an empty list, prime is the kth prime number in primes, factor is the last factor in rest, prime_to_i is the product of the original prime_to_i and prime to the power of factors[prime] + 1, and the program has yielded the product of factor and prime_to_i for factors[prime] + 1 times.
    #State: *primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes). If k is equal to the length of primes, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function yields the product of the last factor in rest and prime_to_i (which is the product of the original prime_to_i and the kth prime number in primes to the power of factors[prime] + 1) for factors[prime] + 1 times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates all possible products of prime factors for a given list of primes and their corresponding powers, yielding each product for a specified number of times based on the powers of the primes. If the input index k is equal to the length of the primes list, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it yields the product of the last factor and the prime raised to the power of its corresponding factor plus one, for a number of times equal to the factor plus one.
