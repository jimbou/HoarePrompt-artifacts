Functionality: **This function takes a positive integer `n` greater than 1 as input and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. The function first calculates the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, storing them in a dictionary. It then converts the dictionary keys (prime factors) into a list and iterates over the list, yielding each prime factor. The function does not modify the input `n` and only uses it to calculate the prime factors. The final state of the program is that the generator has yielded all prime factors of `n`, and the dictionary `factors` contains the prime factors and their powers.**
