Postcondition: ***primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes). If k is equal to the length of primes, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function yields the product of the last factor in rest and prime_to_i (which is the product of the original prime_to_i and the kth prime number in primes to the power of factors[prime] + 1) for factors[prime] + 1 times.***
