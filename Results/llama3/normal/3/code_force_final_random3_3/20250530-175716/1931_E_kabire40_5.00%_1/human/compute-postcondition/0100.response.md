Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, x is the second string in the list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the second string in operational_list. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the second string in the list plus the second string in the list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the second string in operational_list.***
