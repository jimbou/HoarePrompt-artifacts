Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_res is a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, x is the last string in the original operational_list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of x.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. If x is even, x is an even number and rev_res has been appended with the string representation of the integer value of the element at index x in rev_val. If x is odd, x is not 0 and is an odd number.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse and must have at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, plus the string representation of the integer value of the element at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list, x is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse and must have at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, plus the string representation of the integer value of the element at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list, x is 3. If x is even, val_in is the integer value of the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val. If x is odd, val_in is the value of rev_val at index x and rev_res has been appended with the reverse of val_in.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
