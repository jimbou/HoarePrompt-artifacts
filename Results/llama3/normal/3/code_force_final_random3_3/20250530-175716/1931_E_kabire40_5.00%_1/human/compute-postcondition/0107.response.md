Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, x is the last string in the initial operational_list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list. Either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed depending on the value of rev_res and max_power.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `rev_val` is now sorted in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for printing 'Sasha' or 'Anna' still depend on the values of `rev_res` and `max_power`.
