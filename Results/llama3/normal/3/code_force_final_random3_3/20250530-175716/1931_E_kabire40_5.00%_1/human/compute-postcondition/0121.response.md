Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse. If x is even, the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list is x_rev and x is 2. If x is odd, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse plus the reverse of the string at index x of rev_val, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list, and x is 2.***
