Output State: **y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse plus the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list, x is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending the reverse of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
