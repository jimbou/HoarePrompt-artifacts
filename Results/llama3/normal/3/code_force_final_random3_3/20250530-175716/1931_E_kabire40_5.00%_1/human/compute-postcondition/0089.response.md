According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the operational_list. If the list has at least 1 string the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, rev_val is a list of strings containing the reverse of the second input, rev_res is a string containing the reverse of the last string in operational_list, x is the last string in operational_list, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in operational_list, and either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed depending on the value of rev_res and max_power. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 string and the x is the first string in the list.
State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, x is the first string in the list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is an empty string, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in operational_list**
