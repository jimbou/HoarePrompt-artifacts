Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_val is a list that has been populated with values, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val. The current value of rev_res is higher than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power.***
