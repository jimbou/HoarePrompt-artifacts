Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, x is the second string in the list, rev_val is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the second string in operational_list, rev_res is the second string in the list plus the second string in the list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the second string in operational_list.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated to be the concatenation of its original value (which was either an empty string or the second string in the list) and the value of `x` (which is the second string in the list). The other variables remain unchanged.
