Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, x is the first string in the list, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the first string in operational_list, rev_res is an empty string, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the first string in operational_list. The length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of x**

In natural language, the output state is: The stdin remains empty. The values of y, list_len, max_power, operational_list, x, and x_rev remain unchanged. The rev_val list now contains the reverse of the first string in operational_list. The rev_res string remains empty.
