Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and m, and the second line contains n integers. The function processes these integers by reversing them and checking if the reversed integer has the same length as the original. If it does, the original integer is appended to the result string. If it doesn't, the reversed integer is appended to a separate list. The list is then sorted, and the integers at even indices are appended to the result string as integers, while the integers at odd indices are appended as strings. Finally, the function compares the result string to 10 raised to the power of m and prints 'Sasha' if the result string is greater, and 'Anna' otherwise. The function repeats this process for each test case and empties the standard input.**
