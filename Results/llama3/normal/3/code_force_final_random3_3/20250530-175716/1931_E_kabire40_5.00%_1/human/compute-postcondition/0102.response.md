Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 2, `list_len` is an integer equal to the first input value, `max_power` is an integer equal to the second input value, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `x` is the third string in the list, `x_rev` is an integer equal to the reverse of the third string in the list converted to an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `stdin`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still the third string in the list, but a new variable `x_rev` is introduced, which is an integer equal to the reverse of the third string in the list converted to an integer.
