Output State: **y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from operational_list that do not have the same length as their reverse and has at least two elements, x is 2. rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse and the reverse of the 2nd element of rev_val, val_in is the reverse of the 2nd element of rev_val.**

In this output state, the value of y remains unchanged as 0. The values of list_len and max_power also remain the same as they were not modified by the code. The operational_list remains a list with at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse. The rev_val list remains sorted and contains the reverse of all elements from operational_list that do not have the same length as their reverse, with at least two elements. The value of x remains 2. The rev_res string now contains all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, and the reverse of the 2nd element of rev_val. The val_in variable now holds the reverse of the 2nd element of rev_val.
