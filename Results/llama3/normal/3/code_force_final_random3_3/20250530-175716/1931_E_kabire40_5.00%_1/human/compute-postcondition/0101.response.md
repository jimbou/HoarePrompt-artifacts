To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `operational_list`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second string in the list, and `operational_list` has at least 2 strings. For the loop to execute again, `operational_list` must have at least 3 strings.

So, we adjust the states as follows:

* `x` becomes the third string in the list.
* `operational_list` must have at least 3 strings.

The other variables (`stdin`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `x_rev`, and `rev_res` or `rev_val`) are not in the loop head, so their states do not change.

State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 2, `list_len` is an integer equal to the first input value, `max_power` is an integer equal to the second input value, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `x` is the third string in the list**
