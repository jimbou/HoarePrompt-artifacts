Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, x is the first string in the list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is an empty string, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the first string in operational_list**

The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the first string `x` in the `operational_list` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `x_rev`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `operational_list` still has at least one string, and `x` is still the first string in the list. The stdin is still empty.
