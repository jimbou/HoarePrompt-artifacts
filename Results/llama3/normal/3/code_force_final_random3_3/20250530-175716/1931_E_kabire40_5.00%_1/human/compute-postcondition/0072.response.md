Output State: **y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse and must have at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, and the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list, x is 2.**

In this output state, the value of y remains unchanged as 1. The list_len and max_power variables also retain their initial values as integers. The operational_list remains empty. The rev_val list still contains the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse and must have at least 2 elements, but its elements are now used to update rev_res. The rev_res string now includes all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, and the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val. The x_rev variable still holds the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. The value of x is now 2.
