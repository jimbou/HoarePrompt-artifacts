Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val. If the current value of rev_res is higher than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power, 'Sasha' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the first string in operational_list if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the list is not equal to the length of the first string in the list, otherwise rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, plus the first string in the list if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the list is equal to the length of the first string in the list, x is the first string in the list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of x

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the first string in `operational_list` if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the list is not equal to the length of the first string in the list, otherwise `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in `rev_val` and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in `rev_val`, plus the first string in the list if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the list is equal to the length of the first string in the list, `x` is the second string in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of the reverse of `x` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` also includes the second string in the list. Otherwise, `rev_val` has an additional element which is the reverse of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the first string in `operational_list` if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the list is not equal to the length of the first string in the list, otherwise `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in `rev_val` and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in `rev_val`, plus the first string in the list if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the list is equal to the length of the first string in the list. `x` is the third string in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of the reverse of `x` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` also includes the third string in the list. Otherwise, `rev_val` has an additional element which is the reverse of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
