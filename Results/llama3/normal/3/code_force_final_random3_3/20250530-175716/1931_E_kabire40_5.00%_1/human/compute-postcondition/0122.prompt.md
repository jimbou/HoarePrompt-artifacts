Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, x is the last string in the initial operational_list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list. Either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed depending on the value of rev_res and max_power.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list. If x is even, x is 0 and rev_res is appended with the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of the first string in rev_val. If x is odd, x is 1 and rev_res is appended with the reverse of the string at index 1 of rev_val.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list, x is 1. If x is even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If x is odd, rev_res is updated to include the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse. If x is even, the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list is x_rev and x is 2. If x is odd, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse plus the reverse of the string at index x of rev_val, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list, and x is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
