Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from operational_list that do not have the same length as their reverse and has at least two elements, x is 1. rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse. If x is even, the value of the xth element of rev_val is added to rev_res. If x is odd, the reverse of the xth element of rev_val is added to rev_res and val_in is the xth element of rev_val.***
