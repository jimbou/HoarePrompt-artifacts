Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string value of the second element in `operational_list` and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the second element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the second element in `operational_list` and `rev_res` is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `rev_val` now contains the reverse of the second element in `operational_list` regardless of whether the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x` or not.
