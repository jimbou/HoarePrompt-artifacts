Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` is an integer, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the first string in `operational_list` if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the list is not equal to the length of the first string in the list, otherwise `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in `rev_val` and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in `rev_val`, plus the first string in the list if the length of the string representation of the reverse of the first string in the list is equal to the length of the first string in the list. `x` is the third string in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of the reverse of `x` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` also includes the third string in the list. Otherwise, `rev_val` has an additional element which is the reverse of `x`.***
