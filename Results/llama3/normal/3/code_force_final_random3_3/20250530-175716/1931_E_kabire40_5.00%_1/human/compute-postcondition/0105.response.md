Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `y` is 2, `list_len` is an integer equal to the first input value, `max_power` is an integer equal to the second input value, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `x` is the third string in the list, `x_rev` is an integer equal to the reverse of the third string in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is increased by the value of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list that contains the reverse of the third string in the list.***
