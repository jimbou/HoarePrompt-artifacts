The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and rev_val, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and rev_val. If x is less than the length of rev_val, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 1, rev_val has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, x must be increased by 1 and rev_val must have at least 2 elements.
State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list, x is 2**
