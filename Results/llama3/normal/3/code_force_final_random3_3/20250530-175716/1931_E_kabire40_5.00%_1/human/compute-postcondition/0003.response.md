Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`**

In this output state, the value of `x_rev` is calculated by reversing the string `x` and converting it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The `x_rev` variable now holds the integer value of the reversed string `x`.
