To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `rev_val`. The loop will execute if `rev_val` has at least one element. Since `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length as their reverse, we need to adjust the state of `operational_list` to ensure it has at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse.

State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` that have the same length as their reverse, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length as their reverse and has at least one element, `x` is 0**
