Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse and the value of the xth element of rev_val, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from operational_list that do not have the same length as their reverse and has at least one element, x is an even number.**

In this output state, the values of stdin, y, list_len, max_power, operational_list, and x remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of rev_res is updated by appending the value of the xth element of rev_val to it. The value of rev_val remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
