Output State: **y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, x is 1, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse and the reverse of the string at index 1 of rev_val, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of the string at index 1 of rev_val to val_in. Since rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 1 element, val_in becomes the reverse of the string at index 1 of rev_val. The second line appends the reverse of val_in to rev_res. Since rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, rev_res now contains the reverse of the string at index 1 of rev_val. No other variables are affected.
