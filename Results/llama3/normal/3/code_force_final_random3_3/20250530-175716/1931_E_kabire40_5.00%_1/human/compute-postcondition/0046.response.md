Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, x is the first string in the list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of x.**

In this output state, the value of x_rev is calculated by reversing the string x and converting it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
