Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is a list of strings containing the second input, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is an empty string, x is -1, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in operational_list, and either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed depending on the value of rev_res and max_power.**

Explanation:

The first line of the code snippet clears the rev_val list, which was previously a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse. The second line clears the rev_res string, which was previously a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val.

The third line takes two input values from stdin and assigns them to list_len and max_power, respectively. The fourth line takes a list of strings from stdin and assigns it to operational_list.

The value of x is now -1 because rev_val is an empty list. The value of x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in operational_list.

Finally, the code checks the value of rev_res and max_power. If the current value of rev_res is greater than 10 raised to the power of max_power, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, if the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list is less than or equal to 10 to the power of the integer value of max_power, 'Anna' is printed.
