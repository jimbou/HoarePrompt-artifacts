Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` that have the same length as their reverse, and `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length as their reverse.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code sorts the list `rev_val` in ascending order, but since `operational_list` is empty, `rev_val` remains empty. The other variables remain unchanged.
