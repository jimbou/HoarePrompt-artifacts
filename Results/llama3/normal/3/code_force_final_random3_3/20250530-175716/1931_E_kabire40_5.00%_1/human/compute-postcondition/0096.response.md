The only variable in the loop head is variable x and list operational_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the operational_list.  If the list has at least 2 strings the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, operational_list has at least 1 string, x is the first string in the list, rev_val is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the first string in operational_list, rev_res is either an empty string or the first string in the list, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the first string in operational_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 strings and the x is the second string in the list. rev_val is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the second string in operational_list, rev_res is either an empty string or the second string in the list, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the second string in operational_list. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the second string in the list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the second string in operational_list.
State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, x is the second string in the list, rev_val is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the second string in operational_list, rev_res is either an empty string or the second string in the list, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the second string in operational_list. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the second string in the list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the second string in operational_list.**
