Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. If x is even, x is an even number and rev_res has been appended with the string representation of the integer value of the element at index x in rev_val. If x is odd, x is not 0 and is an odd number.***
