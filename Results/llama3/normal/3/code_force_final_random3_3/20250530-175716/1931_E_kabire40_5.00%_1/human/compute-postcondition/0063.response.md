Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_res is a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, x is the last string in the original operational_list, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of x.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `rev_val` is now sorted in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state.
