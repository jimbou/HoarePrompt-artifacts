Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_val is a list, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val. If the current value of rev_res is higher than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power, 'Sasha' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 1, list_len is an integer, max_power is an integer, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of each string in the original operational_list that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_res is a string containing all elements from the original operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val, x is the last index of rev_val, x_rev is the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list. If the current value of rev_res is greater than 10 raised to the power of max_power, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, if the integer value of the reverse of the last string in the original operational_list is less than or equal to 10 to the power of the integer value of max_power, 'Anna' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and are at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and are at odd indices in rev_val, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list, x is the length of rev_val. If 10 raised to the power of max_power is less than the integer value of rev_res, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
