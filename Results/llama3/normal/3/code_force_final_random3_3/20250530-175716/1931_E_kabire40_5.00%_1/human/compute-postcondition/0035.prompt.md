Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is an empty list, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` that have the same length as their reverse, and `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length as their reverse.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse. If x is even, the value of the xth element of rev_val is added to rev_res. If x is odd, the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res. rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from operational_list that do not have the same length as their reverse and has at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from operational_list that do not have the same length as their reverse and has at least two elements, x is 1. rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse. If x is even, the value of the xth element of rev_val is added to rev_res. If x is odd, the reverse of the xth element of rev_val is added to rev_res and val_in is the xth element of rev_val.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from operational_list that do not have the same length as their reverse and has at least two elements, x is 2. rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse. If x is even, the value of the xth element of rev_val is added to rev_res. If x is odd, the reverse of the xth element of rev_val is added to rev_res and val_in is the second element of rev_val if x is even, otherwise val_in is the reverse of the second element of rev_val.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
