Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string value of the third element in `operational_list` plus `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the third element in `operational_list` and `rev_res` is an empty string plus `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `x_rev` has been updated to the integer value of the reverse of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditional statements regarding `rev_res` and `rev_val` are still valid, but the value of `x_rev` has been updated, which may affect the conditions.
