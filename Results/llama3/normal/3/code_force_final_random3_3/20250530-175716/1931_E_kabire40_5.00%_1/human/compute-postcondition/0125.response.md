Output: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse plus the string representation of the integer value of the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and are at even indices in rev_val plus the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and are at odd indices in rev_val, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list, x is the length of rev_val. The current value of 10 raised to the power of max_power is less than the integer value of rev_res, and 'Sasha' is printed**
