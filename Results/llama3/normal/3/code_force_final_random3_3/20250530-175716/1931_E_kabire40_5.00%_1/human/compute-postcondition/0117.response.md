Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list, x is 1. If x is even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If x is odd, rev_res is updated to include the reverse of the string at index x in rev_val.***
