Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, x is the first string in the list, rev_val is either an empty list or a list containing the reverse of the first string in operational_list, rev_res is either an empty string or the first string in the list, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the first string in operational_list. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the first string in the list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the first string in operational_list.***
