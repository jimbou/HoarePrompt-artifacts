Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 2, `list_len` is an integer equal to the first input value, `max_power` is an integer equal to the second input value, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `x` is the third string in the list, `x_rev` is an integer equal to the reverse of the third string in the list converted to an integer, `rev_val` is a list that contains the reverse of the third string in the list.**

In this output state, the code has appended the reverse of the third string in the list (`x`) to the `rev_val` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `rev_val` list now contains the reversed string of `x`, which is the third string in the `operational_list`.
