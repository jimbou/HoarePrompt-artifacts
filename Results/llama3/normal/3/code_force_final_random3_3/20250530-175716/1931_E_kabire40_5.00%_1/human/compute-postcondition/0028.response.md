Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 0, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse and the value of the xth element of rev_val, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all elements from operational_list that do not have the same length as their reverse and has at least two elements, x is 1**

In this output state, the value of the xth element of rev_val is added to rev_res because x is 1, which is an odd number. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
