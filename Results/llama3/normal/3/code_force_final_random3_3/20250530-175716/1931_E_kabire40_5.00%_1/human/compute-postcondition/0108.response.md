According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rev_val`. If `rev_val` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, x is the last string in the initial operational_list, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list. Either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' is printed depending on the value of rev_res and max_power. So for the loop to be executed  the rev_val must have at least 1 element and x is 0.
State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, list_len is an integer equal to the first input value, max_power is an integer equal to the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, x is 0, rev_val is a sorted list containing the reverse of all strings in the initial operational_list that have a different length than their reverse and must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string containing all strings in the initial operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, x_rev is an integer value of the reverse of the last string in the initial operational_list.**
