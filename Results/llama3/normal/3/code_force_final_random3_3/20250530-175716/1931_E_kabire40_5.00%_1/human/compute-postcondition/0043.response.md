The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than the integer value of the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, the input is not empty and its integer value is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1 and the input must be read one more time.
State: **stdin is not empty, y is 1, list_len and max_power are strings representing the second and third input values respectively, operational_list is a list that must have at least one element that does not have the same length as its reverse, rev_val is a list, rev_res is a string containing all elements from operational_list that have the same length as their reverse, plus the value of each even-indexed element in rev_val and the reverse of each odd-indexed element in rev_val. If the current value of rev_res is higher than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power, 'Sasha' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is being printed.**
