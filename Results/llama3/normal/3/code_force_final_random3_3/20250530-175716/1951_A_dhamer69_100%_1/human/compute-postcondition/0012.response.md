Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n` (exclusive of 2), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is assigned the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the binary string `s`. The size of `s` is `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 50, and not equal to 2. Therefore, the value of `count_1` can be any integer between 0 and `n` (exclusive of 2), since `s` can contain any combination of '0's and '1's. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
