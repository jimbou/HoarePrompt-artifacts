The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 48, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 48, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases.**
