Reasoning: The given Python program is correct. It correctly handles the base case when n is 2, and for larger n, it checks if the count of '1's is even and if there are any adjacent '1's. If the count of '1's is odd or if there are adjacent '1's and the count of '1's is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the execution states provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
