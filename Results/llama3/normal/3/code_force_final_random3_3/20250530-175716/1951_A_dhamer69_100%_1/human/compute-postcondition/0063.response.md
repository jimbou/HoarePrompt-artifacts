Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin is empty. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the variable `t` has reached 0. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The stdin is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remain the same as in the previous output states.
