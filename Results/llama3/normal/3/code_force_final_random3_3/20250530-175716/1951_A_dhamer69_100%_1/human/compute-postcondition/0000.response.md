The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, the first integer is accepted and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n**
