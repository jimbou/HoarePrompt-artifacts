Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 49, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the binary string `s`, which can range from 0 to `n` (the length of the string). The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
