Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 48, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was an integer between 1 and 50, it remains an integer between 1 and 50. The second line assigns the binary string value of the input to `s`. Since `s` was a binary string of size `n`, it remains a binary string of size `n`. No other variables are affected. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
