Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 49, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if the count of 1's in s is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of 1's in s is even, then if s contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and the count of 1's is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
