Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 50, as it is assigned the value of the first input from stdin. The value of `s` is a binary string of size `n`, as it is assigned the value of the second input from stdin. Stdin now contains one less test case, as two inputs have been read and processed.
