Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 48, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if the count of 1's in `s` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of 1's in `s` is even, then if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and the count of 1's is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 47, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 equals 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
