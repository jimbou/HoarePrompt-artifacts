Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a binary string s of size n. It then checks the string s based on the value of n. If n is 2, it prints 'YES' if the string is '00', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If n is not 2, it counts the number of '1's in the string and checks if it's even or odd. If the count is odd, it prints 'NO'. If the count is even, it checks if the string contains exactly one '11' and the count of '1's is 2. If both conditions are true, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.**
