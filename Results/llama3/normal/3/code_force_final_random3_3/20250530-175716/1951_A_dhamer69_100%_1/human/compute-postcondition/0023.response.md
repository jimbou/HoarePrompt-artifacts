Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n` (exclusive of 2), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `count_1` is even. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
