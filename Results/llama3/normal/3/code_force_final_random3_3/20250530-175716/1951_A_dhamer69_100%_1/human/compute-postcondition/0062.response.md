Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 equals 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is decreased by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `t` is now between 0 and 47, and the rest of the conditions and variables are unchanged.
