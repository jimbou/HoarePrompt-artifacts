Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n` (exclusive of 2), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `count_1` is even. The current value of `count_1` is 2, and the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', and 'NO' is being printed**
