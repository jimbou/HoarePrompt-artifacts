Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 48, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If n is 2, then if s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 equals 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
