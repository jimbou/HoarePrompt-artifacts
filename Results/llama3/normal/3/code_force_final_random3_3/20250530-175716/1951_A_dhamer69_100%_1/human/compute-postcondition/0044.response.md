Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if the count of 1's in `s` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If the count of 1's in `s` is even, then if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and the count of 1's is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 48. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as well as the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases.
