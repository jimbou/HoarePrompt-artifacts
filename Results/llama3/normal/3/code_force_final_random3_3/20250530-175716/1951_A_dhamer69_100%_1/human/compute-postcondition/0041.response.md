Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 49, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and `count_1` is 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
