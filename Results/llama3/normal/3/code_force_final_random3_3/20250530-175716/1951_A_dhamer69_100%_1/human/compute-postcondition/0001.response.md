The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n**
