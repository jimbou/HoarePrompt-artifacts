Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a binary string of size `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 49. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values of `n`, `s`, and count_1 remain the same.
