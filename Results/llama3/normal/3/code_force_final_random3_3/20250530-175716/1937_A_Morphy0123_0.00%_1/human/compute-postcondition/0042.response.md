The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is log2(n) - 1.
Since `power` is log2(n) - 1, the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is equal to 2^(log2(n) - 1).
Using the property of logarithms that a^(loga(x)) = x, we can simplify 2^(log2(n) - 1) to n/2.
Therefore, the code prints the value of n/2.
Output: **n/2 (where n is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n))**
