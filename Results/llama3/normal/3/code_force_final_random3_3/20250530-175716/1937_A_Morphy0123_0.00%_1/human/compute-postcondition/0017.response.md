Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). The current value of `power` equals `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` which is equal to 2n is being printed**
