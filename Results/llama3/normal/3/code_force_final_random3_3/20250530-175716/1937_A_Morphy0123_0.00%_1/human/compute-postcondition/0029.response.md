To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `power < log2(n)`.

Given that `power` is 1 and `n` is an integer, for the loop to execute at least once, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1. This implies that `n` must be greater than 2 (since `log2(2) = 1` and `log2(n) > 1` for `n > 2`).

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `power` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**
