Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially), and `power` is not equal to `n`**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `power` being equal to `log2(n)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but with one less line than initially. The relationship between `power` and `n` remains the same, with `power` not being equal to `n`.
