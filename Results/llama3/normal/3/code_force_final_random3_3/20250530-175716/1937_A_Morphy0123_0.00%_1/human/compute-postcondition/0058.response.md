Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially).**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `power` will be equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and `n` must be greater than 2 raised to the power of `log2(n)`. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and there is still one less line in the input than initially.
