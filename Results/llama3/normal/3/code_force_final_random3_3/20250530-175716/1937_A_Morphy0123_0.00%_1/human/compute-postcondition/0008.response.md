The only variables in the loop head are variables `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `power` is 1 and `n` is an integer not equal to 1. `n` being an integer not equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` must be greater than 2 (because `log2(n)` is greater than 1 when `n` is greater than 2). No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**
