Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `power` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially).**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 2. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n_cases` still being an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remaining 0, and `n` still being greater than 2. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but with one less line than initially.
