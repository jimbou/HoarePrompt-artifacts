Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of an integer representing the length of an array. For each case, it calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given length, or 1 if the length is 1. The function processes all test cases and consumes all input from standard input, leaving no remaining input.**
