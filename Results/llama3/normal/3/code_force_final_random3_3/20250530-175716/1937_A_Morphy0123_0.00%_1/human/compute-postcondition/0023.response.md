Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is either log2(n) or log2(n) + 1. If `power` equals `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` which is equal to 2n is being printed. Otherwise, 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed, where `power` is equal to log2(n).***
