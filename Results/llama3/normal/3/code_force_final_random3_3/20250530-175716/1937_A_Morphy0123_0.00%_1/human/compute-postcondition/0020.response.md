The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`. Since `power` is not equal to `n`, the printed value will be less than `n`. The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is known to be greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `power`.

Output: **2^log2(n) (where n is the value of n)**
