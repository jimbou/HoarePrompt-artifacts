Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `power` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is either log2(n) or log2(n) + 1.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been updated to 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `power` is now a constant, and it is no longer dependent on the value of `n`.
