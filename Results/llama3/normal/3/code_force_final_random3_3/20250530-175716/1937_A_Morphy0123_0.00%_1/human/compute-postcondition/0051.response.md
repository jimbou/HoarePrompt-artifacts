To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `power < log2(n)`.

Given the initial states:
- `n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer that was read from the input
- `power` is 1
- stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)
- If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed

The loop condition involves `power` and `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true.

1. **Adjusting `power`**: Since `power` is already 1, we cannot adjust it further down because it's already at its minimum for the loop to potentially execute (considering `log2(n)` could be very small, but it cannot be less than 1 for the loop to execute given `power` is 1).

2. **Adjusting `n`**: The critical factor here is `log2(n)`. For `power < log2(n)` to be true when `power` is 1, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1. This implies `n` must be greater than 2 (since `log2(2) = 1` and `log2(n) > 1` when `n > 2`).

Given `n` is an integer read from the input, and considering the condition for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `n` is adjusted so that it's greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**
