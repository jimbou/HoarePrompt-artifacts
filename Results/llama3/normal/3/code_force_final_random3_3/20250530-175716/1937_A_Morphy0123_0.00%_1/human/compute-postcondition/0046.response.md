The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and `n_cases` is still an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive).
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is either log2(n) or log2(n) + 1. If `power` equals `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` which is equal to 2n is being printed. Otherwise, 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed, where `power` is equal to log2(n).**
