According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. `n` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2^2 (i.e., `n` is greater than 4). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 4, `power` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**
