The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the next integer from the input to the variable `n`. Since the first line of the input has already been consumed, the next line is read and its integer value is assigned to `n`. The values of `n_cases` and `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**
