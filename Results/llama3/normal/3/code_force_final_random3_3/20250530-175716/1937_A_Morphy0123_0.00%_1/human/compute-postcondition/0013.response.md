Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2^3, `power` is 4, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1, so its new value is 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but with one less line than initially.
