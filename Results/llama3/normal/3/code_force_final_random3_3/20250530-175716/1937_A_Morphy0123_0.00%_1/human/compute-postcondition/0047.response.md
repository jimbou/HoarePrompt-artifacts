Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is either log2(n) or log2(n) + 1. If `power` equals `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` which is equal to 2n is being printed. Otherwise, 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed, where `power` is equal to log2(n).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer read from the input. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. Note that the number of lines in stdin has decreased by one since an input was read.
