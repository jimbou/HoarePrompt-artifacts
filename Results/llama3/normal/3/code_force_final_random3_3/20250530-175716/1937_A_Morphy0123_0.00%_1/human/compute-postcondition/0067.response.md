Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n). If the current value of `power` is equal to the current value of `n`, then the value of `n` is printed. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1 and 2 raised to the power of `power` is printed.***
