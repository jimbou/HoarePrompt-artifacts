Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) - 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially), and `power` is not equal to `n`**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, but all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `n` and `power` is still valid, as `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), and `power` is still not equal to `n`. The number of lines in stdin has not changed, as the code only decrements the value of `power` without affecting the input.
