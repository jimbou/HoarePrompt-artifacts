The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to the current value of `n`. Since `power` is also equal to `log2(n)`, the expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** log2(n)`, which simplifies to `n`. Therefore, the code prints the value of `n`.

Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). The current value of `power` is equal to the current value of `n`, and the value of `n` is being printed**
