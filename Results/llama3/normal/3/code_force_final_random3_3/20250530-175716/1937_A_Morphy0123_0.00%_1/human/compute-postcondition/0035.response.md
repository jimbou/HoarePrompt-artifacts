Output State: `n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially).

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `power` will be equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and `n` will be greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of the base-2 logarithm of `n`. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and there is still one less line of input in stdin than initially.
