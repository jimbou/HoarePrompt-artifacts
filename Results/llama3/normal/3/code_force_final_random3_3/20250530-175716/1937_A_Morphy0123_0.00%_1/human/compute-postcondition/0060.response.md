The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`, where `power` is equal to `log2(n)`. Since `power` is equal to `n`, the expression can be rewritten as `2 ** n`.

However, the initial state also states that `n` must be greater than `2 ** log2(n)`. This implies that `n` is greater than `2 ** power`, since `power` is equal to `log2(n)`.

Therefore, the output will be a value greater than `n`, specifically `2` raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2^n (where n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, inclusive, and n is greater than 2^log2(n))**
