Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n_cases` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of the base-2 logarithm of `n`, `power` is the base-2 logarithm of `n` plus 1, and the number of lines in stdin remains one less than initially.
