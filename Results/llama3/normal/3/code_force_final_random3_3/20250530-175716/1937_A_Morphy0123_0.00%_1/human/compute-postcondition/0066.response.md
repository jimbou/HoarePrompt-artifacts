Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n). If the current value of `power` is equal to the current value of `n`, then the value of `n` is printed. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1 and 2 raised to the power of `power` is printed.***
