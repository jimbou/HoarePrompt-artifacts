Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was read from the input, `power` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been updated to 1. The other variables, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but one less line than initially. The conditions for printing the number 1 or 2 raised to the power of `power` are still applicable based on the value of `n`.
