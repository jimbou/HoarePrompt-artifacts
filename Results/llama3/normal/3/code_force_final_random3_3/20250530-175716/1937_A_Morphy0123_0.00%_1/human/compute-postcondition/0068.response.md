Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `n_cases`, stdin contains no lines of input.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n_cases` will be the same as the initial value, but `i` will be equal to `n_cases` because the loop has iterated `n_cases` times. The stdin will be empty because all lines of input have been consumed by the loop.
