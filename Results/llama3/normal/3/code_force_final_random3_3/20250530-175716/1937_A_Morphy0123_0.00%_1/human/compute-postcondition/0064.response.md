The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is `log2(n) - 1`. Since `n` is greater than `2^log2(n)`, `log2(n)` is the integer part of the logarithm base 2 of `n`. Therefore, `power` is the integer part of the logarithm base 2 of `n` minus 1.

Output: **2^(log2(n) - 1) (where n is an integer greater than 2^log2(n))**
