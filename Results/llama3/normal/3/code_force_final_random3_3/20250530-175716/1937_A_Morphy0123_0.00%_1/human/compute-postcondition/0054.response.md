Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2^3, `power` is 3, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition on `n` has also been updated to be greater than 2^3, since `power` is now 3. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but with one less line than initially.
