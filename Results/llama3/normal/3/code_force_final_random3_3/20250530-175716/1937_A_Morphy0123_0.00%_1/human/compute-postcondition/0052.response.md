Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1. Initially, `power` was 1, so after the increment, its value becomes 2. The other variables, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`, remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, with one less line than initially.
