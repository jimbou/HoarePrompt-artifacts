Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). If the current value of `power` is equal to `n`, then 2 raised to the power of `power` which is equal to `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1 and 2 raised to the power of `power` which is equal to 2^(log2(n) - 1) is being printed.***
