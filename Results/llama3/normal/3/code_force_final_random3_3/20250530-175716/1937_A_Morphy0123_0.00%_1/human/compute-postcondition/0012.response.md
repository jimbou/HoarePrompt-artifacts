To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 2^2.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 2^3, since `power` is 3 and we want `power` to be less than `log2(n)`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2^3, `power` is 3, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**
