The code `n_cases = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. After executing the code, the first line of the input is consumed, and the remaining lines are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line has been consumed.**
