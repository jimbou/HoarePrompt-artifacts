Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) - 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). The value of `power` is not equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, while the values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but with one less line than initially. The relationship between `power` and `n` is still maintained, with `power` being less than `n`.
