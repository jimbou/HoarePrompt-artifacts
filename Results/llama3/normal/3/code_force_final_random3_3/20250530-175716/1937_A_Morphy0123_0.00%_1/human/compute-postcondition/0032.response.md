Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 4, `power` is 3, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 3. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but with one less line than initially.
