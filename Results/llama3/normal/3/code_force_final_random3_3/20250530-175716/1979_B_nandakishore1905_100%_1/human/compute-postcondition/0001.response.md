The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `m`. Since stdin contains at least one integer value greater than 0, `n` and `m` will be integers greater than 0. The second line assigns the absolute difference between `n` and `m` to `k`. Since `n` and `m` are integers, `k` will be a non-negative integer. The third line does not affect any variables.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 0, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin is empty**
