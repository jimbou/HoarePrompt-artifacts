Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is equal to the number of test cases, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between n and m (k) is a power of 2, then k is printed for each test case. Otherwise, if k is odd, the number 1 is printed for each test case. If k is even but not a power of 2, the value of a power of 2 is printed for each test case.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all test cases, and the values of n, m, and k have been processed according to the loop's logic. The loop counter i has reached the total number of test cases, and the input stream (stdin) is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The output for each test case is either the absolute difference k (if it's a power of 2), 1 (if k is odd), or a power of 2 (if k is even but not a power of 2).
