Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer greater than 1, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be integers greater than 1, as they are read from stdin which contains an integer greater than 1. The value of `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between the new values of `n` and `m`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. Stdin is now empty as it has been read from.
