To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `i`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must not be empty, and the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is not empty and contains a string that represents an integer greater than 0**
