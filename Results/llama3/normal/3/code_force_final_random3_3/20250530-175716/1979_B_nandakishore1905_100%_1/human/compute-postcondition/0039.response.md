Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 0, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between n and m (k) is a power of 2, then k is printed. Otherwise, if k is odd, the number 1 is printed. If k is even but not a power of 2, a string of binary digits representing 0 is printed, along with the values p=1, q=1, and f=0.***
