Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer greater than 1, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin is empty. If the absolute difference between n and m (k) is a power of 2, then k is printed. Otherwise, if k is odd, the number 1 is printed. If k is even, n is not equal to m, k is not a power of 2, then the value of a power of 2 is printed.***
