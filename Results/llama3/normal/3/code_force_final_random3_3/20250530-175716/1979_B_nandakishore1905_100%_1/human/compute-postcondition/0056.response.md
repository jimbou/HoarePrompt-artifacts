Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer greater than 1, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin is empty. If k is odd, the number 1 is printed. If k is even, n is not equal to m, k is not a power of 2, l is a string of binary digits representing f, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1, f is a power of 2, and the value of f which is a power of 2 is printed.***
