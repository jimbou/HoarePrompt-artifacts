The code prints the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
Since `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, and `k` is the absolute difference between them, `k` will be a non-negative integer.
Output: **the absolute difference between n and m (where n and m are integers greater than 0)**
