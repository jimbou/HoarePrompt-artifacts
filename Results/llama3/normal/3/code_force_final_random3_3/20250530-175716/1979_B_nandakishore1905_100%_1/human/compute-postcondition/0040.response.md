The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input from `stdin`. If `i` is less than the integer read from `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `stdin` must not be empty and must contain an integer greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, stdin is not empty and contains an integer greater than 1**
