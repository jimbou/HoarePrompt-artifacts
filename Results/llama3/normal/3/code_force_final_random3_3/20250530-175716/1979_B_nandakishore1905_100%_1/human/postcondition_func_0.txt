The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers x and y. It calculates the absolute difference k between x and y and prints a value based on the following conditions: if k is a power of 2, it prints k; if k is odd, it prints 1; if k is even but not a power of 2, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
