To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as the input from `stdin` provides an integer value that can be converted to an integer and is within the range of `int` data type in Python (which is not bounded but practically limited by available memory).

Since the loop will iterate over the range of the integer input from `stdin`, we need to ensure that this input is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Also, since `i` is the loop variable, its initial state should be the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **stdin contains at least one integer value greater than 0, i is 0**
