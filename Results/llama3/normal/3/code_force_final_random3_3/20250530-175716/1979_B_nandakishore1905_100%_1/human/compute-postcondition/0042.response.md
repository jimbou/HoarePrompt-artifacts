The code prints the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1 and `m` is an integer greater than 1, `k` will be a non-negative integer representing the absolute difference between these two values.
Output: **the absolute difference between n and m (where n and m are integers greater than 1)**
