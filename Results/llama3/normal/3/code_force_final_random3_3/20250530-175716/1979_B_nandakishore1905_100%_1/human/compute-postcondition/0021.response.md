Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 0, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin is empty. If k is a power of 2, the value of k is printed. If k is not a power of 2, if k is odd, 1 is printed. If k is even, 0 is printed along with the binary representation of 0, and variables l, p, q, and f are set to "0", 1, 1, and 0 respectively.**
