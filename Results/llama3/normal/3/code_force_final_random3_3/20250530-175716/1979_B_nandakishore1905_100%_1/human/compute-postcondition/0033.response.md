The only variable in the loop head is variable f, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable f.  If f & f - 1 != 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, f is a value that ensures f & f - 1 != 0 and is equal to its original value minus q with at least one additional bit set to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time f & f - 1 must still be not equal to 0. Since f is equal to its original value minus q with at least one additional bit set to 1, f must have been equal to its original value minus q with at least two additional bits set to 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer greater than 0, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, l is a string of binary digits representing f, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1, f is a value that ensures f & f - 1 != 0 and is equal to its original value minus q with at least two additional bits set to 1**
