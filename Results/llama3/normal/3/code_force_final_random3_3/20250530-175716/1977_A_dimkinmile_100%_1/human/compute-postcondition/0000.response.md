The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` accepts a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `m`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, the first line of input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. This line is consumed by `input()`, and `t` is not assigned to any variable. However, the information that there are `t-1` test cases left is still valid.

The values of `n` and `m` are updated to be two integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) from the second line of input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, there are `t-1` test cases left, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**
