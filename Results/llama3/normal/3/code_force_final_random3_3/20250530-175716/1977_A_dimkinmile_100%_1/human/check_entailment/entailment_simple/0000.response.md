Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and greater than or equal to 0. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes", indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The reasoning behind this condition is that if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, it means that Nikita can make an equal number of moves to add and remove cubes, resulting in a tower with exactly `m` cubes. If the difference is odd, it means that Nikita will have to make an odd number of moves, which will result in a tower with an odd number of cubes, not exactly `m` cubes.

The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves `n` is sufficient to build a tower with at least `m` cubes.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
