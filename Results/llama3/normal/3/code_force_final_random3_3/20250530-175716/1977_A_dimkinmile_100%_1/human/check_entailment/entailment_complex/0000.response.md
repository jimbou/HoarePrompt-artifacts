Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem statement asks to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program correctly checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative. If the difference is even and non-negative, it means that Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs, resulting in a tower with m cubes. If the difference is odd or negative, it's not possible to have a tower with m cubes.

The program also correctly handles multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases from the first line of input and processing each test case separately.

Therefore, the program produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
