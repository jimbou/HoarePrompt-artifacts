Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining if it's possible to build a tower with a specific number of cubes after a certain number of moves. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

The program then checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. If the difference is even and non-negative, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program's logic is correct because:

* If the difference between `n` and `m` is even, it means that the number of moves is sufficient to add or remove the required number of cubes to reach the desired tower height.
* If the difference is non-negative, it means that the number of moves is not less than the desired number of cubes, which is a necessary condition to build the tower.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will cause a `NameError` in Python. The function definition should be moved above the `for` loop that calls it.

Correctness: **False** (due to the function definition issue, but the logic is correct)
