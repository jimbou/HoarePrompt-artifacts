Functionality: **This function reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from standard input and determines if their difference is even and non-negative. If the difference is even and non-negative, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases is specified in the first line of input. After processing each test case, the function leaves the remaining test cases in the standard input.**
