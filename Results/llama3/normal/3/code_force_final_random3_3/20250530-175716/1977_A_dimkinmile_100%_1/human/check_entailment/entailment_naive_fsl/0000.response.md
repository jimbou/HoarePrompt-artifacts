Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even and non-negative. This is because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of cubes must be within the range of the number of moves. If the condition is met, the program prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where n or m is 0.
