Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the tower.

2. The given program defines a function func_1() that takes two integers n and m as input, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

3. Inside the function, it checks if the difference between n and m (n - m) is even and non-negative. This is because Nikita can only add or remove cubes one at a time, so the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even for it to be possible.

4. If the condition is met, the function prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to end up with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

5. The program then reads an integer kreker, representing the number of test cases, and iterates over a range of kreker. In each iteration, it calls the func_1() function.

6. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with m cubes after n moves. The condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0 is not sufficient to guarantee that it's possible to end up with m cubes.

7. For example, if n = 5 and m = 3, the condition is met, but it's not possible to end up with 3 cubes after 5 moves.

8. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
