To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(mdx, n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range defined by `mdx` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `mdx + 2`.

The value of `mdx` is not changed, as it is not a variable in the loop head that is modified by the loop. The value of `n` is also not changed, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2**
