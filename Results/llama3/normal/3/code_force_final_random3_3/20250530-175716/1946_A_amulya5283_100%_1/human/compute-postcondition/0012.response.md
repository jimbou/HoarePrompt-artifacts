To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to be `mdx + 1`.

The state of `mdx` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, so we cannot adjust its state. However, since `i` is equal to `mdx` at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that `mdx` is also equal to its original value.

The state of `n` is not changed by the loop, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1**
