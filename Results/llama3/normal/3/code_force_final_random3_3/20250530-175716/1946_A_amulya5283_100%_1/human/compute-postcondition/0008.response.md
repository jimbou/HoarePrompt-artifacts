To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `mdx` is less than `n`. Since `mdx` is the integer part of half of `n` plus the remainder of `n` divided by 2 minus 1, we can infer that `mdx` is less than `n` if `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `mdx` is less than `n`
* `i` is equal to `mdx`
* `n` is greater than 1

The other variables `t`, `a`, `stdin`, and `res` are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `res` is 0, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`**
