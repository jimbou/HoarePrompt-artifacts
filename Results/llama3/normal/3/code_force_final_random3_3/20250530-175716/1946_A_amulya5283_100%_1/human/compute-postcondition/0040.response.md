Output: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` must be less than `n`, `i` is `n`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[mdx, n)`, then `res` is equal to the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)`, otherwise `res` is less than the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)`, and the value of `res` is being printed**
