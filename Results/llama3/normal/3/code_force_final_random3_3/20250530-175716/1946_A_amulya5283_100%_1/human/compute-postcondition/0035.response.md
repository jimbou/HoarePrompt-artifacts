To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `t` remains the same, as it is not in the loop head.
* `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop.
* `a` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop.
* `stdin` remains the same, as it is not in the loop head.
* `mdx` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop.
* `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `mdx + 2`.
* `res` is not in the loop head, but its value may have changed in the previous iteration. However, we don't have enough information to determine its new value.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mdx + 2`**
