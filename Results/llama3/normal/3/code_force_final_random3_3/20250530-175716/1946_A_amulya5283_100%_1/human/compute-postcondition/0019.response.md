The code prints the value of `res`, which is the count of occurrences of the maximum element in the sorted list `a`. Since `mdx` is less than `n` and `i` is equal to `n - 1`, the comparison `a[mdx] == a[i]` checks if the element at index `mdx` is equal to the maximum element in the list (which is at index `i`). If they are equal, `res` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `res` represents the number of times the maximum element appears in the list.

Output: **the count of occurrences of the maximum element in the sorted list a**
