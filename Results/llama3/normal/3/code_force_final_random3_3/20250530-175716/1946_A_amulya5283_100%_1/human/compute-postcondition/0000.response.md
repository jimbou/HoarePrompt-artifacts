The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is accepted and assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs in the stdin are still valid. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a space-separated list of integers and then the next test case. The length of the list is equal to the first integer accepted in the previous test case. All integers are between 1 and 10^9.**
