To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(mdx, n):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx`, which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mdx + 1`**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `i`, as it is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be updated for the loop to execute again. The other variables, such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `mdx`, remain unchanged.
