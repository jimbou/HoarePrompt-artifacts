Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `res` is 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mdx`. The current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still a positive integer, which is 2 less than its original value and greater than 0. The value of `n` is still an integer, and `a` is still a sorted list of integers. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still two less than the original number. The value of `mdx` is still `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, which is less than `n`, and `i` is still equal to `mdx`. The current value of `a[mdx]` is still equal to the current value of `a[i]`.
