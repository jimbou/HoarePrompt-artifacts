Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and `n` is greater than `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, `res` is 1, `mdx` is an integer equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is an integer equal to `mdx`. The current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original relationships and values. The input values in `stdin` are still present, minus three test cases.
