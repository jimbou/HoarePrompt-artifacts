To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(mdx, n):`. The objects involved are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The state of `mdx` is not changed, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `n` is also not changed, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and `n` is greater than `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, `mdx` is an integer equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is an integer equal to `mdx + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is 1, otherwise `res` remains 0.**
