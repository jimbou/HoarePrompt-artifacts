Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t must be greater than 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, res is an integer, mdx is an integer, i is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If n is equal to 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, if n is greater than mdx, mdx is set to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1 and is less than n, i is set to n. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i], then res is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, res is 1. and the value of res is printed.***
