According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t must be greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than 0. Since t is already greater than 0, we need to ensure that t is greater than 2 so that after the next iteration, t will still be greater than 0. Therefore, t must be greater than 2.

State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t must be greater than 2, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, res is an integer, mdx is an integer, i is an integer.**
