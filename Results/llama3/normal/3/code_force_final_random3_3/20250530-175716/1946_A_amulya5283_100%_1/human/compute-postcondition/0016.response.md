Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2, `res` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `t` is still a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is still an integer greater than 1, `a` is still a sorted list of integers, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, `mdx` is still less than `n`, and `i` is still equal to `mdx + 2`.
