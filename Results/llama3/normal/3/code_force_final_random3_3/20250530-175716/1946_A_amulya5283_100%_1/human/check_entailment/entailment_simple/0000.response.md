Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. 

Here's why:

- The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
- It then sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
- If the length of the array `n` is 1, it prints 1 because only one operation is required to increase the median (which is the only element in the array).
- If the length of the array `n` is greater than 1, it calculates the index of the median `mdx` using the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula correctly calculates the index of the median for both even and odd length arrays.
- It then initializes a variable `res` to 0 and iterates over the range from `mdx` to `n`. For each element in this range, it checks if the element is equal to the median `a[mdx]`. If it is, it increments `res` by 1.
- Finally, it prints the value of `res`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the median of the array and then counts the number of elements that are equal to the median. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median because each operation can increase one element.

Correctness: **True**
