Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer (the length of the array) followed by a space-separated list of integers.
2. It sorts the list of integers, which is necessary to find the median.
3. If the list has only one element, it correctly prints 1, because increasing the only element will increase the median.
4. If the list has more than one element, it correctly calculates the median index `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This is because the median is the middle element when `n` is odd, and the element just after the middle when `n` is even.
5. It then counts the number of occurrences of the median element in the second half of the list (from `mdx` to `n`). This is because increasing any of these elements will increase the median.
6. Finally, it prints the count of the median element's occurrences in the second half of the list, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
