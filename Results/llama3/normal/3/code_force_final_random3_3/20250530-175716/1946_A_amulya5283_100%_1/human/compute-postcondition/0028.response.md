To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `mdx` and `n`. If `mdx` is less than `n`, the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mdx`**
