The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer, which already ensures that the loop will execute. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a space-separated list of integers and then the next test case. The length of the list is equal to the first integer accepted in the previous test case. All integers are between 1 and 10^9.**
