Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `t`, `n`, `mdx`, and `i` are still valid, and the list `a` remains sorted. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
