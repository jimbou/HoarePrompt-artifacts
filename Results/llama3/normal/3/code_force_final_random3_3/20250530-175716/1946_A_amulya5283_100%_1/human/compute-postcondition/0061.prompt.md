Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a space-separated list of integers and then the next test case. The length of the list is equal to the first integer accepted in the previous test case. All integers are between 1 and 10^9.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        res = 0
        mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
        for i in range(mdx, n):
            if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                res += 1
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. If n is greater than 1, mdx is less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and if a[mdx] is equal to a[i], then res is increased by 1, and the value of res is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, res is an integer, mdx is an integer, i is an integer. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is n // 2 + n % 2 - 1 and mdx must be less than n, i is n. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for all i in the range [mdx, n), then res is equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), otherwise res is less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), and the value of res is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t must be greater than 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, res is an integer, mdx is an integer, i is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If n is equal to 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, if n is greater than mdx, mdx is set to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1 and is less than n, i is set to n. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i], then res is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, res is 1. and the value of res is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
