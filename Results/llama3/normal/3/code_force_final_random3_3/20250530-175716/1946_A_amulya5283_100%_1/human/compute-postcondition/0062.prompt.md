You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the length of the array) and then a space-separated list of integers. The length of the list is equal to the first integer. All integers are between 1 and 10^9.
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: t is equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, res is an integer, mdx is an integer, i is an integer. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is n // 2 + n % 2 - 1 and mdx must be less than n, i is n. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for all i in the range [mdx, n), then res is equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), otherwise res is less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), and the value of res is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, res is an integer, mdx is an integer, i is an integer. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is n // 2 + n % 2 - 1 and mdx must be less than n, i is n. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for all i in the range [mdx, n), then res is equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), otherwise res is less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), and the value of res is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
