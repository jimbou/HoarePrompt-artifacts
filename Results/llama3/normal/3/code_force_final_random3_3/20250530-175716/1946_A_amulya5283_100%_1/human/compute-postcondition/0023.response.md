The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1 and t must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. If n is greater than 1, mdx is less than n, i is equal to n - 1, and if a[mdx] is equal to a[i], then res is increased by 1, and the value of res is printed.**
