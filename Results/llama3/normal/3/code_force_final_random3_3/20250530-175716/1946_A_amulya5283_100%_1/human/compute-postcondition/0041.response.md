Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t must be greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, res is an integer, mdx is an integer, i is an integer. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is n // 2 + n % 2 - 1 and mdx must be less than n, i is n. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for all i in the range [mdx, n), then res is equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), otherwise res is less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), and the value of res is being printed.***
