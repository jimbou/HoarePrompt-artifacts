Output State: **t is equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, res is an integer, mdx is an integer, i is an integer. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is n // 2 + n % 2 - 1 and mdx must be less than n, i is n. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for all i in the range [mdx, n), then res is equal to the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), otherwise res is less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n), and the value of res is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable t is now 0. The variables n, a, res, mdx, and i retain their last values from the loop. The stdin is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. If the last test case had only one element, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of res, which represents the number of occurrences of the median element in the sorted list a, is printed.
