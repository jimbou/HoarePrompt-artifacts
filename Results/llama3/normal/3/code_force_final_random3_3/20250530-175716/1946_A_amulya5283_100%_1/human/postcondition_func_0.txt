This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the length of the array) followed by a space-separated list of integers. It sorts the list of integers and then counts the number of occurrences of the middle element (or the element just after the middle if the length is even) in the second half of the list. If the list has only one element, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the count of the middle element's occurrences in the second half of the list. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
