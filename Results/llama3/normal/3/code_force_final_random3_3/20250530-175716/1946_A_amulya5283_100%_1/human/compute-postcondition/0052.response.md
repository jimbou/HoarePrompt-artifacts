Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and `n` is greater than `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, `mdx` is an integer equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is an integer equal to `mdx + 1`, `res` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. Initially, `res` was either 0 or 1, depending on whether `a[mdx]` was equal to `a[i]`. After the code execution, `res` is either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
