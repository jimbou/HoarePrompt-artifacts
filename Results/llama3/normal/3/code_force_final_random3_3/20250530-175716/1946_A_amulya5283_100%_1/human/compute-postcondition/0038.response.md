Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` must be less than `n`, `i` is `n`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[mdx, n)`, then `res` is equal to the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)`, otherwise `res` is less than the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `n` remains an integer, `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus two. The loop variable `i` has reached the end of the loop, which is `n`. The variable `res` now holds the count of occurrences of the middle element `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)` if all elements in this range are equal to `a[mdx]`, otherwise, it holds a count less than the total occurrences of `a[mdx]` in this range.
