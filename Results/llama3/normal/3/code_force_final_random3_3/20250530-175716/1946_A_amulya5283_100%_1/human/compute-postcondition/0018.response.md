Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer and is greater than 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, mdx is less than n, i is equal to n - 1. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i], then res is increased by 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` remains an integer greater than 1, `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one. The variable `mdx` is still less than `n`, and `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` has been increased by 1 for each iteration where this condition was true.
