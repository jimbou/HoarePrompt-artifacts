Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still a positive integer, which is 2 less than its original value and greater than 0. The value of `n` is still an integer, and `a` is still a sorted list of integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The value of `mdx` is still `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and is less than `n`. The value of `i` is still `mdx + 1`.
