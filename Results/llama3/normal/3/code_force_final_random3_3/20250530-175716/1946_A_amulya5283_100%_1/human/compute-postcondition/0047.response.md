To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `i` is the loop variable, and its initial value is not explicitly set before the loop. For the loop to execute, `i` should be equal to `mdx`.
2. `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute, `mdx` must be less than `n`.
3. `n` is an integer equal to the input value. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `mdx`.

Considering these conditions, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `i` is equal to `mdx`.
* `mdx` is less than `n`.
* `n` is greater than `mdx`.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `res`, and `stdin`) are not directly related to the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and `n` is greater than `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, `res` is 0, `mdx` is an integer equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is an integer equal to `mdx`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three**
