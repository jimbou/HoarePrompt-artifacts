Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`***
