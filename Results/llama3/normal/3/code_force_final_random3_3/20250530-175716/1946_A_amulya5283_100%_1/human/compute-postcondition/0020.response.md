Output: **t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer and is greater than 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, mdx is less than n, i is equal to n - 1. If a[mdx] is equal to a[i], then res is increased by 1, and the value of res is printed**
