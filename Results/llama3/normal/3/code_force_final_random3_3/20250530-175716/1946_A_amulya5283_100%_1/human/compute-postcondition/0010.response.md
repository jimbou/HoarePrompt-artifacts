Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `res` is 1, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

The code increments the value of `res` by 1, so the new value of `res` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is still an integer greater than 1, `a` is still a sorted list of integers, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, `mdx` is still less than `n`, `i` is still equal to `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is still equal to the current value of `a[i]`.
