The code prints the value of `res`, which depends on the condition `a[mdx]` being equal to `a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[mdx, n)`. If this condition is true, `res` is equal to the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)`. Otherwise, `res` is less than the number of occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the range `[mdx, n)`. Since the exact values of `a`, `mdx`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res` based on the condition.

Output: **res (where res is the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n) if a[mdx] is equal to a[i] for all i in the range [mdx, n), otherwise res is less than the number of occurrences of a[mdx] in the range [mdx, n))**
