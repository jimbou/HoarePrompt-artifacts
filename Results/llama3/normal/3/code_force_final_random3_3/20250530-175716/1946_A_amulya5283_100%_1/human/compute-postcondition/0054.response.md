To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(mdx, n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the range defined by `mdx` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `mdx`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `mdx + 2`.

The value of `mdx` is not changed, as it is not a variable that is updated within the loop. The value of `n` also remains the same, as it is not updated within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and `n` is greater than `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, `mdx` is an integer equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is an integer equal to `mdx + 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `res` remains 0.**
