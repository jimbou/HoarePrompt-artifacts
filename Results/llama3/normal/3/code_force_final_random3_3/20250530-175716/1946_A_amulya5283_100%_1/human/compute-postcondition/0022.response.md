According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0. So t must be greater than 1 at the beginning of the last iteration. So t must be greater than 1 at the beginning of the last iteration. So t must be greater than 1 at the beginning of the last iteration. So t must be greater than 1 at the beginning of the last iteration.
