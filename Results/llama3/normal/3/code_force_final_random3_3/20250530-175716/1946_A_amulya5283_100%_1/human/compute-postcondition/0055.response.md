Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and `n` is greater than `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, `mdx` is an integer equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is an integer equal to `mdx + 2`, `res` is either 1 or 2 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `res` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three.
