Output State: **`t` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and `n` is greater than `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, `mdx` is an integer equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer greater than 2, `n` being an integer equal to the input value and greater than `mdx`, `a` being a sorted list of integers equal to the input values, and `mdx` being an integer equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and less than `n`. The value of `res` depends on whether `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, and can be either 1 or 2 if they are equal, or 1 if they are not equal.
