The code reads an integer `t` from stdin, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`. The first line of the code assigns the values of `x` and `n` to the variables `x` and `n`, respectively. The second line initializes a variable `ans` to 0.

After the code executes, the value of `t` is no longer relevant, as it has been used to control the number of lines read from stdin. The values of `x` and `n` are now stored in the variables `x` and `n`, respectively. The variable `ans` has been initialized to 0.

Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 0, stdin is empty**
