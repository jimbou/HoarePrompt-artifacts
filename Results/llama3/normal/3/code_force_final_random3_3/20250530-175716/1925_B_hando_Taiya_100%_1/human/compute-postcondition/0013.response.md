Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is at least `x // 2` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, otherwise `ans` is at least 2, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be at least `x // 2` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, otherwise it remains at least 2. The values of `x`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `stdin` is still empty.
