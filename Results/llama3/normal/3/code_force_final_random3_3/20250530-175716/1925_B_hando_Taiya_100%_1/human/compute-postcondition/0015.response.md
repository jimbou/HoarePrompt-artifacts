Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is at least `x // 2`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is greater than `i`, then `ans` is at least 2. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then the state of `ans` is not changed.***
