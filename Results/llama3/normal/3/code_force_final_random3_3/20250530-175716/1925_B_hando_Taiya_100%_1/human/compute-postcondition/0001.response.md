The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and x, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
