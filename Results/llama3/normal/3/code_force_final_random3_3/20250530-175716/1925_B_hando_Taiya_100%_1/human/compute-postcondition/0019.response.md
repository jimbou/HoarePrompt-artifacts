Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(x // 2, x // 3)`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is greater than `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(3, x // 3)`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(3, x // 3)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than or equal to 9, and `i` is still 3. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and `x`. The value of `ans` has been updated to be at least the maximum of its previous value and `x` divided by `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is at least the maximum of `x` divided by 2 and `x` divided by 3. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is greater than `i`, then `ans` is at least the maximum of 3 and `x` divided by 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least the maximum of 3 and `x` divided by 3.
