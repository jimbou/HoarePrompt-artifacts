Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, `stdin` is empty.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`. This is because the loop iterates over all possible divisors of `x` (from 1 to the square root of `x`) and updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the divisor if the divisor is less than or equal to `n`. The state of `x`, `n`, and `stdin` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
