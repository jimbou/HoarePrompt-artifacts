The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `x` must be greater than or equal to 9 (because `isqrt(x) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 3).
State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is at least `x // 2`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is greater than `i`, then `ans` is at least 2. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then the state of `ans` is not changed.**
