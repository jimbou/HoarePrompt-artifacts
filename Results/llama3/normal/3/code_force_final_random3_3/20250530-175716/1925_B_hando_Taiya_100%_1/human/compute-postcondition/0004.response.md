The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (0) and `i` (1). Since `i` is 1, `ans` will be updated to 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, and the current value of `n` is still less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`. The stdin is still empty.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i`, `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`, stdin is empty.**
