Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is at least `x // 2`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is greater than `i`, then `ans` is at least 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least 3.***
