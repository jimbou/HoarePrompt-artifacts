Output: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, and stdin contains 0 input. If the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integer divisions of the values of the keys in dictionary `d` by 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. and the value of `shapes` is being printed**
