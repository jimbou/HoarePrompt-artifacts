The code prints the value of `shapes`, which is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Since `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is also an empty list, and `d` is a dictionary with no elements. Therefore, the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3 is 0.

As a result, `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 0, which means `shapes` is 0.

Output: **0**
