Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100)
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list that contains the first element of `palka` if it was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first and second elements of `palka` and `i` if they were not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least two key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first and second elements in the list `palka`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). If `d` does not contain `i`, then `d` contains at least three key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first and second elements in the list `palka` and `i`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`). Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `d` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains `i` and `d` contains `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `d` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first, second, third elements of `palka` and `i` if they were not already in `pl`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains `i` and `d` contains `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `d` is increased by 1. `d` is a dictionary that contains at least three key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first, second and third elements in the list `palka`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`). If `d` does not contain `i`, then `d` contains at least four key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first, second, third and fourth elements in the list `palka` and `i`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`). `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
