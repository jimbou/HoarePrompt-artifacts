The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first, second and third elements of `palka` and `i` if they were not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least three key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first, second and third elements in the list `palka`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). If `d` does not contain `i`, then `d` contains at least four key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first, second, third and fourth elements in the list `palka` and `i`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`). Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `d` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains `i` and `d` contains `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `d` is increased by 1.**
