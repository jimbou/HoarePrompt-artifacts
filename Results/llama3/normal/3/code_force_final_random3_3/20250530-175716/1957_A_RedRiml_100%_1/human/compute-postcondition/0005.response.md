Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) as a key and 1 as its value, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `i` is the first element in the list `palka`.**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated to include the first element of the list `palka` as a key with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n integers.
