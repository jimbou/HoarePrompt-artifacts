Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value 1 if `d.get(i)` is None, otherwise `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` twice if `i` is not in `pl`, otherwise `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` three times, stdin contains 0 input.**

In this output state, the value of `pl` has been updated to include the value of `i` (the third integer in the list `palka`) one more time. If `i` was not already in `pl`, it now appears twice in `pl`. If `i` was already in `pl`, it now appears three times in `pl`. All other variables remain unchanged.
