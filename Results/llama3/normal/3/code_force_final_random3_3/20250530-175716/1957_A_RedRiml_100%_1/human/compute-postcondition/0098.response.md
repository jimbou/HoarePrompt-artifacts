Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the third element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list that contains the third element of `palka` and if `d` does not have `i` as a key, then `d` is updated with `i` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` remains an integer, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `shapes` is still not defined, and `stdin` still contains -1 inputs. The value of `i` is still the third element in the list `palka`. A new list `pl` is created and it contains the third element of `palka`. The dictionary `d` is updated with `i` as a key and 1 as its value if `i` is not already a key in `d`, otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
