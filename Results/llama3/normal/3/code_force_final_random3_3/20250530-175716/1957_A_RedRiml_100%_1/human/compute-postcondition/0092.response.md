Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list with `i` repeated as its last two elements, `j` is the second last element in the list `pl`, and if `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, if `d` already contains the key `i`, then the value of `i` in `d` is increased by at least 1.**

In this output state, the list `pl` has been modified by appending the value of `i` to it, resulting in `i` being repeated as its last two elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
