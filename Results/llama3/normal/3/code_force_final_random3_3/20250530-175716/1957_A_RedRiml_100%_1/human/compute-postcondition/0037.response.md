Based on the precondition, the code prints the value of `shapes`, which is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3.

Since the exact values of the keys in the dictionary `d` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `shapes`.

Output: **a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary d divided by 3**
