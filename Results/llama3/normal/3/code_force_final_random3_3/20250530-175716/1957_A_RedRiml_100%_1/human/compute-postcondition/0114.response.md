Output: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from `palka`, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `palka`, `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `stdin` contains -1 inputs, and the number of shapes is printed, where the number of shapes is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3**
