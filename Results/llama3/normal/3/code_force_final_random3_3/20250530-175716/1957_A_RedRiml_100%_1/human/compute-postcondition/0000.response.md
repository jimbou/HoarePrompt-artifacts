Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `w` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each containing an integer n and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of the other variables are not affected.
