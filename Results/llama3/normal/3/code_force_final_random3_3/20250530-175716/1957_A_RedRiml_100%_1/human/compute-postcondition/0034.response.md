Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary, `j` is the third element in the list `pl`, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3.**

In this output state, the values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `shapes`, which is increased by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. This means that `shapes` is now equal to its previous value plus the result of `d[j] // 3`.
