The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the pl.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, w is an integer greater than the current loop counter, ln is an integer, palka is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, shapes is 0, stdin contains 0 input. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the j is the first element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is 0, stdin contains 0 input, j is the first element in the list**
