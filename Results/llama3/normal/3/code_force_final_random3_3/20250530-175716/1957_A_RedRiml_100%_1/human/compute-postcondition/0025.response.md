Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` is empty.**

The code introduces a new variable `shapes` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `palka` is an empty list, `pl` and `d` also remain empty. The stdin is still empty.
