Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value 1 if `d.get(i)` is None, otherwise `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` twice. Otherwise, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` three times. stdin contains 0 input.***
