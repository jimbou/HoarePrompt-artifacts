Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value 1 if `d.get(i)` is None, otherwise `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` twice, stdin contains 0 input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` is still greater than the current loop counter. The value of `ln` remains unchanged. The list `palka` still has at least 2 integers. The value of `shapes` is still a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3. The dictionary `d` still contains the key `i` with a value 1 if `d.get(i)` is None, otherwise `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1. The value of `i` is still the second integer in the list `palka`. The list `pl` now contains the value of `i` twice. There is still no input in stdin.
