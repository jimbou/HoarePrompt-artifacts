Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list with `i` as its last element, `j` is the second last element in the list `pl`, and `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1 or more. Otherwise, `pl` remains an empty list.***
