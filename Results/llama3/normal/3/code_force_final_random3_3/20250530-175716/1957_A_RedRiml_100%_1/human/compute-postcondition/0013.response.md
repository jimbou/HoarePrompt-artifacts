Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first and second elements of `palka` if they were not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least three key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first and second elements in the list `palka` and `i`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, indicating that `i` is now a key in the dictionary `d` with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
