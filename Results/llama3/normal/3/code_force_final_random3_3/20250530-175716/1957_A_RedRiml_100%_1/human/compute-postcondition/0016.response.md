Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first and second elements of `palka` and `i` if they were not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least two key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first and second elements in the list `palka`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). If `d` does not contain `i`, then `d` contains at least three key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first and second elements in the list `palka` and `i`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`). Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `d` is increased by 1.**

The code appends `i` to the list `pl` if it was not already in `pl`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it is assumed to be an integer. The list `pl` now contains the first and second elements of `palka` and `i` if they were not already in `pl`. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged, but its contents are still valid. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
