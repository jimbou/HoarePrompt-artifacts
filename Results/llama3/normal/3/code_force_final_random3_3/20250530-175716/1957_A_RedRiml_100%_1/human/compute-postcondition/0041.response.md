The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and palka, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the palka. If palka has at least 1 integer the loop executes. Before the loop starts, w is an integer greater than the current loop counter, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, shapes is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary d divided by 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. So for the loop to be executed  the list palka must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **w is an integer greater than the current loop counter, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, shapes is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary d divided by 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is the first integer in the list**
