Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from `palka`, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `palka`, `shapes` is 0, and `stdin` contains -1 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in the list `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `palka`, `shapes` is 0 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 1, and `stdin` contains -1 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `palka`, `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `d[j] // 3` if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 1, and `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `d[j] // 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in the list `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `palka`, and `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
