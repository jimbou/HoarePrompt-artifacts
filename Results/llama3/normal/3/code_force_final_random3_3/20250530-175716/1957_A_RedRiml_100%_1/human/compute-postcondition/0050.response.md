The only variable in the loop head is variable  `i` and list `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `palka`.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1 if `d.get(i)` is not None, otherwise `d` is a dictionary with key `i` and value 1, stdin contains 0 input, `i` is the second integer in the list. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i`.**
