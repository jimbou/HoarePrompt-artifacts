Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is the first element in the list `pl`, and stdin contains 0 input.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated to be greater than or equal to 1, as it was incremented by the integer division of the value of `d[j]` by 3. The value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, so the result of the integer division is at least 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
