Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first, second, third elements of `palka` and `i` if they were not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least four key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first, second, third and fourth elements in the list `palka` and `i`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` is set to 1, regardless of its previous value. This means that if `i` was not already a key in `d`, it is now added with a value of 1. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is reset to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
