Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that contains all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements from `palka` and values are their respective counts, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is as follows:

- `w` and `ln` remain unchanged, still being integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `palka` is now an empty list because the loop has iterated over all its elements.
- `pl` contains all unique elements that were in `palka` before the loop started. This is because the loop adds each element from `palka` to `pl` if it's not already there.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that element appeared in `palka`.
- `stdin` is empty because the loop has consumed all the test cases it contained.
