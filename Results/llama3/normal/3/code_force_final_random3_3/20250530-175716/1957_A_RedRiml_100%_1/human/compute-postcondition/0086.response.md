Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with `i` as its last element, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, `j` is the second last element in the list `pl`, and `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1 or more.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been appended to the list `pl`, making it the last element. The value of `j` is now the second last element in the list `pl`. The other variables remain unchanged.
