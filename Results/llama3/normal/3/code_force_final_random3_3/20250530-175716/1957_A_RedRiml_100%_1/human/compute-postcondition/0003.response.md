To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `palka`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `i` is the first element in the list `palka`**
