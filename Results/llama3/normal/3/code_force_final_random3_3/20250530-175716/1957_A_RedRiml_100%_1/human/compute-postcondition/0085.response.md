Postcondition: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d` is updated to include the key `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is increased by 1. The current value of `i` is not in the list `pl`.**
