Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `palka`, `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `d[j] // 3` if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 1, and `stdin` contains -1 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated to be a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to `d[j] // 3` if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise it is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `d[j]` is always 0 since `palka` is an empty list, so `shapes` will always be a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 0.
