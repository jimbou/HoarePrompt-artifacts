Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list that contains the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the list `pl` now contains the first element of `palka`, which is `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each with an integer n followed by n integers.
