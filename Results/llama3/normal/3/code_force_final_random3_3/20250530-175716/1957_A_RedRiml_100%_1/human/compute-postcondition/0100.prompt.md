Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, j is the last element in the list pl, d is an empty dictionary, shapes is not defined, and stdin contains -2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list with `i` as its last element, `j` is the second last element in the list `pl`, and `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1 or more. Otherwise, `pl` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in the list `pl`, then `pl` is a list with `i` repeated as its last two elements, `j` is the second last element in the list `pl`, and if `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d` contains the key `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, if `d` already contains the key `i`, then the value of `i` in `d` is increased by at least 1. If `i` is in the list `pl`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the third element in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain `i` and if `d` does not have `i` as a key, then `d` is updated with `i` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
