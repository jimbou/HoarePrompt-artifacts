Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the number of shapes that can be formed with the given input. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). It then counts the occurrences of each integer, identifies the unique integers, and calculates the number of shapes that can be formed by dividing the count of each unique integer by 3 and summing up the results. Finally, it prints the total number of shapes that can be formed.**
