Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element in the list `palka`), `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), `i` is the first element in the list `palka`***
