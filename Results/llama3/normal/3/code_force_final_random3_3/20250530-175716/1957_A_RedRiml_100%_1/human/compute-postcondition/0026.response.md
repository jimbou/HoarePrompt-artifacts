According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list `pl` must have at least 1 element and `j` is the first element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `j` is the first element in the list**
