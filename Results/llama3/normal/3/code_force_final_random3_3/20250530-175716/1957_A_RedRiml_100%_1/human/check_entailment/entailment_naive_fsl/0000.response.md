Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

4
6
2 2 3 3 3 3

The program outputs 1, but the correct output should be 2. The program only checks for triangles (3 sides) but does not consider other polygons like squares, pentagons, etc.

The program should also consider the case where the number of sticks of the same length is not a multiple of 3, but can still form a polygon with a different number of sides. For example, 4 sticks of the same length can form a square.

The program needs to be modified to consider all possible polygons that can be formed with the given sticks, not just triangles.
