This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a line with an integer n, followed by a line with n integers. It then counts the occurrences of each unique integer in the test case, and calculates the sum of the integer divisions of these counts by 3. The function prints this sum for each test case, effectively determining the maximum number of sets of three identical integers that can be formed from the input integers.
