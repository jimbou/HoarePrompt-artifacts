The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and list `pl`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `pl` has at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and `j` is the third element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary, `j` is the third element in the list `pl`.**
