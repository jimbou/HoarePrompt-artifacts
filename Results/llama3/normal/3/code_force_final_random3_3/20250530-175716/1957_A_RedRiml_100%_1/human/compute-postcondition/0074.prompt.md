Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is 0, stdin contains 0 input.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in the list `pl`, and stdin contains 0 input. If the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`, and stdin contains 0 input. If the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is greater than or equal to 1 plus the integer division of the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` by 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is the third element in the list `pl`, and stdin contains 0 input. If the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is greater than or equal to 1 plus the integer division of the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` by 3 plus the previous value of `shapes`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
