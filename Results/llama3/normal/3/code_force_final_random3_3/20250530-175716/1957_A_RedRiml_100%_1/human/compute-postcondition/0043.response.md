Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with key `i` and value 1, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been updated to include the key `i` with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `shapes` is still a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, but now the sum of the values of the keys in `d` is 1, since `d` only contains the key `i` with value 1.
