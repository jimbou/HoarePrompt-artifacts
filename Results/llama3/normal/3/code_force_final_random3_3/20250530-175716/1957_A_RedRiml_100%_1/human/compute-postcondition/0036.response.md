Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `stdin` is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `w` and `ln` remain unchanged as integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` and `pl` remain empty lists, and `stdin` remains empty. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged. The variable `shapes` is increased by the sum of the integer divisions of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` by 3.
