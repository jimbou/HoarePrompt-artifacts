Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is an integer greater than the current loop counter, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, shapes is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary d divided by 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1 if `d.get(i)` is not None, otherwise `d` is a dictionary with key `i` and value 1, stdin contains 0 input, `i` is the first integer in the list. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value 1 if `d.get(i)` is None, otherwise `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1, `i` is the second integer in the list `palka`, if `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` twice, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value 1 if `d.get(i)` is None, otherwise `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` twice. Otherwise, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` three times. stdin contains 0 input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
