Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value increased by 1, `i` is the third integer in the list `palka`, if `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is a list of integers that contains the value of `i` twice, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `w` is still greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is still an integer, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `shapes` is still a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `i` is still the third integer in the list `palka`, and `pl` remains unchanged. The stdin still contains 0 input.
