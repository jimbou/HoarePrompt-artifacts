To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(w):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `w`. The loop will execute as long as the range generated by `w` has not been exhausted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, the value of `w` must be greater than the current iteration number. Since the current iteration number is not explicitly stated, we can assume it is the current value of the loop counter, which is not explicitly shown in the code snippet. However, we can infer that the loop counter is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the value of `w` must be greater than the current loop counter. Since `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, we can adjust its state to be greater than the current loop counter.

State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `stdin` is empty**
