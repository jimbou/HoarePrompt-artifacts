To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `w` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `w` is at least 1. Since `w` is already an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, we can conclude that `w` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100)**
