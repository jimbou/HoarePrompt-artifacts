The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and list `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and `i` is the second element in the list `palka`.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first and second elements of `palka` if they were not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least two key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first and second elements in the list `palka`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`), `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**
