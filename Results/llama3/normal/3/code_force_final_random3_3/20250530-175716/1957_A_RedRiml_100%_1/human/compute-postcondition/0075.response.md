The code prints the value of the variable `shapes`. However, the value of `shapes` depends on the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d`. If the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integer divisions of the values of the keys in dictionary `d` by 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Since the exact value of `j` and the values of the keys in dictionary `d` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `shapes`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is greater than or equal to the sum of the integer divisions of the values of the keys in dictionary d by 3 if the value of the key j in dictionary d is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged)**
