Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, `i` is the third element in the list `palka`. If `d` does not have `i` as a key, then `d` is updated with `i` as a key and 1 as its value. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.***
