Output State: **`w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`, `shapes` is greater than or equal to 1 plus the integer division of the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` by 3, and `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `j` is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains 0 input.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated by adding the integer division of the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` by 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `d` and `shapes` is only updated if the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3.
