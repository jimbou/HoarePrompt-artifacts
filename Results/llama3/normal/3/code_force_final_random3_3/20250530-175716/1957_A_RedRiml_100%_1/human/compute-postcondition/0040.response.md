Output State: **w is an integer greater than the current loop counter, ln is an integer, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, shapes is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary d divided by 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `ln`, replacing its original value between 1 and 100 inclusive. Then, it assigns a list of integers from the input to `palka`, replacing its original empty state. The third line initializes an empty list `pl`, which remains unchanged. The fourth line initializes an empty dictionary `d`, replacing its original state as a dictionary with some keys and values. The value of `shapes` is still a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, but since `d` is now empty, the sum of its keys is 0, making `shapes` a multiple of 0, which is 0. The stdin is left with one input: a space-separated list of integers.
