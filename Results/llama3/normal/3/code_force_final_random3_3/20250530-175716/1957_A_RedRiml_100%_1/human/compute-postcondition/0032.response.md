Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`. If the value of the key `j` in the dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is increased by the value of the key `j` in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged.***
