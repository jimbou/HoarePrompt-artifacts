Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary, `stdin` is empty, and `j` is the first element in the list `pl`. If the value of the key `j` in the dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is a multiple of the value of the key `j` in the dictionary `d` divided by 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
