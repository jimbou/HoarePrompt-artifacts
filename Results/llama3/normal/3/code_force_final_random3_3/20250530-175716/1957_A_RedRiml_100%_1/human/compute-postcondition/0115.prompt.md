Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += d[j] // 3
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary, `shapes` is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `shapes` which is a multiple of the sum of the values of the keys in the dictionary `d` divided by 3 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, and stdin contains 0 input. If the value of the key `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integer divisions of the values of the keys in dictionary `d` by 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. and the value of `shapes` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is an integer greater than the current loop counter plus one, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from `palka`, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `palka`, `shapes` is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `stdin` contains -1 inputs, and the number of shapes is printed, where the number of shapes is a multiple of 3 greater than or equal to the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
