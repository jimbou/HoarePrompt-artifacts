Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that contains the first, second, third elements of `palka` and `i` if they were not already in `pl`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains `i` and `d` contains `i` with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value associated with `i` in `d` is increased by 1. `d` is a dictionary that contains at least three key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first, second and third elements in the list `palka`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`). If `d` does not contain `i`, then `d` contains at least four key-value pairs where the key is `i` (the first, second, third and fourth elements in the list `palka` and `i`) and the value is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or increased by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`). `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).***
