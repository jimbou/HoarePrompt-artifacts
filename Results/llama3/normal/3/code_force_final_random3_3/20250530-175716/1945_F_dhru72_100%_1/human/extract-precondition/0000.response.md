Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 200,000). The second line contains a list of n integers (1 <= v_i <= 10^9) representing the magic powers of the mushrooms. The third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n.**
