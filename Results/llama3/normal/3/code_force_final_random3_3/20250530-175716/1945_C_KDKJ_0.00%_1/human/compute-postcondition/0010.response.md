Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and `a` remains the same. The list `S` also remains the same. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the last two elements of the list `S`. Since the second character in the string `a` is either '0' or not '0', the values of `x` and `y` are either 1 and 0 or 0 and 1, respectively. The `stdin` remains empty.
