Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y+1` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 1, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y+1` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y+1` is either 1 or 2, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and the string `a` remain the same. The list `S` still contains two lists, but the second list now contains `x` and `y+1`. The value of `x` is still either 0 or 1, but the value of `y+1` is now either 1 or 2, depending on the second character of the string `a`. The stdin remains empty.
