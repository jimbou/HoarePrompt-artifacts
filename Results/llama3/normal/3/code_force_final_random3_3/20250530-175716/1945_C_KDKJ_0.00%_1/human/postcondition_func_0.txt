This function reads two inputs from the standard input: an integer n and a string a of length n consisting only of 0 and 1. It then calculates the cumulative count of 0s and 1s in the string a and stores it in a list S. The function then iterates through the list S to find the index i that minimizes the absolute difference between n/2 and i, while ensuring that the number of 0s and 1s on both sides of the index i are roughly balanced. Finally, the function prints the index i that satisfies these conditions.
