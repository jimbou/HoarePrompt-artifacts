Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y where x is the number of '0' characters in the string a up to that point and y is the number of '1' characters in the string a up to that point, ans is 0, satisfy is 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y` where `x` is the number of '0' characters in the string `a` up to that point and `y` is the number of '1' characters in the string `a` up to that point, `ans` is either its original value or `i`, `satisfy` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `left` is the number of '0' characters in the string `a` up to the current point `i`, `lsum` is the total number of characters in the string `a` up to the current point `i`, `right` is the number of '1' characters in the string `a` from the current point `i` to the end, `rsum` is the total number of characters in the string `a` from the current point `i` to the end. If either `left` is less than half of `lsum` or `right` is less than half of `rsum`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, `left` is greater than or equal to half of `lsum` and `right` is greater than or equal to half of `rsum`, and the value of `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n/2` and `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y` where `x` is the number of '0' characters in the string `a` up to that point and `y` is the number of '1' characters in the string `a` up to that point, `ans` is either its original value or `i`, `satisfy` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `left` is the number of '0' characters in the string `a` up to the current point `i`, `lsum` is the total number of characters in the string `a` up to the current point `i`, `right` is the number of '1' characters in the string `a` from the current point `i` to the end, `rsum` is the total number of characters in the string `a` from the current point `i` to the end. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n/2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y where x is the number of '0' characters in the string a up to that point and y is the number of '1' characters in the string a up to that point, stdin is empty, i is 2, left is the number of '0' characters in the string a up to the current point i, lsum is the total number of characters in the string a up to the current point i, right is the number of '1' characters in the string a from the current point i to the end, rsum is the total number of characters in the string a from the current point i to the end. If left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum, then ans is either its original value or 2 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n/2 and i is less than or equal to the absolute difference between n/2 and ans, then ans is 2 and satisfy is 0. Otherwise, ans retains its original value and satisfy remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
