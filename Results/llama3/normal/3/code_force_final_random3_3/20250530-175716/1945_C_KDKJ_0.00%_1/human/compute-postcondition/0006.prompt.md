Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: first an integer (the number of houses) and then a string of 0s and 1s (the preferences of the residents).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The function `func_1()` has been executed, and its return value is returned. `stdin` contains a sequence of test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The return value of `func_1()` has been returned, `stdin` contains at least one more integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `func_1()` has been returned, `stdin` contains at least one more integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
