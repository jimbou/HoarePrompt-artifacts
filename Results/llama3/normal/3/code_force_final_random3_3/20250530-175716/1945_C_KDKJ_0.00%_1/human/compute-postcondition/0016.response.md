Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing three lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 1, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y+1` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `y` is either 0 or 1, `y+1` is either 1 or 2, the third list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, `s` is the second character in the string `a`, `x` and `y` are assigned the last two elements of the list `S`, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `a`, `S`, `s`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the last two elements of the list `S`, which are either (1, 1) or (0, 2) depending on the second character of the string `a`.
