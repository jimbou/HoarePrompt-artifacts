Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 1 character, `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the first character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, if the first character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `n` and `a` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `S` now contains two lists: the first list is the same as in the initial state, and the second list contains the values of `x` and `y` which are determined by the first character of the string `a`. If the first character of `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, otherwise `x` is 0 and `y` is 1. The `stdin` is still empty.
