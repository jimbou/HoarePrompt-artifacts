Output State: **`func_1()` has been returned, `stdin` contains at least one more integer**.

In this case, the code simply calls the function `func_1()` but does not assign its return value to any variable. The state of the program remains the same as the initial state, with `func_1()` still having been returned and `stdin` still containing at least one more integer.
