Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing four lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 1, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y+1` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `y` is either 0 or 1, `y+1` is either 1 or 2, the third list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, the fourth list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `y` is either 0 or 1. If the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `y` is either 1 or 2. In both cases, `y+1` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `s` is the second character in the string `a`, `x` and `y` are assigned the last two elements of the list `S`, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `S` now contains four lists. The first three lists remain the same as before. The fourth list contains the values of `x` and `y`, which are assigned the last two elements of the list `S`. The values of `x` and `y` depend on the second character in the string `a`. If the second character is '0', then `x` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `y` is either 0 or 1. If the second character is not '0', then `x` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `y` is either 1 or 2. In both cases, `y+1` is either 1, 2, or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
