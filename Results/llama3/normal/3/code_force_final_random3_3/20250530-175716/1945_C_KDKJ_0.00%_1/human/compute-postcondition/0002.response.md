To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and understand how the loop condition is affected by the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. Here, the variable `_` is a throwaway variable that takes the value of each iteration in the range but is not used within the loop body. The key components are `range` and `int(input())`.

1. `int(input())`: This function reads input from `stdin`, converts it to an integer, and returns it. The state of `stdin` changes after each call to `input()` because it consumes the input. For the loop to execute again, there must be another integer available in `stdin`.

2. `range(...)`: This function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the number provided by `int(input())`. The state of the loop iteration is determined by the current position in this sequence.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- The function `func_1()` has been executed, and its return value is returned. This information is not directly relevant to the loop condition but indicates that some external function has been called and completed.

- `stdin` contains a sequence of test cases. This implies that there are multiple inputs available for the loop to process.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:

- Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its state does not affect the loop condition.
- For `range(int(input()))`, the loop will execute again if there is another integer available in `stdin`. Thus, the state of `stdin` must be that it contains at least one more integer.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`func_1()` has been executed, and its return value is returned, `stdin` contains at least one more integer.**

Note that the specifics of `func_1()` and its return value are not relevant to the loop condition itself but are part of the overall program state.
