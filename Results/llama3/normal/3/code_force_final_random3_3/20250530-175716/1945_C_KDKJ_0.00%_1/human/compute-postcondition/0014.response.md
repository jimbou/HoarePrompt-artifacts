Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing three lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the first character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the first character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the first character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 1, if the first character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y+1` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `y` is either 0 or 1, `y+1` is either 1 or 2, the third list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the first character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and `a` remains the same. The list `S` now contains three lists. The first two lists are the same as before, but the third list is a copy of the second list, with `x` and `y` updated according to the first character of the string `a`. If the first character of `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1 in the third list. If the first character of `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2 in the third list. The values of `x`, `y`, and `y+1` are still constrained to be either 0, 1, or 2. The `stdin` is still empty.
