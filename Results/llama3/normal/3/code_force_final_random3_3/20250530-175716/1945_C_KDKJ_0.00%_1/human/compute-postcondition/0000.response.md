To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if there is at least one integer input from `stdin` that can be converted to an integer using `int(input())`. This integer represents the number of test cases.

Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains two inputs: the number of test cases and the sequence of test cases. For the loop to execute, the number of test cases must be at least 1.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one integer input (the number of test cases) which is greater than 0, and a sequence of test cases**
