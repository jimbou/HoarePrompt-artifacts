Output State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed for the number of test cases specified in the initial state, and its return value is returned. `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will continue to execute the function `func_1()` for each test case specified in the initial state, until all test cases have been processed. After the loop finishes executing, the function `func_1()` will have been executed for the specified number of test cases, and its return value will be returned. The `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
