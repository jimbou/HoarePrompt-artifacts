Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing a single list with two elements: 0 and 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for s in a:
    x, y = S[-1]
    if s == '0':
        x += 1
    else:
        y += 1
    S.append([x, y])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 1 character, `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the first character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, if the first character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing three lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the first character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the first character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the first character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 1, if the first character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y+1` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `y` is either 0 or 1, `y+1` is either 1 or 2, the third list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the first character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the first character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1 and must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing four lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 1, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y+1` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `y` is either 0 or 1, `y+1` is either 1 or 2, the third list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, the fourth list contains two elements: `x` and `y` where if the second character in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `y` is either 0 or 1. If the second character in the string `a` is not '0', then `x` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `y` is either 1 or 2. In both cases, `y+1` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `s` is the second character in the string `a`, `x` and `y` are assigned the last two elements of the list `S`, `stdin` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
