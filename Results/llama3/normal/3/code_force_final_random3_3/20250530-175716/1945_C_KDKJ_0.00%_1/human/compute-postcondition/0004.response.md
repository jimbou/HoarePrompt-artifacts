To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` (a throwaway variable), `int(input())`, and `stdin` (the standard input stream).

At the end of the previous iteration, `func_1()` has been returned, and `stdin` contains at least one more integer.

To execute the loop again, we need to consider the following:

* `_` is a throwaway variable, so its value doesn't matter.
* `int(input())` needs to be re-evaluated to get the next integer from `stdin`.
* `stdin` needs to contain at least one more integer for the loop to execute again.

Since `func_1()` has been returned, its state is not relevant to the loop. The only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `stdin`, which needs to contain at least one more integer.

State: **`func_1()` has been returned, `stdin` contains at least one more integer**
