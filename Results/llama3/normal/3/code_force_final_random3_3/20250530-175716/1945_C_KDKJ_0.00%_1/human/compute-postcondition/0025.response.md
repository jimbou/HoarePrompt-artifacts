Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y where x is the number of '0' characters in the string a up to that point and y is the number of '1' characters in the string a up to that point, ans is 0, satisfy is 0, stdin is empty, i is 0, the current value of left is the number of '0' characters in the string a up to the current point i, the current value of lsum is the total number of characters in the string a up to the current point i, the current value of right is the number of '1' characters in the string a from the current point i to the end, the current value of rsum is the total number of characters in the string a from the current point i to the end. Either the current value of left is less than half of the current value of lsum or the current value of right is less than half of the current value of rsum***
