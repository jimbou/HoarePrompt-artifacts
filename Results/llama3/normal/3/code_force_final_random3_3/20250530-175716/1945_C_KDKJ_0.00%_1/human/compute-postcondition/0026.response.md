Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y` where `x` is the number of '0' characters in the string `a` up to that point and `y` is the number of '1' characters in the string `a` up to that point, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `left` is the number of '0' characters in the string `a` up to the current point `i`, `lsum` is the total number of characters in the string `a` up to the current point `i`, `right` is the number of '1' characters in the string `a` from the current point `i` to the end, `rsum` is the total number of characters in the string `a` from the current point `i` to the end, and either `left` is less than half of `lsum` or `right` is less than half of `rsum`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
