Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. Either `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`. Additionally, either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not greater than `b`. If `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`, the value of the expression 2 + m // a is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is being printed.***
