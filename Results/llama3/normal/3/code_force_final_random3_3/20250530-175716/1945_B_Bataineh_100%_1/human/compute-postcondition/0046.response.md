Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the number 2 is printed. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (exclusive), the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a`. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `b`, plus 2.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the last values read from the input. The loop has finished executing, and the program has printed the results for all input cases. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
