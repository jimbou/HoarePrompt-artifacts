Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b` is printed. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (exclusive), then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `m` divided by `a` plus `m` divided by `b` plus 2 is printed.***
