Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. Either `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`. Additionally, either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not greater than `b`. The current value of `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`, and the value of the expression 2 + m // a is being printed**
