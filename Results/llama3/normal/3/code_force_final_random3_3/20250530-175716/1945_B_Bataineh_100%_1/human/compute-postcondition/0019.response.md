Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the number 2 is printed. If `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the value of the expression 2 plus the integer division of `m` by the smaller of `a` and `b` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2 is printed.***
