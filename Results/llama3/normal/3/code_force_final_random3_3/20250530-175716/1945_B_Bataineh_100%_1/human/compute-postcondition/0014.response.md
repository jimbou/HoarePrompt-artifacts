Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers. Either `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`. Additionally, either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not greater than `b`. Either `m` is not less than `b` or `m` is not greater than `a`.***
