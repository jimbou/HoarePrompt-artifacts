Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make both a and b greater than or equal to m. The operations considered are adding a or b to themselves, and the function prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly to standard output.**
