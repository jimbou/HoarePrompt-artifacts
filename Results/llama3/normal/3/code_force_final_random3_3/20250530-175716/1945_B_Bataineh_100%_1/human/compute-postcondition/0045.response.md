Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the number 2 is printed. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (exclusive), the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a`. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `b`, plus 2.***
