To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
