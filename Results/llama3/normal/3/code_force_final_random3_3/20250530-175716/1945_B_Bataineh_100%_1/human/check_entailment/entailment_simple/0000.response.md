Reasoning:

The program correctly handles the different cases based on the relationship between `m` and `a` and `b`. 

- If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it means that the fireworks from the same installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2, one from each installation.

- If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, it means that the fireworks from the first installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time, but the fireworks from the second installation can be visible in the sky at the same time. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2 plus the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible in the sky at the same time, which is `m // b`.

- If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, it is similar to the previous case, but for the first installation. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2 plus the number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible in the sky at the same time, which is `m // a`.

- If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, it means that the fireworks from both installations can be visible in the sky at the same time. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is the sum of the number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible in the sky at the same time, which is `m // a`, the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible in the sky at the same time, which is `m // b`, plus 2.

Correctness: **True**
