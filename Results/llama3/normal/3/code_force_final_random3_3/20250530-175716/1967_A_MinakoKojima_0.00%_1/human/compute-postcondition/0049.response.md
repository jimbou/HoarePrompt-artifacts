The code `k -= n * m` subtracts the product of `n` and `m` from `k`. Since `n` and `m` are integers, the result of `n * m` is also an integer. Therefore, `k` is decreased by an integer value.

The values of the other variables (`a`, `ans`, `_`, and `i`) are not affected by this code. The stdin still contains at least one input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer decreased by `n * m`, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is undefined, stdin contains at least one input**
