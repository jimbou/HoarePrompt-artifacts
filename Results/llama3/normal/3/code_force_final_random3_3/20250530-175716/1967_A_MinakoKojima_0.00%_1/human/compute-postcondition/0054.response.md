The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer decreased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is increased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least one input**
