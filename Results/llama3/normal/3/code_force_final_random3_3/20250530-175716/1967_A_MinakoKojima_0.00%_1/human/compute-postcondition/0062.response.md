To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `k` is an integer decreased by n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is increased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1]) * (a[i] - a[i - 1]), `_` is 0, `i` is 3, stdin contains at least one input**
