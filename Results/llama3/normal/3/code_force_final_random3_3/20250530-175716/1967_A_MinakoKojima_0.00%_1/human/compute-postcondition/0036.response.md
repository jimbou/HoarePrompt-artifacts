The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[i]` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`) for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the minimum value in list `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains no inputs**
