The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the integer value of the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 or 2 inputs. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again stdin must contain at least 1 input.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is an integer, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 input**
