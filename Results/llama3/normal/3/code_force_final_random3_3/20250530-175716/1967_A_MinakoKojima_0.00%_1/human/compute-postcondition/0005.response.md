Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be a negative integer, since it is decreased by `n * m`, which is a positive value (as `n` and `m` are both integers). The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs.
