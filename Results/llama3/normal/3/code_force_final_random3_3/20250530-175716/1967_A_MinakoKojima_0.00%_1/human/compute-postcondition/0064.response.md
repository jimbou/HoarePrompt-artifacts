Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `k` is an integer decreased by n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is increased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]), `_` is 0, `i` is n, stdin contains at least one input**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` is at least 0, `k` has been decreased by `n` times the minimum of `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` has been increased by the minimum of `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]`, `m` remains an integer, `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `_` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and stdin contains at least one input.
