Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[i]` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`) for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the minimum value in list `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, stdin contains no inputs**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum value in list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
