Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[i]` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`) for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the product of the minimum value in list `a`, the difference between the second and first elements in list `a`, the difference between the third and second elements in list `a`, and the difference between the fourth and third elements in list `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, stdin contains no inputs**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the fourth and third elements in list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
