The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer decreased by n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is increased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1]), `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least one input**
