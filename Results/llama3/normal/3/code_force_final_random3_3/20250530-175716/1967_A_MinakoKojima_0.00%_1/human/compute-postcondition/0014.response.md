The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is a negative integer, `a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer, `ans` is `m + k`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input.**
