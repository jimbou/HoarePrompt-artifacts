Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is an integer, _ is 0, i is an integer, stdin contains at least one input. If k is greater than or equal to n times m, then ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, k is decreased by n times the minimum of k and m plus k divided by n minus the ith element of a, a's ith element is increased by the minimum of k and m plus k divided by n minus the ith element of a, and ans is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of a, and the value of ans is being printed**
