Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs**

The code reads two inputs from stdin, assigning the first input to `n` and the second input to `k`. Then, it reads another input, a list of integers, and assigns it to `a`. The minimum value in the list `a` is assigned to `m`. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. After executing the code, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the two inputs that were read.
