To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the range function.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2 inputs.**
