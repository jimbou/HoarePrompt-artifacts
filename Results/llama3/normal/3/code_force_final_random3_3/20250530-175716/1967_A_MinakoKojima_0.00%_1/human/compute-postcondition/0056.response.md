Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer decreased by n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), a is a list of integers where a[i] is increased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is an integer, ans is 0, _ is 0, i is n, stdin contains at least one input**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

* `n` remains an integer, but its value is not changed by the loop.
* `k` is decreased by the total amount of `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all iterations, which is `n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
* `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is increased by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all iterations.
* `m` remains an integer, but its value is not changed by the loop.
* `ans` remains 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
* `_` remains 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
* `i` is equal to `n`, as the loop iterates `n` times.
* `stdin` still contains at least one input, as the loop does not modify the input.
