The code `ans = math.factorial(n)` assigns the factorial of `n` to `ans`. The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer, the factorial of `n` is also an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer, `ans` is the factorial of `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is undefined, stdin contains at least one input**
