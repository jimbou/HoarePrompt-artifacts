Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 or 2 inputs. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is at least 0, k is a negative integer, a is a list of integers with a[i] updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), ans is (m + k) * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]), and ans is printed**
