Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is a negative integer, a is a list of integers with a[i] updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), m is an integer, ans is 0, _ is 0, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains a negative integer, the list `a` has all its elements updated according to the loop's body for all indices from 0 to `n-1`, `m` remains unchanged, `ans` and `_` remain 0, `i` is now `n-1` (since the loop iterates `n` times), and there is 1 input left in stdin.
