Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer decreased by n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is increased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to a[0], `_` is 0, `i` is n, stdin contains at least one input**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the list `a`, which is `a[0]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains at least one input.
