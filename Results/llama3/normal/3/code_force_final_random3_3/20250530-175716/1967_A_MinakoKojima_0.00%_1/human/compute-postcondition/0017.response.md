Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is a negative integer, `a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer, `ans` is `(m + k) * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one input has been consumed.
