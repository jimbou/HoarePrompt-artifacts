Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains no inputs**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been updated to be the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no inputs.
