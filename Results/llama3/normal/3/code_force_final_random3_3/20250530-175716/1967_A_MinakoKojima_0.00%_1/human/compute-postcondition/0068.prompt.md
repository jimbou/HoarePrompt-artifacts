Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 or 2 inputs. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is at least 0, k is a negative integer, a is a list of integers with a[i] updated to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), ans is (m + k) * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]), and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers read from the input, m is an integer equal to the minimum value in list a, ans is the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m. Otherwise, n is at least n, k is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list a minus the sum of the minimum values between k and m + k // n - a[i] for all i in range(n), a is a list of integers read from the input where a[i] is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), m is an integer equal to the minimum value in list a, ans is the product of the minimum value in list a and the differences between consecutive elements in list a, _ is 1, i is n - 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is an integer, _ is 0, i is an integer, stdin contains at least one input. If k is greater than or equal to n times m, then ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, k is decreased by n times the minimum of k and m plus k divided by n minus the ith element of a, a's ith element is increased by the minimum of k and m plus k divided by n minus the ith element of a, and ans is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of a, and the value of ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
