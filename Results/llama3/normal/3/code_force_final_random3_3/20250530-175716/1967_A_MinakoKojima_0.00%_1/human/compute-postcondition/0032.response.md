The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a` minus the minimum value between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[i]` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains no inputs**
