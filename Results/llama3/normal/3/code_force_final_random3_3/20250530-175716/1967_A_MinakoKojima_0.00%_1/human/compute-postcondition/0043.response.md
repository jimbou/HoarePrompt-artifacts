Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers read from the input, m is an integer equal to the minimum value in list a, ans is the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m. Otherwise, n is at least n, k is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list a minus the sum of the minimum values between k and m + k // n - a[i] for all i in range(n), a is a list of integers read from the input where a[i] is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for all i in range(n), m is an integer equal to the minimum value in list a, ans is the product of the minimum value in list a and the differences between consecutive elements in list a, _ is 1, i is n - 1, stdin contains no inputs***
