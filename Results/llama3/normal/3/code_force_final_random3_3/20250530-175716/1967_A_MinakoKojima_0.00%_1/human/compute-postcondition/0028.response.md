The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the first input integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains no inputs**
