Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer decreased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), a is a list of integers where a[i] is increased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is an integer, ans is 0, _ is 0, i is 1, stdin contains at least one input**

The code block modifies the values of `a[i]` and `k`. The first line increases the value of `a[i]` by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, and the second line decreases the value of `k` by the same amount. The other variables remain unchanged.
