Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[i]` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`) for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the minimum value in list `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, stdin contains no inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[i]` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`) for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the product of the minimum value in list `a` and the difference between the second and first elements in list `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains no inputs

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[i]` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`) for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the product of the minimum value in list `a`, the difference between the second and first elements in list `a`, and the difference between the third and second elements in list `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains no inputs

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the minimum value in list `a` minus the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input where `a[i]` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`) for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer equal to the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the product of the minimum value in list `a`, the difference between the second and first elements in list `a`, the difference between the third and second elements in list `a`, and the difference between the fourth and third elements in list `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, stdin contains no inputs




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
