Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `k` is an integer decreased by n * min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `a` is a list of integers where a[i] is increased by min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1]) * (a[i] - a[i - 1]) * (a[i] - a[i - 1]), `_` is 0, `i` is 3, stdin contains at least one input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been multiplied by the difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
