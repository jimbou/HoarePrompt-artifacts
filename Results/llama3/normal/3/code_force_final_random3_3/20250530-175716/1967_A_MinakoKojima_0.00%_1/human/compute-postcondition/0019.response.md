Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `k` is a negative integer, `a` is a list of integers with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer, `ans` is `(m + k) * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * (a[3] - a[2])`, `_` is 0, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one input has been consumed.
