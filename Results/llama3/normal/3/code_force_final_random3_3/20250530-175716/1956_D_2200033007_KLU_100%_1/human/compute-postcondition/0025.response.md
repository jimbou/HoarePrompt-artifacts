The only variables in the loop head are variable  j, start_index and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `start_index` and `i`. If `j` is less than `start_index + i + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer such that `start_index <= j <= start_index + i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, and `i` is a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be `start_index + i`, `start_index` must be a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 2`, and `i` must be a positive integer greater than 1.
State: **`i` is a positive integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is now `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 2`, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is `start_index + i`**
