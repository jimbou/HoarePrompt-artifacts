Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is an integer such that `i` <= `j` <= `i`, and `i` is not equal to 0. The current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, `is_already_stairs`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`, which means that the function will be executed with the value of `i` decremented by 1.
