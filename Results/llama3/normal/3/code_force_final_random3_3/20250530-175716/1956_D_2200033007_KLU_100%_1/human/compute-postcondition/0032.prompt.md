You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, and res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers.

Additionally, `is_already_stairs` is True, indicating that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j` for some `j` in range(`i` + 1).

If the current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is 0, the value at index `j` in `arr` is now 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, the tuple (`start_index`, `start_index` + `i`) has been appended to `res`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called and returned.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the program remains unchanged, with `i` being a non-negative integer, `arr` being a list of integers, `start_index` being a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` being a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` being True, and `j` being an integer such that `i` + 1 <= `j` <= `i` + 1. Additionally, `is_already_stairs` is True, indicating that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j` for some `j` in range(`i` + 1).

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the variables remains unchanged: i is 0, arr is a list of integers with the element at start_index changed to 1, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended, is_already_stairs is False, and j is an integer such that 1 <= j <= 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
