Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, is_already_stairs is False, j is an integer such that i + 1 <= j <= i + 1, and i is not equal to 0. The value at arr[start_index + i] is not equal to i. The function make_stairs(i - 1) has been called. The tuple (start_index, start_index + i) has been appended to res.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
    arr[j] = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is now `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is an integer such that `start_index <= j <= start_index + i`, and the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` has been appended to `res`. The value at `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is a positive integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is now `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 2`, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is `start_index + i`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is a positive integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is now `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 2`, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is `start_index + i + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
