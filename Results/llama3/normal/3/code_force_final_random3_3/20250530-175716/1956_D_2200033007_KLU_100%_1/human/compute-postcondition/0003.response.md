Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= `j` <= `i`. The current value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `is_already_stairs` has been updated to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` and its elements, the index `start_index`, the list `res`, and the integer `j` are still the same as before. The relationship between `start_index` and the length of `arr` is still valid, and the value of `arr[start_index + j]` is still not equal to `j`.
