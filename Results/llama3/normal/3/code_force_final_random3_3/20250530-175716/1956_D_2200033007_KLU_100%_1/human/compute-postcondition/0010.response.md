Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer + 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is an integer such that 2 <= `j` <= `i` + 1. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, the state of `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged.***
