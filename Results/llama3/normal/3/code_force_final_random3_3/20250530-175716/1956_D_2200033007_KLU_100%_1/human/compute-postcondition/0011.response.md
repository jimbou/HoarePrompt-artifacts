Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` for any `j` in range(`i` + 1), otherwise `is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is an integer such that `i` + 1 <= `j` <= `i` + 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `start_index` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and `is_already_stairs` is set to False if any element in the subarray of `arr` starting at `start_index` and of length `i` + 1 is not equal to its index in that subarray, otherwise `is_already_stairs` remains True. The loop variable `j` is set to `i` + 1.
