Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a solution to the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r, computing the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray from l to r, and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX.

The program uses a recursive approach with memoization to find the maximum sum that can be achieved. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum sum for a given subarray, and the function `func_2` constructs the sequence of operations to achieve this maximum sum.

The program also includes a function `make_stairs` to create a "staircase" of values in the array, which is used to achieve the maximum sum.

After analyzing the program, I did not find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles the base cases, and the recursive approach with memoization ensures that the maximum sum is calculated correctly.

The program also correctly constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum, and the `make_stairs` function is used correctly to create the staircase of values.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
