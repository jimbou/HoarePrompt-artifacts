To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is at least 0. Since `i` is already a non-negative integer, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure it can take values from 0 to `i`.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is True, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= `j` <= `i`**
