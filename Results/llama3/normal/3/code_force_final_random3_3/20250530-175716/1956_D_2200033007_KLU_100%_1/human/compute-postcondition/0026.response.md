Output State: **`i` is a positive integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is now `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 2`, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is `start_index + i`**

The value of `arr[j]` is updated to `i`, which is a positive integer greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now has the value `i` at index `j`, which is equal to `start_index + i`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and conditions.
