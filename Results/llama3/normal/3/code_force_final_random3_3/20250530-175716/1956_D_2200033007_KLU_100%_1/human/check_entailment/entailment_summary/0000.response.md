Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where we need to maximize the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, computing x as MEX({a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}), and simultaneously setting a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, ..., a_r:=x.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and make_stairs. 

func_1 calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by performing the operation on a subarray of a given list of non-negative integers. It uses dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

func_2 takes a list of integers and two indices as input and calculates the maximum value of a subarray within the given range using func_1. It then constructs a "stair" using the make_stairs function and returns a list containing a tuple of start_index and end_index.

make_stairs transforms a given list of integers into a "staircase" structure by modifying the list in-place and appending tuples to a result list.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements. It calculates the maximum sum of elements that can be obtained by performing the operation and constructs a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. The program also ensures that the number of operations does not exceed 5 * 10^5.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
