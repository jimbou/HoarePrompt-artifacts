Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is now `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is an integer such that `start_index <= j <= start_index + i`, and the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` has been appended to `res`. The value at `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[j]` has been updated to `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `start_index`, `j`, and the tuple in `res` are still valid.
