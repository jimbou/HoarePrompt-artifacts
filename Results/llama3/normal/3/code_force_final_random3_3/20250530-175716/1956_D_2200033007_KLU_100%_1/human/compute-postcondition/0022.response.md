Output State: **i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, is_already_stairs is False, j is an integer such that i + 1 <= j <= i + 1, and i is not equal to 0. The value at arr[start_index + i] is not equal to i. The function make_stairs(i - 1) has been called. The tuple (start_index, start_index + i) has been appended to res.**

In this output state, the function make_stairs(i - 1) has been called, which may have modified some variables or performed some actions, but its specific effects are not specified in the given code snippet. The tuple (start_index, start_index + i) has been added to the list res. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
