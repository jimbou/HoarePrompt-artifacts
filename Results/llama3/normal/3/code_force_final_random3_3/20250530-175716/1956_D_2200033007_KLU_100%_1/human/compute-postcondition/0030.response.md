Output State: **`i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is now 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is `start_index` + `i`, the tuple (`start_index`, `start_index` + `i`) has been appended to `res`, the value at `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called and returned.**

In this output state, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called and returned, but the values of the variables `i`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, `is_already_stairs`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The function call has not changed the values of these variables.
