To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. `j` is the loop variable, and its range is defined by `start_index` and `start_index + i + 1`. For the loop to execute, `j` must have a valid range, meaning `start_index` must be less than `start_index + i + 1`. Since `i` is a non-negative integer, this condition is always true.


2. `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`. This condition ensures that `start_index` is within the bounds of the array `arr`. For the loop to execute, `start_index` must be less than `start_index + i + 1`, which is always true since `i` is non-negative.


3. `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 <= j <= i + 1`. This condition seems to imply that `j` is equal to `i + 1`, but this is not possible since `j` ranges from `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1`. Therefore, we can conclude that `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.


Based on these adjustments, the updated state is:


State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is an integer such that `start_index <= j <= start_index + i`, and the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` has been appended to `res`. The value at `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**
