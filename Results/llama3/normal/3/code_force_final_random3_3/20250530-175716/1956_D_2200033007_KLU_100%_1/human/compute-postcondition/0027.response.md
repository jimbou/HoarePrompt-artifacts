To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `start_index + i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `start_index + i`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be `start_index + i + 1`.

Since `i` is a positive integer greater than 1, we can increment `i` by 1 to make the loop execute again.

The value of `start_index` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`i` is a positive integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is now `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 2`, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is `start_index + i + 1**
