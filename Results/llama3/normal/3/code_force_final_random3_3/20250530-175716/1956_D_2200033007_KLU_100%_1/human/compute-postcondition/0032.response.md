Functionality: **This function transforms a given list of integers into a "staircase" structure by modifying the list in-place and appending tuples to a result list. It takes four parameters: a non-negative integer `i`, a list of integers `arr`, a non-negative integer `start_index` within the bounds of `arr`, and a list of tuples `res`. The function checks if the sub-list of `arr` starting at `start_index` with length `i+1` is already a staircase (i.e., each element is equal to its index). If it is, the function returns without modifying the list or result. If `i` is 0, the function appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to `res` and sets the element at `start_index` in `arr` to 1. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with `i-1` and, if the current element at `start_index + i` is not equal to `i`, appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to `res` and sets all elements in the range `[start_index, start_index + i]` in `arr` to `i`. The function does not return any value explicitly, but modifies the input list and result list in-place.**
