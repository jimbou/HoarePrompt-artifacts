Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the variables remains unchanged: i is 0, arr is a list of integers with the element at start_index changed to 1, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended, is_already_stairs is False, and j is an integer such that 1 <= j <= 1.**
