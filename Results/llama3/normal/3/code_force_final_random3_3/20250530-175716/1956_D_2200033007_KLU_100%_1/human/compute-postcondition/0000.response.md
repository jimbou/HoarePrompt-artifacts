Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is True.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `res` remain unchanged, as the code only introduces a new variable `is_already_stairs` and assigns it the value True. The relationship between `start_index` and the length of `arr` minus `i` minus 1 is still valid.
