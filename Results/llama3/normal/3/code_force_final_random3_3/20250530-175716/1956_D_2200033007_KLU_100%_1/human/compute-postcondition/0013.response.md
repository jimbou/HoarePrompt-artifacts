Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the program remains unchanged, with `i` being a non-negative integer, `arr` being a list of integers, `start_index` being a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` being a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` being True, and `j` being an integer such that `i` + 1 <= `j` <= `i` + 1. Additionally, `is_already_stairs` is True, indicating that `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j` for some `j` in range(`i` + 1).**
