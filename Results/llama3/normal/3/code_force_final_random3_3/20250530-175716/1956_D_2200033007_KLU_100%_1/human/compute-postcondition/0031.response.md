Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is an integer such that `i` + 1 <= `j` <= `i` + 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If the current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is 0, the value at index `j` in `arr` is now 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, the tuple (`start_index`, `start_index` + `i`) has been appended to `res`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called and returned.***
