Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

 Output hints for function1:  This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by performing certain operations on a subarray of a given list of non-negative integers. It takes three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `arr`, and two non-negative integers `start_index` and `end_index` such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(`arr`). The function returns the maximum value between the square of the difference between `end_index` and `start_index` plus 1, the sum of the results of recursive calls to the function for subarrays, and the sum of the value at the start or end index and the result of a recursive call for the remaining subarray. If the result for the given `start_index` and `end_index` is already calculated, it returns the stored value.

 Output hints for function2:  This function takes a list of integers `arr` and two indices `start_index` and `end_index` as input, where `0 <= start_index <= end_index < len(arr)`. It calculates the maximum value of a subarray within the given range using the `func_1` function and checks if the length of the subarray is 1. If the length is 1 and the value at `start_index` is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list. If the maximum value is equal to the square of the length, it constructs a "stair" using the `make_stairs` function and returns a list containing a tuple of `start_index` and `end_index`. Otherwise, it iterates through the subarray to find a value that, when combined with the maximum values of the subarrays before and after it, equals the maximum value. If such a value is found, it returns the sum of the results of `func_2` applied to the subarrays before and after the value. If no such value is found, it takes no specific action.

 Output hints for function3:  This function transforms a given list of integers into a "staircase" structure by modifying the list in-place and appending tuples to a result list. It takes four parameters: a non-negative integer `i`, a list of integers `arr`, a non-negative integer `start_index` within the bounds of `arr`, and a list of tuples `res`. The function checks if the sub-list of `arr` starting at `start_index` with length `i+1` is already a staircase (i.e., each element is equal to its index). If it is, the function returns without modifying the list or result. If `i` is 0, the function appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to `res` and sets the element at `start_index` in `arr` to 1. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with `i-1` and, if the current element at `start_index + i` is not equal to `i`, appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to `res` and sets all elements in the range `[start_index, start_index + i]` in `arr` to `i`. The function does not return any value explicitly, but modifies the input list and result list in-place.
