#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by performing certain operations on a subarray of a given list of non-negative integers. It takes three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `arr`, and two non-negative integers `start_index` and `end_index` such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(`arr`). The function returns the maximum value between the square of the difference between `end_index` and `start_index` plus 1, the sum of the results of recursive calls to the function for subarrays, and the sum of the value at the start or end index and the result of a recursive call for the remaining subarray. If the result for the given `start_index` and `end_index` is already calculated, it returns the stored value.

If the length is 1 and the value at `start_index` is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list. If the maximum value is equal to the square of the length, it constructs a "stair" using the `make_stairs` function and returns a list containing a tuple of `start_index` and `end_index`. Otherwise, it iterates through the subarray to find a value that, when combined with the maximum values of the subarrays before and after it, equals the maximum value. If such a value is found, it returns the sum of the results of `func_2` applied to the subarrays before and after the value. If no such value is found, it takes no specific action.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function transforms a given list of integers into a "staircase" structure by modifying the list in-place and appending tuples to a result list. It takes four parameters: a non-negative integer `i`, a list of integers `arr`, a non-negative integer `start_index` within the bounds of `arr`, and a list of tuples `res`. The function checks if the sub-list of `arr` starting at `start_index` with length `i+1` is already a staircase (i.e., each element is equal to its index). If it is, the function returns without modifying the list or result. If `i` is 0, the function appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to `res` and sets the element at `start_index` in `arr` to 1. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with `i-1` and, if the current element at `start_index + i` is not equal to `i`, appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to `res` and sets all elements in the range `[start_index, start_index + i]` in `arr` to `i`. The function does not return any value explicitly, but modifies the input list and result list in-place.
