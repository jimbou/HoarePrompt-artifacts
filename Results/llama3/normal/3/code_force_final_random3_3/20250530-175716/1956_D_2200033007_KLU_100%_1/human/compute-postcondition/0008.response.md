The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer such that 1 <= `j` <= `i`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is an integer such that 2 <= `j` <= `i` + 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is a non-negative integer + 1.
State: **`i` is a non-negative integer + 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is an integer such that 2 <= `j` <= `i` + 1. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, the state of `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged.**
