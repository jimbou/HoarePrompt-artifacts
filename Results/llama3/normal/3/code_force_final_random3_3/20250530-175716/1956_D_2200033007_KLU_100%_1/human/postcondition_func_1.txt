This function takes a list of integers `arr` and two indices `start_index` and `end_index` as input, where `0 <= start_index <= end_index < len(arr)`. It calculates the maximum value of a subarray within the given range using the `func_1` function and checks if the length of the subarray is 1. If the length is 1 and the value at `start_index` is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list. If the maximum value is equal to the square of the length, it constructs a "stair" using the `make_stairs` function and returns a list containing a tuple of `start_index` and `end_index`. Otherwise, it iterates through the subarray to find a value that, when combined with the maximum values of the subarrays before and after it, equals the maximum value. If such a value is found, it returns the sum of the results of `func_2` applied to the subarrays before and after the value. If no such value is found, it takes no specific action.
