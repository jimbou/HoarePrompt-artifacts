This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by performing certain operations on a subarray of a given list of non-negative integers. It takes three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `arr`, and two non-negative integers `start_index` and `end_index` such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(`arr`). The function returns the maximum value between the square of the difference between `end_index` and `start_index` plus 1, the sum of the results of recursive calls to the function for subarrays, and the sum of the value at the start or end index and the result of a recursive call for the remaining subarray. If the result for the given `start_index` and `end_index` is already calculated, it returns the stored value.
