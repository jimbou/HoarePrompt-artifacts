Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is an integer such that 1 <= `j` <= `i`**

In this output state, the value of `is_already_stairs` has been updated to False, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous conditions still hold.
