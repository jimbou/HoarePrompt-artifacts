Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer + 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `j` is an integer such that 2 <= `j` <= `i` + 1, `is_already_stairs` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `is_already_stairs` has been updated to False, regardless of its previous state. The other variables remain unchanged, with `i` still being a non-negative integer + 1, `arr` being a list of integers, `start_index` being a non-negative integer within the specified range, `res` being a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `j` being an integer within the specified range.
