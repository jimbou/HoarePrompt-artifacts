Output State: **i is 0, arr is a list of integers with the element at start_index changed to 1, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended, is_already_stairs is False, and j is an integer such that 1 <= j <= 1**

In this final state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The list `arr` has been modified such that the element at the index `start_index` is now 1. The value of `start_index` itself remains the same, still within the valid range of indices for `arr`. The list `res` has been updated by appending a new tuple containing the value of `start_index` twice. The boolean variable `is_already_stairs` remains False, and the value of `j` is still within the range of 1 to 1, inclusive.
