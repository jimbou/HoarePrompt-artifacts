To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= `j` <= `i`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, otherwise `is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is an integer such that 1 <= `j` <= `i`**
