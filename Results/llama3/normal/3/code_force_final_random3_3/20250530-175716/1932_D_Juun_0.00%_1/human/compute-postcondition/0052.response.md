The code prints a formatted string containing two sets of characters. The first set consists of the last value popped from the `trumps` list and the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, which is `trump`. The second set also consists of the last value popped from the `trumps` list and `trump`.

Since `trumps` must contain at least 1 element, the `pop()` operation will remove and return the last element from the list. However, the exact value of the popped element is not specified in the precondition.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing two sets of characters, each set consisting of the popped value from `trumps` and `trump`.

Output: **[the popped value from trumps][trump] [the popped value from trumps][trump]**
