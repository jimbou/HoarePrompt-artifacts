Output State: **`rank` is the first character of the second word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in stdin, `card` is the second word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key `suit` is `rank`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the second word in stdin and `answers` is an empty list. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is an empty list and `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list. stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.**

In this output state, the values of `rank` and `suit` have been updated to be the first and second characters of the second word in stdin, respectively. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.
