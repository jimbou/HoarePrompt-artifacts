Precondition: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and 2n two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile. Each card is described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the card (one of "23456789"), and the second one is the suit of the card (one of "CDHS"). All cards are different.**
