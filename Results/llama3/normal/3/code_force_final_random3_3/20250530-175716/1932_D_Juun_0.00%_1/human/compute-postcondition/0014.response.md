Output State: **`rank` is the first character of the second word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in stdin, `card` is the second word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key `suit` is `rank`, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the second word in stdin, `answers` is an empty list if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list. stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `rank`, `suit`, `card`, `trump`, and `suits` remain the same as in the initial state. The list `trumps` now contains the first character of the second word in stdin, which is `rank`. The list `answers` is either empty if `suit` is equal to `trump`, or contains a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, both followed by `suit`, if `suits[suit]` is not None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list. The stdin still contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.
