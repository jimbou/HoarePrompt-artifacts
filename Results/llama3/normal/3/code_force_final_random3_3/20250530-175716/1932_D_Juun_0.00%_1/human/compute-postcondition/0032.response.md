Output State: **`trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of each word in stdin that has a suit equal to trump, with one less element than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list, and an additional string that is the concatenation of rank, suit, the popped value from trumps, and trump, `stdin` is empty, `suit` is the first key in the dictionary. If rank is None, then the current value of rank is None. Otherwise, the value of rank is not None.**

In natural language, the output state is that the `trumps` list has one less element than before, and the `answers` list has an additional string that combines the current rank, suit, the popped value from `trumps`, and the trump suit. The other variables remain unchanged.
