Postcondition: ***`trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of each word in stdin that has a suit equal to trump, with one less element than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list, and an additional string that is the concatenation of rank, suit, the popped value from trumps, and trump, `stdin` is empty, `suit` is the second key in the dictionary, `rank` is the value corresponding to the second key in the dictionary. If `rank` is None, we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
