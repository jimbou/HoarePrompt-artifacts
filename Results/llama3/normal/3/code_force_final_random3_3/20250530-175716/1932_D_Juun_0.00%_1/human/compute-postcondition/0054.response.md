Output State: **trump is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, trumps is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 4 key-value pairs, answers is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list, and 4 additional strings that are the concatenation of rank, suit, the popped value from trumps, and trump, stdin is empty, suit is the last key in the dictionary, and rank is the value corresponding to the last key in the dictionary, and this is printed: '[the popped value from trumps][trump] [the popped value from trumps][trump]'**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the list `trumps` is now empty, and the printed output is a sequence of pairs of the popped value from `trumps` and `trump`, separated by spaces.
