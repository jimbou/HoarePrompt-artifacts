Output State: **`rank` is the first character of the first word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in stdin and is equal to `trump`, `card` is the first word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in stdin, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first word.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `rank` is still the first character of the first word in stdin. The value of `suit` is still the second character of the first word in stdin and is equal to `trump`. The value of `card` is still the first word in stdin. The value of `trump` is still the character representing the trump suit of the first test case. The list `trumps` now contains the first character of the first word in stdin. The list `answers` is still empty. The dictionary `suits` still has keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None. The stdin still contains at least 1 word excluding the first word.
