Postcondition: ***`rank` is the first character of the second word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in stdin, `card` is the second word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key `suit` is `rank` if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise the value of the key `suit` is None if `suits[suit]` is not None, otherwise the value of the key `suit` is `rank`. `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the second word in stdin if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, both followed by `suit`, if `suits[suit]` is not None, otherwise `answers` is an empty list. stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.***
