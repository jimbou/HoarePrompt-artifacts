Postcondition: ***`rank` is the first character of the first word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in stdin, `card` is the first word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key `suit` is `rank`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in stdin and `answers` is an empty list. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is an empty list and `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list. stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first word.***
