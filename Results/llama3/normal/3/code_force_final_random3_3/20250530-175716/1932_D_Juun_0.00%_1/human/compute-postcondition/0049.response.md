The code prints a formatted string containing the last two elements popped from the `trumps` list, each followed by the `trump` character, and separated by a space.

Since `trumps` must contain at least 2 elements, the `pop()` operation will remove and return the last element from the list. The `trump` character is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case.

Output: **[the last element of trumps][trump] [the second last element of trumps][trump]**
