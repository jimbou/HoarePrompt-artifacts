Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: trump is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, trumps is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 4 key-value pairs, answers is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list, and 4 additional strings that are the concatenation of rank, suit, the popped value from trumps, and trump, stdin is empty, suit is the last key in the dictionary, and rank is the value corresponding to the last key in the dictionary, and this is printed: '[the popped value from trumps][trump] [the popped value from trumps][trump]'
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 4 key-value pairs, `answers` is a list that must have at least 1 string, `answer` is the first string in the list, `stdin` is empty, `suit` is the last key in the dictionary, and `rank` is the value corresponding to the last key in the dictionary, and this is printed: '[the first string in the list answers]'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 4 key-value pairs, `answers` is a list that must have at least 2 strings, `answer` is the second string in the list, `stdin` is empty, `suit` is the last key in the dictionary, and `rank` is the value corresponding to the last key in the dictionary, and this is printed: '[the second string in the list answers]'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 4 key-value pairs, `answers` is a list that must have at least 3 strings, `answer` is the third string in the list, `stdin` is empty, `suit` is the last key in the dictionary, and `rank` is the value corresponding to the last key in the dictionary, and the third string in the list `answers` which is `answer` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
