Output State: **`rank` is the first character of the first word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in stdin, `card` is the first word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None, stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first word.**

In this output state, the values of `rank` and `suit` are determined by the first word in stdin, which is assigned to `card`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains at least one word, excluding the first word that was assigned to `card`.
