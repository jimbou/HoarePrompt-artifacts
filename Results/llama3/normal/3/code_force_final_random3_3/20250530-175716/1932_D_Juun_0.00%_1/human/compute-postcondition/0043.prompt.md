Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: trump is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, trumps is a list containing the first character of each word in stdin that has a suit equal to trump, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key suit is None for all suits, answers is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list. stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of each word in stdin that has a suit equal to trump, with one less element than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list, and an additional string that is the concatenation of rank, suit, the popped value from trumps, and trump, `stdin` is empty, `suit` is the first key in the dictionary. If rank is None, then the current value of rank is None. Otherwise, the value of rank is not None.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of each word in stdin that has a suit equal to trump, with one less element than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list, and an additional string that is the concatenation of rank, suit, the popped value from trumps, and trump, `stdin` is empty, `suit` is the second key in the dictionary, `rank` is the value corresponding to the second key in the dictionary. If `rank` is None, we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of each word in stdin that has a suit equal to trump, with one less element than before, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' that must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list, and an additional string that is the concatenation of rank, suit, the popped value from trumps, and trump, `stdin` is empty, `suit` is the third key in the dictionary, and `rank` is the value corresponding to the third key in the dictionary. If `rank` is None, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `trump`, `trumps`, `suits`, `answers`, `stdin`, `suit`, and `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
