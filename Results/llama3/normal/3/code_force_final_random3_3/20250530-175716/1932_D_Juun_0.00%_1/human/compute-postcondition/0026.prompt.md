Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and 2n two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile. Each card is described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the card (one of "23456789"), and the second one is the suit of the card (one of "CDHS"). All cards are different. trump is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`rank` is the first character of the first word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in stdin, `card` is the first word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key `suit` is `rank`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in stdin and `answers` is an empty list. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is an empty list and `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list. stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first word.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`rank` is the first character of the second word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in stdin, `card` is the second word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key `suit` is `rank` if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise the value of the key `suit` is None if `suits[suit]` is not None, otherwise the value of the key `suit` is `rank`. `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the second word in stdin if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `answers` is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, both followed by `suit`, if `suits[suit]` is not None, otherwise `answers` is an empty list. stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *rank is the first character of the third word in stdin, suit is the second character of the third word in stdin, card is the third word in stdin, trump is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key suit is rank if suit is equal to trump, otherwise the value of the key suit is None if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise the value of the key suit is rank. trumps is a list containing the first character of the third word in stdin if suit is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the first character of the third word in stdin and rank. answers is an empty list if suit is equal to trump, otherwise answers is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list. stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first three words.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
