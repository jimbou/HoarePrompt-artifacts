Output State: **`rank` is the first character of the second word in stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in stdin, `card` is the second word in stdin, `trump` is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key `suit` is `rank`, `trumps` is either a list containing the first character of the second word in stdin or an empty list, `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of `rank` and `rank`, both followed by `suit`, stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `rank`, `suit`, `card`, and `trump` remain the same. The dictionary `suits` is updated such that the value of the key `suit` is now `rank`. The lists `trumps` and `answers` are either updated or remain the same based on whether `suit` is equal to `trump`. The stdin still contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.
