Output State: **rank is the first character of the second word in stdin, suit is the second character of the second word in stdin, card is the second word in stdin, trump is the character representing the trump suit of the first test case, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of the key suit is None, trumps is an empty list if suit is not equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the first character of the second word in stdin, answers is a list containing a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, both followed by suit, if suits[suit] is not None, otherwise answers is an empty list, stdin contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.**

In this output state, the values of `rank`, `suit`, `card`, and `trump` remain unchanged. The value of `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. The value of `answers` is updated to include a single string that is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, both followed by `suit`, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the second word in stdin, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list. Stdin still contains at least 1 word excluding the first two words.
