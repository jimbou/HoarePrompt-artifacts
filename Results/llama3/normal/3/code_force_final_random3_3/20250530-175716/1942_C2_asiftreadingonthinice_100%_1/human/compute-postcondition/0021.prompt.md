Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 1. If the difference between the current element of a at index i and the previous element of a at index i-1 is exactly 2, then ans is x + y - 1. If the difference is not equal to 2, then ans is x + y - 2. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is even, tmp is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the element at index 1 and the element at index 0 in list a. Otherwise, tmp remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list that contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 3. If the difference between the 3rd and 2nd elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the 3rd and 2nd elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing an additional element `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
