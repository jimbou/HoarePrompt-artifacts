Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is 2. `tmp` is a list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2. The difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is not equal to 2.***
