To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The list `a` has at least 3 elements and is sorted. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 4 elements because the loop iterates over the indices of `a` starting from 1 and going up to but not including the length of `a`. Therefore, `a` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `ans`, and `tmp`) are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3**
