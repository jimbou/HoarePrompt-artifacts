Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list that contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.***
