The code snippet consists of two lines that modify the values of `ans`, `y`, and `i`. The first line adds the value of `i` to `ans`, and the second line subtracts the value of `i - 1` from `y`.

Since `i` is the third element in `tmp`, a sorted non-empty list containing at least 3 integers, we can infer that `i` is an integer. The value of `i` is not explicitly given, but we can represent it as the third element of `tmp`.

The initial state of `ans` is not provided, so we will represent it as `ans` is an integer. The initial state of `y` is also not provided, so we will represent it as `y` is an integer.

After executing the code, the value of `ans` becomes `ans` plus the third element of `tmp`, and the value of `y` becomes `y` minus the third element of `tmp` plus 1.

The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `tmp` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same.

Output State: **tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, tmp is a sorted non-empty list containing at least 3 integers, i is the third element in tmp, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the third element of tmp, y is an integer equal to its original value minus the third element of tmp plus 1**
