Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is 2, plus 1 if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` equals 2. `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is 2, plus 1 if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` equals 2. `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, and `tmp` must not be empty, `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is updated to its original value minus `i` plus 1 and `ans` is increased by `i`. Otherwise, `y` is less than `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is updated to its original value minus `i` plus 1. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `i - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In both cases, `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, and `tmp` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, and `tmp` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
