Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value of half of this difference. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
