Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of half of the even differences between consecutive elements in `a`, including the half of the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n`, if the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n` is even, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is increased by the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of half of the even differences between consecutive elements in `a`, including the half of the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n`, if the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n` is even, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is increased by the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, `tmp` is not empty. If `y` is less than or equal to 0, `i` is the first element in `tmp`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least two elements, `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is increased by the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `i` if the condition in the else part is met, otherwise `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is increased by the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
