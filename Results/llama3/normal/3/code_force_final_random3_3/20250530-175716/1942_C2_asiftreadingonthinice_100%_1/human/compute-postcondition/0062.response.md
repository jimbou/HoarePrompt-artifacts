Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 1 if the difference is not 2 but even, or `x` + `y` - 2 if the difference is not even. `tmp` is a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` if the difference is even, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list.**
