Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
    tmp.sort()
    for i in tmp:
        if y >= i - 1:
            ans += i
            y -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least one integer, `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1 plus `y`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1 minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is 2, plus 1 if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` equals 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1, plus `y`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, `y` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1 minus the number of such elements, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n-2` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of half of the even differences between consecutive elements in `a`, including the half of the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n`, if the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n` is even, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is increased by the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` minus the length of `tmp` plus 1, `i` is equal to the last element in `tmp`, `y` is 0, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
