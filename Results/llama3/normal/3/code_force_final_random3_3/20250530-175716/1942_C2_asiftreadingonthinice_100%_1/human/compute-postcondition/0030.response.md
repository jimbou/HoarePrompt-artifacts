To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `tmp`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tmp`. If `tmp` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute.

State: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least one integer**
