Output State: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `tmp` is a list that contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to include the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`, divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
