Output State: **`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, and `tmp` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
