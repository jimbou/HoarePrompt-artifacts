To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
```
The initial state is:
`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 3

Now, let's think step by step:

* The code accesses the elements of the list `a` at indices `i` and `i-1`, where `i` is 3. Since `a` is a sorted list with at least 4 elements, we know that `a[3]` and `a[2]` exist.
* The expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1])` calculates the difference between the elements at indices `i` and `i-1`. Since `a` is sorted, we know that `a[3] >= a[2]`, so the difference is non-negative.
* The expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` calculates the integer division of the difference by 2. This will result in an integer value.
* The `tmp` list is appended with the result of the expression.

Now, let's update the output state:

* `tt` is still greater than 0.
* `ii` is still 0.
* `n` is still an integer.
* `x` is still an integer.
* `y` is still an integer.
* `a` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements.
* `stdin` still contains a space-separated list of integers.
* `i` is still 3.
* `tmp` is a list that now contains an additional element, which is the result of the expression `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.

Output State: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing an additional element `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**
