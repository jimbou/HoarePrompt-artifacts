The first line increments `ans` by the value of `i`, which is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. The second line decrements `y` by the value of `i` minus 1. Since `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, the value of `y` will be reduced to at least 0.

Output State: **tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is at least 0, a is a sorted list of integers, i is equal to the length of a - 1, tmp is a sorted non-empty list containing at least one integer, ans is increased by the value of i**
