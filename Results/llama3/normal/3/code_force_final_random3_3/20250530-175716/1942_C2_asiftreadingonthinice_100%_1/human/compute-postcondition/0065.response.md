Output State: **`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list with one element which is half of the difference between the fourth and third elements of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to include a new element, which is calculated as half of the difference between the fourth and third elements of the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
