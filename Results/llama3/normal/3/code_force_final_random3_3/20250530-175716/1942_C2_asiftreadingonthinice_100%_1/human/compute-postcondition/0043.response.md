Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least 3 integers, `i` is the third element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the third element of `tmp`, and `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the third element of `tmp` plus 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
