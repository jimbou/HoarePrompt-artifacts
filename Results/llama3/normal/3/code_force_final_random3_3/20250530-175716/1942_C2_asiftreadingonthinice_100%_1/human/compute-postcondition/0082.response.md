Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is 2, plus 1 if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` equals 2. `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, and `tmp` must not be empty, `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is updated to its original value minus `i` plus 1 and `ans` is increased by `i`. Otherwise, `y` is less than `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
