Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 1 and `tmp` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is even but not equal to 2, then `tmp` is a list containing a single element which is half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list.***
