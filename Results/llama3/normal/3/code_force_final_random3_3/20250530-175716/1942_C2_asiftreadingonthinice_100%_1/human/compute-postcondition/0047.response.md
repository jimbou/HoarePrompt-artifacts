Output: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least one integer, `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1 plus `y`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1 minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed**
