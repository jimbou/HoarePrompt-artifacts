Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 2, `i` is 1, and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is not equal to 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing a single element which is half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list.***
