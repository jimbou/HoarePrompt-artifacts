Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 3. If the difference between the 3rd and 2nd elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the 3rd and 2nd elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing an additional element `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.***
