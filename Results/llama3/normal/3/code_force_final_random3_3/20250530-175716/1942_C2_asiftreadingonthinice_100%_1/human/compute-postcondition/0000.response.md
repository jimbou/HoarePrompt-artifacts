Output State: **`tt` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `tt` is an integer that was read from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before because one test case was read to assign the value to `tt`. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
