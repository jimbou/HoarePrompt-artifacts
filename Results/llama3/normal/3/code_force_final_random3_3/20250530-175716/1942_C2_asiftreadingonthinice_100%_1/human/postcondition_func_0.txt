This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function sorts the integers, calculates the number of pairs of consecutive integers with a difference of 2, and calculates the sum of half of the even differences between consecutive integers, including the half of the difference between the first integer, n, and the last integer, if the difference is even. The function then prints the minimum value between the calculated sum and n-2 for each test case.
