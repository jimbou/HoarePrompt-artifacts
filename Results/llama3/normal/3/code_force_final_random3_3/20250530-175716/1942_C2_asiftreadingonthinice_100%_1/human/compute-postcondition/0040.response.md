The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `tmp`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tmp`. If `tmp` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `tmp` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `tmp`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `tmp` must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in `tmp`.
State: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least 3 integers, `i` is the third element in `tmp`.**
