Output State: **tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, i is equal to the length of a minus 1, tmp is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in a that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of a plus n and the last element of a is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, and tmp must have at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list tmp, ans is increased by i, y is decreased by i - 1**
