Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ans` is an integer. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the value ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2) in addition to its previous values. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.**
