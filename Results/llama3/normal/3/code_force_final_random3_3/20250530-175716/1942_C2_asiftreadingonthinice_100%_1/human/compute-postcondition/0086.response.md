Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is updated to its original value minus `i` plus 1. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `i - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In both cases, `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, and `tmp` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`.**
