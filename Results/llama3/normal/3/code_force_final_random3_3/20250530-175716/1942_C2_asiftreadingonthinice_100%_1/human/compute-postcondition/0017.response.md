Output State: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 3, `ans` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `tt` is still greater than 0, the value of `ii` is still 0, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are still integers, the list `a` is still sorted and has at least 4 elements, the stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers, the value of `i` is still 3, and the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1.
