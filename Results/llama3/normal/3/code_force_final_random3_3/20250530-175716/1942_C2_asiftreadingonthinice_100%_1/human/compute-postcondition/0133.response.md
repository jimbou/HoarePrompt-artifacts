Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least two elements, `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is increased by the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
