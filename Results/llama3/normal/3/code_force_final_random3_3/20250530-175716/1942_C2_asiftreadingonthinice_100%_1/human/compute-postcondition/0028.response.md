Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` equals 2, then `ans` is greater than `x + y - 1`. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even but not 2, then `tmp` is a list containing at least one integer which is half of the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n`, and stdin is empty. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is 2, then `ans` is greater than `x + y - 2`. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is even but not 2, then `tmp` is a non-empty list containing one or more integers which are half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp` and stdin remains unchanged.**
