Output State: **`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of half of the even differences between consecutive elements in `a`, including the half of the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n`, if the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n` is even, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is 2, and `ans` is increased by the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` minus the length of `tmp` plus 1, `i` is equal to the last element in `tmp`, `y` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `ans` which is increased by the value of `y`, and `y` which is now 0.
