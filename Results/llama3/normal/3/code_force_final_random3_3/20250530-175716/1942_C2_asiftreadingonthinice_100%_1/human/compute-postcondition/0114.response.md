Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2) in addition to its previous values. Otherwise, `ans` and `tmp` remain unchanged.***
