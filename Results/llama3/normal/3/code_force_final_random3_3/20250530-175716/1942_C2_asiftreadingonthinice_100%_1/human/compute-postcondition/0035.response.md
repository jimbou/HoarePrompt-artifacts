Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least one integer. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `i - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
