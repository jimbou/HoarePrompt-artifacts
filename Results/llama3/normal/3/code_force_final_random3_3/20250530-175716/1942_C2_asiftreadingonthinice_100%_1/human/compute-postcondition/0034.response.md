Output State: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least one integer, and `y` is less than `i - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program execution will continue from the point after the loop or if statement that was broken out of.
