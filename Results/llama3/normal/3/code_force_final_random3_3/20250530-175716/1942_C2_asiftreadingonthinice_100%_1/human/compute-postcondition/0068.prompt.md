Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, i is not defined, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 2, `i` is 1. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 1. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is not equal to 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 1 if the difference is not 2 but even, or `x` + `y` - 2 if the difference is not even. `tmp` is a list containing one element which is half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` if the difference is even, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list with one element which is half of this difference. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
