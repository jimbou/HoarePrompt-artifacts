Postcondition: **tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is equal to the length of a - 1. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in a whose difference is 2, then ans is greater than x + y - 2. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in a whose difference is even but not 2, then tmp is a non-empty list containing one or more integers which are half of the differences between adjacent elements in a. Otherwise, tmp remains an empty list. The difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is not equal to 2. The current value of the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is even.**
