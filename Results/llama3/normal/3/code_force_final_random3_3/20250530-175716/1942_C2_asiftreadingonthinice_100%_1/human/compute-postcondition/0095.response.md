State: **`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is 2, plus 1 if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` equals 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1, plus `y`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, `y` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` plus 1 minus the number of such elements, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n-2` is printed**
