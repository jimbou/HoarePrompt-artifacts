Output State: **`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `ans` is increased by 1, If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by the number of such pairs. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer values of half of these differences. The current value of the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted, and the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a` is still 2. The number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2 is still counted in `ans`. The list `tmp` still contains the integer values of half of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not 2.
