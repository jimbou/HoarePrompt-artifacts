To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in tmp:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `tmp`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `tmp` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference. Additionally, `tmp` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`.

For the loop to execute again, `tmp` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list `tmp`.

State: **`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, and if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even but not equal to 2, it also contains half of this difference, and `tmp` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`.**
