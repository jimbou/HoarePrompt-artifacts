Postcondition: ***tt is greater than 2, ii is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, i is equal to the length of a - 1. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in a is 2, ans is increased by the number of such pairs. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in a is even but not 2, tmp is a list containing the integer values of half of these differences. The difference between the first element of a and the last element of a plus n is not equal to 2***
