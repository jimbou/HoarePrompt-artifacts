Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` equals 2, then `ans` is greater than `x + y - 1`. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even but not 2, then `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one integer which is half of the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n`. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is 2, then `ans` is greater than `x + y - 2`. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `a` whose difference is even but not 2, then `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing one or more integers which are half of the differences between adjacent elements in `a`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp` and stdin remains empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least one integer. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `i - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least 2 integers, `i` is the second element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of the second element in `tmp`, and `y` is decreased by the value of the second element in `tmp` minus 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least 3 integers, `i` is the third element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the third element of `tmp`, and `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the third element of `tmp` plus 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
