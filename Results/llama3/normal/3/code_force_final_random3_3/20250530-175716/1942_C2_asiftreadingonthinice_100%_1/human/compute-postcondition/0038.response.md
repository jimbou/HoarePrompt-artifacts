Output State: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is the second element in the `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted non-empty list containing at least 2 integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
