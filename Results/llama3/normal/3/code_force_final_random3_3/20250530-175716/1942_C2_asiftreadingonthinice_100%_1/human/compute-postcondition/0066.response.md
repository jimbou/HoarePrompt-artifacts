Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list with one element which is half of this difference. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
