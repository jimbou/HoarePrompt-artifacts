Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is greater than 2, ii is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, i is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 1 and `tmp` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is even but not equal to 2, then `tmp` is a list containing a single element which is half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value of half of this difference. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is odd, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2) in addition to its previous values. Otherwise, `ans` and `tmp` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
