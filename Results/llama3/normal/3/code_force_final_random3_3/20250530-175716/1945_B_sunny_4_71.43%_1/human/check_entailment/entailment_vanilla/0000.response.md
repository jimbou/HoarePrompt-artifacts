Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), adding 1 to each result, and then summing these two values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Read the number of test cases (t) and iterate over each test case.
2. For each test case, read the frequencies of launching for the first and second installations (a and b) and the time the firework is visible in the sky (m).
3. Calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation by dividing m by a and adding 1. This is because the first installation launches fireworks every a minutes, so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the integer part of m/a plus 1 (to account for the firework that is visible for m+1 minutes).
4. Similarly, calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the second installation by dividing m by b and adding 1.
5. Sum the maximum number of fireworks from both installations to get the overall maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
