The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^18), b is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^18), m is an integer (1 <= m <= 10^18), A is an integer equal to int(m / a) + 1, B is an integer equal to int(m / b) + 1, and the sum of A and B is printed**
