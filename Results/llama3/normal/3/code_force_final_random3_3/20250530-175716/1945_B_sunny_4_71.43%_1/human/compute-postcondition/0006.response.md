Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^18), b is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^18), m is an integer (1 <= m <= 10^18), A is an integer equal to int(m / a) + 1, B is an integer equal to int(m / b) + 1, and the sum of A and B is printed.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers a, b, and m. It then calculates the values of A and B based on these integers and prints their sum. The value of t remains unchanged, and stdin now contains t-3 lines. The values of a, b, and m are updated to the newly read values, and A and B are calculated based on these new values. The sum of A and B is printed, but this does not affect the state of any variables.
