State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^18), b is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^18), m is an integer (1 <= m <= 10^18), A is an integer equal to int(m / a) + 1, B is an integer equal to int(m / b) + 1, and the sum of A and B is printed which is equal to (int(m / a) + 1) + (int(m / b) + 1)**
