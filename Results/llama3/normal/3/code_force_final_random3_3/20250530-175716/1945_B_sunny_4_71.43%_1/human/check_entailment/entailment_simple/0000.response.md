Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Here's why:

* The program calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation (A) and the second installation (B) separately.
* For each installation, it calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for that installation (a or b), and adding 1. This is because the first firework is launched at time 0, and the last firework that can be seen is launched at time m.
* The program then adds the number of fireworks that can be seen from both installations (A + B) to get the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
