The code prints the sum of two values, A and B. A is the integer value of m divided by a, plus 1. B is the integer value of m divided by b, plus 1. Where m is an integer (1 <= m <= 10^18), a is an integer (1 <= a <= 10^18), and b is an integer (1 <= b <= 10^18).
Output: **A + B (where A is int(m/a) + 1 and B is int(m/b) + 1)**
