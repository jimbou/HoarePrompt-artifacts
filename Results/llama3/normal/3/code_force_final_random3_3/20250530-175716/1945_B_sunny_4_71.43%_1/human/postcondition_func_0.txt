This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers a, b, and m. For each case, it calculates the sum of the smallest integers A and B such that A is greater than or equal to m/a and B is greater than or equal to m/b, and prints this sum. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
