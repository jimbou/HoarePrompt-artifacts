Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. It does this by calculating the number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation (A and B) and adding them together.

The calculation for A and B is correct because it takes into account the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) and the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b). The expression `int(m / a) + 1` calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation, and similarly for the second installation.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the frequency of launching is the same for both installations, or where the time the firework is visible in the sky is very large.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
