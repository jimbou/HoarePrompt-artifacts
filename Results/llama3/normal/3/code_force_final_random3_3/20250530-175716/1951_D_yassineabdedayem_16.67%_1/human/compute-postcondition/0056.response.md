Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, k is the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the minimum of n // k and k, and k - Min > 0 or n > k, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to `Max`, which is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The value of `k` has also been updated to `k - Min`, which is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` minus the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
