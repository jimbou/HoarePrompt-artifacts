Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged. The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated to be the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively. The stdin remains empty.
