Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases that have been read. The current value of `Max` equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`***
