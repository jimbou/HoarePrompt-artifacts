Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, k is either k - Max or the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k - Max > 0 or n > k. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k, otherwise number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k***
