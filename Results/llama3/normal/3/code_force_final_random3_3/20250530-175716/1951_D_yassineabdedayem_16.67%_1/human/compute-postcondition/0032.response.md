To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in tab:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of the list `tab`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `tab`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `tab` has at least 1 string element, `i` is the first string element in `tab`, and the first string element in `tab` which is `i` is being printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least 2 string elements, and `i` must be the second string element in `tab`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 string elements, `number` is the last value assigned to it, `Min` and `Max` are the last values assigned to them, 'YES' is being printed, the length of `tab` which is the number of string elements in `tab` is being printed, and `i` is the second string element in `tab`**
