Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value but not 0 and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n` but not 0, `rep` is greater than its original value but less than 60, `tab` contains two more string elements than its original value, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the current values of `n` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `number` is still dependent on the values of `Max` and `n * Min`, but the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated.
