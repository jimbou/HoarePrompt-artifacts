Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases that have been read.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged. The new variables `Min` and `Max` are introduced, where `Min` is the minimum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k` itself, and `Max` is the maximum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k` itself. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases that have been read.
