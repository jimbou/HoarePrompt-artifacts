Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 and must remain greater than or equal to `k` after adjustments, `k` is greater than 0 and must be reduced appropriately to maintain `k > 0` and `n >= k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, `Min` is the minimum of `(n - Min * Max) // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int((n - Min * Max) / k)` and `k`, and adjustments to `number` and `k` are made based on the given conditions, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated based on the given conditions. `Min` is now the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is now the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
