Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to k and n / k is less than k, rep is 2, tab is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of n // k and k and another string representation of the minimum of n // k and k. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of n // k and k, number is the minimum of n // k and k, and k is k - Max and k - Max > 0. Otherwise, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of n // k and k, number is the maximum of n // k and k, and k is k - Min and k - Min > 0.***
