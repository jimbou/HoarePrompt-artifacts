The code prints the second string representation of a number in the list `tab` followed by a space.
Since `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of a number, and `i` is the second string representation of a number in the list, the print statement will output the value of `i` followed by a space.
Output: **the second string representation of a number in the list tab (which is i) followed by a space**
