Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated to be the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, and `int(n / k)` and `k`, respectively.
