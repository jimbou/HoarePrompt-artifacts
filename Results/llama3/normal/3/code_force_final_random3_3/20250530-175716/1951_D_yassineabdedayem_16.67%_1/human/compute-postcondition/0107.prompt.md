Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty. If Max equals k and the product of n and Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k. Otherwise, either Max is not equal to k or n * Min is greater than k, and number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is less than its original value by Min.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. If Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, and k is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k subtracted from its original value. Otherwise, k is equal to k - Min, and number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 0 and is reduced by Min * Max, k is greater than 0 and is reduced appropriately to maintain k > 0 and n >= k, rep is 3, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, the string representation of number, and the string representation of number.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
