Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, k is a positive integer less than or equal to its original value, rep is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, tab contains multiple string elements, number is the last value assigned to it, Min and Max are the last values assigned to them.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of t remains unchanged, the value of n becomes 0, the value of k is less than or equal to its original value, the value of rep is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, the list tab contains multiple string elements, and the values of number, Min, and Max are the last values assigned to them during the loop execution.
