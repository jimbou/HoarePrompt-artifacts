Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 0 and is reduced by Min * Max, k is greater than 0 and is reduced appropriately to maintain k > 0 and n >= k, rep is 3, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, the string representation of number, and the string representation of number.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, but it is ensured that `n` remains greater than or equal to `k` after this adjustment. The value of `k` is also reduced appropriately to maintain the conditions `k > 0` and `n >= k`. The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The list `tab` now contains three string representations of `number`, which is calculated based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
