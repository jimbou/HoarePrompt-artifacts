Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, Min and Max are the last values assigned to them, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of four lines that assign new values to the variables `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab`. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This line also empties stdin. The second line assigns 0 to `rep`. The third line assigns 0 to `number`. The fourth line assigns an empty list to `tab`. The variable `t` is not affected by the code and remains a positive integer greater than 1. The variables `Min` and `Max` are also not affected and remain the last values assigned to them.
