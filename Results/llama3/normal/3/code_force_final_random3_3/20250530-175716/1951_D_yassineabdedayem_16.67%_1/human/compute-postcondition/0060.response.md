Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` and `n / k` is less than `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of `n // k` and `k` and another string representation of the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`, `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `k` is `k - Max` and `k - Max > 0**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` remain unchanged. The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated to the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively. The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`, which is greater than 0.
