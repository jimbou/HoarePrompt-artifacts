Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of n and k are updated to the integers read from stdin. The value of rep is reset to 0, and the value of number is also reset to 0. The list tab is emptied. Stdin is now empty as it has been read.
