Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 0 and must remain greater than or equal to k after adjustments, k is greater than 0 and must be reduced appropriately to maintain k > 0 and n >= k, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number. If Max equals k and n times Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k, and k is the maximum of int(n / k) and k reduced by the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and k is reduced by the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k.**
