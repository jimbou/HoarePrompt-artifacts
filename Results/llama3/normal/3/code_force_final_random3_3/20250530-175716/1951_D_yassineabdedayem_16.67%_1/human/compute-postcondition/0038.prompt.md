Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, k is 0, rep is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, tab contains multiple string elements, number is the last value assigned to it, Min and Max are the last values assigned to them, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of tab which is the number of string elements in tab is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string element, `number` is the last value assigned to it, `Min` and `Max` are the last values assigned to them, 'YES' is being printed, the length of `tab` which is the number of string elements in `tab` is being printed, and `i` is the first string element in `tab`, and the first string element in `tab` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 string elements, `number` is the last value assigned to it, `Min` and `Max` are the last values assigned to them, 'YES' is being printed, the length of `tab` which is the number of string elements in `tab` is being printed, `i` is the second string element in `tab`, and the second string element in `tab` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 string elements, `number` is the last value assigned to it, `Min` and `Max` are the last values assigned to them, 'YES' is being printed, the length of `tab` which is the number of string elements in `tab` is being printed, `i` is the third string element in `tab`, the third string element in `tab` which is `i` is being printed, and the third string element in `tab` which is `i` is being printed again




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
