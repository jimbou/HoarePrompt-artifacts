Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, stdin is empty. If Max is equal to k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k, and k is the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is k - Min.***
