To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `n`, `k`, and `rep` according to the conditions in the `while` loop statement.

1. `n != 0`: Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, we don't need to adjust its state.
2. `k > 0`: Since `k` is either `k - Max` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` minus the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k - Max > 0` or `n > k`, we need to ensure that `k` remains greater than 0. We can't adjust `k` directly, but we can adjust `Max` to ensure that `k - Max > 0`. Since `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, we can adjust `n` to ensure that `n / k` is less than `k`, so that `Max` is `k` and `k - Max > 0`.
3. `rep < 60`: Since `rep` is 2, we don't need to adjust its state.
4. `n >= k`: Since `n` is either `n - Min * Max` or `n - Min * Max - Min * Max`, and `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than or equal to `k`. We can adjust `n` to ensure that `n - Min * Max >= k`.

Considering the above adjustments, we can modify the state as follows:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` and `n / k` is less than `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of `n // k` and `k` and another string representation of the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is `k`, `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `k` is `k - Max` and `k - Max > 0`**
