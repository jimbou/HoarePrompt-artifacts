Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list of strings that must have at least as many string elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `number` is the last value assigned to it, `Min` and `Max` are the last values assigned to them, 'YES' is being printed, the length of `tab` which is the number of string elements in `tab` is being printed, `i` is the last string element in `tab`, and the last string element in `tab` which is `i` is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop iterates over each string element in the `tab` list, printing each element. After all iterations, `i` will hold the last string element in `tab`, and this last element will be printed. The length of `tab`, which is the number of string elements in `tab`, will also be printed.
