Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the minimum of n // k and k, k is the maximum of int(n / k) and k subtracted from its original value, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` is updated to be the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` subtracted from its original value. The value of `rep` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `tab` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `Min` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `Max` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `number` is updated to be the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is empty.
