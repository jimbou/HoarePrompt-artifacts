Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is 0, rep is a positive integer less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing string representations of the minimum of n // k and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, k is 0, stdin is empty, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is 0 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is a positive integer less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of 0, `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is at least 1 is being printed, `i` is the string representation of 0, and the string representation of 0 which is '0' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is a positive integer less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations, `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is at least 2 is being printed, `i` is the second string representation in the list `tab`, the second string representation in the list `tab` is being printed, and the second string representation in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is a positive integer less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations, `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is at least 3 is being printed, `i` is the third string representation in the list `tab`, the third string representation in the list `tab` is being printed, and the third string representation in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space, and the third string representation in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
