Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases that have been read.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The variables `rep` and `number` are initialized to 0, and `tab` is initialized as an empty list. Since one test case has already been read and assigned to `t` before this code block, and this code block reads another test case, stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases that have been read.
