Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, rep is 2, tab is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of n // k and k and another string representation of the minimum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, k is either k - Max or the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k - Max > 0 or n > k. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k, otherwise number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and n is either n - Min * Max or n - Min * Max - Min * Max.**

The code block modifies the values of `rep`, `tab`, `n`, and potentially `number` and `k`. The first line appends a string representation of `number` to the `tab` list. The second line decrements `n` by the product of `Min` and `Max`, which are the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively. The third line increments `rep` by 1. The values of `t`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged. The value of `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, depending on the conditions specified in the initial state. The value of `k` is either `k - Max` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` minus the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k - Max > 0` or `n > k`.
