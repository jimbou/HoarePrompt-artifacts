Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases that have been read.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value, k is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than its original value, rep is greater than its original value, tab contains one more string element than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value but not 0, k is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to n but not 0, rep is greater than its original value but less than 61, tab contains two more string elements than its original value, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value but not 0 and must be greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to n but not 0, rep is greater than its original value but less than 61, tab contains three more string elements than its original value, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. If Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k and k is less than its original value. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
