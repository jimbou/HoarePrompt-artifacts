Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty. If Max equals k and the product of n and Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k. Otherwise, either Max is not equal to k or n * Min is greater than k, and number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is less than its original value by Min.***
