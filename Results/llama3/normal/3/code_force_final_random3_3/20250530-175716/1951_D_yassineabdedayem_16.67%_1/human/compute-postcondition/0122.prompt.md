Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, the current value of k is 0, rep is 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of tab which is equal to 1 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, k is 0, rep is 60, tab is a list containing at least 1 string representation of a number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of tab which is equal to 1 is being printed, i is the first string representation of a number in the list, and the first string representation of a number in the list which is i is being printed followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, k is 0, rep is 60, tab is a list containing at least 2 string representations of a number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of tab which is equal to 2 is being printed, i is the second string representation of a number in the list, and the second string representation of a number in the list which is i is being printed followed by a space, and the second string representation of a number in the list which is i is being printed followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, k is 0, rep is 60, tab is a list containing at least 3 string representations of a number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of tab which is equal to 3 is being printed, i is the third string representation of a number in the list, and the third string representation of a number in the list which is i is being printed followed by a space, and the third string representation of a number in the list which is i is being printed followed by a space, and the third string representation of a number in the list which is i is being printed followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
