Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value but not 0, k is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to n but not 0, rep is greater than its original value but less than 61, tab contains two more string elements than its original value, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k.**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. The first line appends the string representation of the `number` variable to the `tab` list. Since `tab` originally contained one more string element than its original value, it now contains two more string elements than its original value.

2. The second line subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. Since `n` was originally a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value but not 0, it remains a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value but not 0.

3. The third line increments the `rep` variable by 1. Since `rep` was originally greater than its original value but less than 60, it is now greater than its original value but less than 61.

The final state of the variables is as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0.
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value but not 0.
- `k` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n` but not 0.
- `rep` is greater than its original value but less than 61.
- `tab` contains two more string elements than its original value.
- `Min` and `Max` remain the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively.
- `number` remains either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` (if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`) or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` (otherwise).
