Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, Min and Max are the last values assigned to them, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, k is either k - Min or the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, rep is 2, tab is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of n // k and k and another string representation of the minimum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, k is either k - Max or the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k - Max > 0 or n > k. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k, otherwise number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and n is either n - Min * Max or n - Min * Max - Min * Max.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to k and n / k is less than k, rep is 3, tab is a list containing three string representations of the minimum of n // k and k, number is the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of n // k and k, and k is k - Max if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise k is k - Min and k - Min > 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
