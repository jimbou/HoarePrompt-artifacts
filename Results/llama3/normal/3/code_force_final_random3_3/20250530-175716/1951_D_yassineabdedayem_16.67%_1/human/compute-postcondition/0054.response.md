Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `k` is either `k - Min` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` minus the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k - Min > 0` or `n > k`, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated to be the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, and the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
