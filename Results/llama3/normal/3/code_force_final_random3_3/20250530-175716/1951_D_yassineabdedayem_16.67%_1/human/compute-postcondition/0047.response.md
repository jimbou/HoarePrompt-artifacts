Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, stdin is empty. The current value of `Max` equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`***
