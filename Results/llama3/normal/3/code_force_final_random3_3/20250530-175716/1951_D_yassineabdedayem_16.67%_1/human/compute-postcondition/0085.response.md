State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, rep is a positive integer less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing string representations of the minimum of n // k and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty. If k is 0, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list tab which is 0 is being printed, and all string representations in the list tab are being printed followed by a space. If k is not 0, 'NO' is being printed and k is either k - Min or the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k.**
