Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to k and n / k is less than k, rep is 3, tab is a list containing three string representations of the minimum of n // k and k, number is the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of n // k and k, and k is k - Max if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise k is k - Min and k - Min > 0.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is decreased by the product of `Min` and `Max`, which are the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively. The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The list `tab` now contains three string representations of the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. The value of `number` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state, and it is either the minimum or maximum of `n // k` and `k`. The values of `Min` and `Max` are the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively. The value of `k` is updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and it is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, with the condition that `k - Min > 0`.
