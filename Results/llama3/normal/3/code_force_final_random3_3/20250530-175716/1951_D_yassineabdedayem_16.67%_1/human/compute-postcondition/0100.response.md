Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. If Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, and k is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k subtracted from its original value. Otherwise, k is equal to k - Min, and number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k.**
