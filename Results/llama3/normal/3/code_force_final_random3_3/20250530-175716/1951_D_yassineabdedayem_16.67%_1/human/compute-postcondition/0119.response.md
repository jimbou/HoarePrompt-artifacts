The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  tab, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tab.  If the list has at least 3 string representations of a number the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, tab has at least 2 string representations of a number, i is the second string representation of a number in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 string representations of a number and the i is the third string representation of a number in the list.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, k is 0, rep is 60, tab is a list containing at least 3 string representations of a number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of tab which is equal to 3 is being printed, i is the third string representation of a number in the list, and the third string representation of a number in the list which is i is being printed followed by a space, and the third string representation of a number in the list which is i is being printed followed by a space**
