The code prints the second string representation in the list `tab` followed by a space. The second string representation in the list `tab` is being printed because `i` is the second string representation in the list `tab`. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function adds a space after the string representation.
Output: **the second string representation in the list tab (followed by a space)**
