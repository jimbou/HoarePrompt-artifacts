Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than its original value but not 0 and must be greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to n but not 0, rep is greater than its original value but less than 61, tab contains three more string elements than its original value, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. If Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k and k is less than its original value. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k.**

This output state reflects the changes made by the code snippet. The value of `n` has been reduced by `Min * Max`, and `rep` has been incremented by 1. The list `tab` now contains one more string element than its original value, which is the string representation of `number`. The values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated based on the new value of `n`. The value of `number` is determined based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and `k` may have been reduced if `Max` equals `k` and `(n - Min * Max) * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.
