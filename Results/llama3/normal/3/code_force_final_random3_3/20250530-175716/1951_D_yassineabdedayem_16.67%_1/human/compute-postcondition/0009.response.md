Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer less than or equal to n. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is Min. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is updated to k - Min.***
