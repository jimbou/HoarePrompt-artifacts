The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list  tab, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tab.  If the list has at least 3 string elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, tab has at least 2 string elements, i is the second string element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 string elements and the i is the third string element in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 string elements, `number` is the last value assigned to it, `Min` and `Max` are the last values assigned to them, 'YES' is being printed, the length of `tab` which is the number of string elements in `tab` is being printed, `i` is the third string element in `tab`, and the third string element in `tab` which is `i` is being printed**
