To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `tab`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list has at least 1 string element, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string element, `number` is the last value assigned to it, `Min` and `Max` are the last values assigned to them, 'YES' is being printed, the length of `tab` which is the number of string elements in `tab` is being printed, and `i` is the first string element in `tab`**
