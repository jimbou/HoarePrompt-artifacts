Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced two new variables, `Min` and `Max`, which are calculated based on the values of `n` and `k`. `Min` is the minimum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k` itself, while `Max` is the maximum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k` itself. The `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
