Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and k. It attempts to find a sequence of numbers that can be used to make k jewels with n coins, following certain rules. If a valid sequence is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. If no valid sequence is found, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
