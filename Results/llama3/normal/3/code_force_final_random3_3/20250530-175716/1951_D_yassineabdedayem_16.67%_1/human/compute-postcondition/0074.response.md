The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  tab, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tab.  If the list has at least 2 string representations the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, tab has at least 1 string representation of 0, i is the string representation of 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 string representations and the i is the second string representation in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is a positive integer less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations, `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` which is at least 2 is being printed, `i` is the second string representation in the list `tab`, and the second string representation in the list `tab` is being printed**
