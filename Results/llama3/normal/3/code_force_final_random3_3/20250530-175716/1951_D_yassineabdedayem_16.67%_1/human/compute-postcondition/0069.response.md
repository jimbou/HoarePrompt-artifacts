Based on the precondition, the variable `tab` is a list containing string representations of the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. Since `n` is 0 and `k` is 0, the minimum of `n // k` and `k` is 0. Therefore, the list `tab` contains a single element, which is the string representation of 0, i.e., '0'.

The `print` statement is printing the length of the list `tab`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
