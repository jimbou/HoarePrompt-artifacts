Based on the precondition, the code will print the first string representation of a number in the list `tab`, followed by a space.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `i` is the first string representation of a number in the list `tab`.
* The `print` statement is executed with `i` as its argument.
* Since `i` is a string representation of a number, it will be printed as is.
* The `end=' '` argument specifies that a space should be printed after the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output will be the first string representation of a number in the list `tab`, followed by a space.

Output: **[first string representation of a number in the list tab] **
