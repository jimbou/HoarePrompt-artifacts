Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of the minimum of n // k and k, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the minimum of n // k and k, k is either k - Max or the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k - Max > 0 or n > k.**

The code first assigns the value of Min to number, making number equal to the minimum of n // k and k. Then, it assigns the value of k - Max to k, making k equal to either k - Max or the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k. The values of t, n, rep, tab, Min, and Max remain unchanged.
