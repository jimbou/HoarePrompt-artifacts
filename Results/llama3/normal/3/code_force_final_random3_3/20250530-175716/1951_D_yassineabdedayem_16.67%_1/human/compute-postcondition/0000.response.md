The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two positive integers `n` and `k`. The first input is accepted and converted to an integer, and assigned to `t`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, each with two positive integers `n` and `k`, minus one test case that has been read and assigned to `t`. 
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been read and assigned to `t`, each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `k`.**
