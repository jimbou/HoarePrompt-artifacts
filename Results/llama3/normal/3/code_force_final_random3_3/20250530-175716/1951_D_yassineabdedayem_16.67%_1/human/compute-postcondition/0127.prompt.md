Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been read and assigned to `t`, each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `k`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, rep is greater than its original value but less than or equal to 60, tab contains multiple string elements, number is the last value assigned to it, Min and Max are the last values assigned to them. If k is 0, 'YES' is printed, the length of tab is printed, and the last string element in tab is printed. If k is greater than 0, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is 0, rep is a positive integer less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing string representations of the minimum of n // k and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty. If k is 0, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list tab which is 0 is being printed, and all string representations in the list tab are being printed followed by a space. If k is not 0, 'NO' is being printed and k is either k - Min or the maximum of int(n / k) and k minus the maximum of int(n / k) and k.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is 0, rep is 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, stdin is empty. If k is 0, 'YES' is being printed, and the 60th string representation of a number in the list is being printed 60 times followed by a space. If k is not equal to 0, 'NO' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
