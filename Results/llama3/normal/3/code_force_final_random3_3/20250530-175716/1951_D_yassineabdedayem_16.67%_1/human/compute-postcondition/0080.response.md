Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is 0, rep is a positive integer less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing string representations of the minimum of n // k and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, k is 0, stdin is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list tab which is 0 is being printed, and all string representations in the list tab are being printed followed by a space.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all string representations in the list `tab` are being printed followed by a space, while the other variables remain unchanged.
