Based on the initial state, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, but its value is not used in the code snippet.
* `n` is 0, which means `int(n / k)` will also be 0, since `k` is also 0.
* `rep` is 60, but its value is not used in the code snippet.
* `tab` is a list containing the string representation of a number. Since `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and both `n` and `k` are 0, `number` will also be 0. Therefore, `tab` contains the string representation of 0, which is "0".
* `stdin` is empty, which means there is no input to be read.
* `'YES'` is being printed, but this is not related to the code snippet.

Now, let's analyze the code snippet:

* `print(len(tab))`: This statement prints the length of the `tab` list.

Since `tab` contains only one element, which is the string representation of 0, the length of `tab` is 1.

Output: **1**
