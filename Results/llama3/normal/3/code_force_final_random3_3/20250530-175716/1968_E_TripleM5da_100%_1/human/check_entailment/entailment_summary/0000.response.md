Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a set of n points in an n x n grid that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. The program provided attempts to solve this problem by printing a sequence of pairs of numbers, starting with (1, 1) and (1, 2), followed by pairs of identical numbers from 3 to n.

However, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The sequence of pairs printed by the program does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, when n = 3, the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), but the optimal solution is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
