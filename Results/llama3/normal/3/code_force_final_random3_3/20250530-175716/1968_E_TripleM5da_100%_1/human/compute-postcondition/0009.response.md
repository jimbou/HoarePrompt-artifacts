To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables and their conditions for the loop to execute again.

The loop head variables are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i in range(3, n + 1)`, which means `i` must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` has printed 1, 2, and 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains at least 0 integer, and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, and 4 is being printed**
