Output State: **`i` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least 0 integers, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + 1`) being printed `n - 1` times**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input from `stdin`, and the value of `i` is still equal to `n + 1`. The output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + 1`) being printed `n - 1` times. The number of integers in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
