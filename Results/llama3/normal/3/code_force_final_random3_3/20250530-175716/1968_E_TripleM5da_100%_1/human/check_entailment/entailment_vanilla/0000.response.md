Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the value of n. It then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, the program has a logical error. It always prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) regardless of the value of n. This is incorrect because the optimal arrangement of cells depends on the value of n.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the optimal arrangement for n = 3 is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), as shown in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
