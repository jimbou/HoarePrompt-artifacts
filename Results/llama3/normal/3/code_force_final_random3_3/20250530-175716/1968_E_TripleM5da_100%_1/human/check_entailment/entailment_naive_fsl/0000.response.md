Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. For example, when n = 3, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

As shown in the example in the problem description, this arrangement maximizes the size of H.

The program's logic is incorrect because it simply prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (i, i) for i from 3 to n. This does not guarantee that the Manhattan distances between any pair of cells will be maximized.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as the one shown in the example outputs in the problem description.
