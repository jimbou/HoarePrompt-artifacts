Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains at least 0 integer, and this is printed: 1, 2, and all integers from 3 to `n` are being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed twice.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, which is an integer. The input state remains unchanged, with stdin containing at least 0 integers. The output will include the initial print of 1 and 2, followed by the print of all integers from 3 to `n` (inclusive), with each integer being printed twice.
