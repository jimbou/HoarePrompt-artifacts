To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

The other states, such as `stdin` and the output, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `stdin` contains at least 0 integers, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + 1`) being printed `n - 1` times, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and this is printed: 3, 3**
