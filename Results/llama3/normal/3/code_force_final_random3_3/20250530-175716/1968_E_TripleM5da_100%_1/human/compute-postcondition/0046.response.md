To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 5**

Note that the other variables, such as `stdin`, `output`, `input_value`, are not modified in the loop head, so their states remain the same.
