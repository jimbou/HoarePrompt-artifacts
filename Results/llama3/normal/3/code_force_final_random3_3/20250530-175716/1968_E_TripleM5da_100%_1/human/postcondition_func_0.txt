This function reads a positive integer `t` and then `t` integers `n` from standard input, where `n` is between 2 and 10^3. It then prints a sequence of pairs of numbers, starting with (1, 1) and (1, 2), followed by pairs of identical numbers from 3 to `n`. The function does not return any value, but its output includes the initial pairs and the sequence of identical pairs up to `n`. The input state of `stdin` remains unchanged, and the output is printed to the console.
