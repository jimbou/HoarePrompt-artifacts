Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, `stdin` contains at least 0 integers, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + 1`) being printed `n - 1` times, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n` (inclusive) are printed twice each.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one more than the value of `n`, and the output will include the initial values 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n`, and then the values from 3 to `n` (inclusive) printed twice each, with the value of `i` (now equal to `n + 1`) printed `n - 1` times.
