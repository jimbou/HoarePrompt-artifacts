Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, `stdin` contains at least 0 integers, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + 1`) being printed `n - 1` times, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and this is printed: 3, 3, and this is printed: 4, 4, and this is printed: 5, 5, and so on, until `i` is `n + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n + 1`, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + 1`) being printed `n - 1` times. The loop has executed `n - 2` times, and the output includes the printed values of 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, and so on, until `i` is `n + 1`. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `stdin`, remains unchanged.
