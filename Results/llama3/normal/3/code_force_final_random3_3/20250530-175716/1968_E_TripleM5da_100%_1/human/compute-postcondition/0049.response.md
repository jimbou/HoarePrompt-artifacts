Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 and is now equal to the integer input from stdin, `stdin` contains at least -1 integers, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + 1`) being printed `n - 1` times, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and this is printed: 3, 3, and this is printed: 4, 4, and this is printed: 5, 5, and so on, until `i` is `n + 1`, and `input_value` is at least 5, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the current value of `i` which is `n + 1` and the current value of `i` which is `n + 1` is being printed, and this is printed: `n + 1`, `n + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the value of `i` has reached `n + 1`, and the output includes all the printed values from the initial state, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + 1`) being printed `n - 1` times. The loop has completed its execution, and the final output includes the last printed values of `n + 1`, `n + 1`.
