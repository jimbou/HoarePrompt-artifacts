Output State: `i` is `n + t - 1`, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 and is now equal to the integer input from stdin, `stdin` contains at least `t - 1` integers, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + t - 1`) being printed `n - 1` times, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and this is printed: 3, 3, and this is printed: 4, 4, and this is printed: 5, 5, and so on, until `i` is `n + t - 1`, and `input_value` is at least `t`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the current value of `i` which is `n + t - 1` and the current value of `i` which is `n + t - 1` is being printed, and this is printed: `n + t - 1`, `n + t - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n + t - 1`, and the value of `n` will remain unchanged. The input state of stdin will also remain unchanged. The output will include the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + t - 1`) being printed `n - 1` times.
