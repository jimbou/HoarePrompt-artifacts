Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints n points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program first prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2), which are the base cases for the problem. Then, it enters a loop that runs from 3 to n (inclusive), printing the points (i, i) in each iteration.

The key insight here is that the Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. By printing the points (i, i), the program is effectively creating a diagonal line in the grid, where the Manhattan distance between any two points on this line is equal to the difference between their x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).

Since the program prints n points, and each point has a unique Manhattan distance from every other point, the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
