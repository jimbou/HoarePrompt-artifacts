According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains at least 0 integer, and this is printed: 1, 2. So for the loop to be executed  the `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 and `i` is now 3.
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains at least 0 integer, and this is printed: 1, 2**
