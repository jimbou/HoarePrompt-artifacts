Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains at least 0 integer, and this is printed: 1, 2, and `n` is being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n` is being printed `n - 2` times.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the value of `n` will remain unchanged. The input state of stdin will also remain unchanged. The output will include the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n`) being printed `n - 2` times.
