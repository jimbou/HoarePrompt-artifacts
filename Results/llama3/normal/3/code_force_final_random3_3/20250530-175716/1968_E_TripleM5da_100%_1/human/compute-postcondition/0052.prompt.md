You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (t) and then t integers (n). t is a positive integer and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n + t - 1`, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 and is now equal to the integer input from stdin, `stdin` contains at least `t - 1` integers, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + t - 1`) being printed `n - 1` times, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and this is printed: 3, 3, and this is printed: 4, 4, and this is printed: 5, 5, and so on, until `i` is `n + t - 1`, and `input_value` is at least `t + 2`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the current value of `i` which is `n + t - 1` and the current value of `i` which is `n + t - 1` is being printed, and this is printed: `n + t - 1`, `n + t - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n + t - 1`, and the value of `n` will remain unchanged. The input state of stdin will also remain unchanged. The output will include the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + t - 1`) being printed `n - 1` times.

```

Return Postconditions: Output State: `i` is `n + t - 1`, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 and is now equal to the integer input from stdin, `stdin` contains at least `t - 1` integers, and the output includes the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + t - 1`) being printed `n - 1` times, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and this is printed: 3, 3, and this is printed: 4, 4, and this is printed: 5, 5, and so on, until `i` is `n + t - 1`, and `input_value` is at least `t + 2`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the current value of `i` which is `n + t - 1` and the current value of `i` which is `n + t - 1` is being printed, and this is printed: `n + t - 1`, `n + t - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n + t - 1`, and the value of `n` will remain unchanged. The input state of stdin will also remain unchanged. The output will include the initial printed values of 1 and 2, followed by the value of `n` being printed, and the value of `i` (which is now equal to `n + t - 1`) being printed `n - 1` times.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
