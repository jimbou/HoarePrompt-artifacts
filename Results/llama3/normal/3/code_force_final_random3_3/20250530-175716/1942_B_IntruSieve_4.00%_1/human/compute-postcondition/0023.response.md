Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `maxx + 1` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `maxx + 1` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `mex` contains 0, `minn` is `maxx + 1`, and `maxx` is updated to 1 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `maxx + 1` is greater than `maxx`.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to `maxx + 1`, and the value of `mex` is recalculated based on the new value of `minn`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `maxx` is updated based on the first element of `arr` and the new value of `minn`.
