Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 2, arr is a list of n integers, mex contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of arr and minn if the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn is greater than maxx, otherwise mex contains 0, minn is updated to maxx + 1 if minn equals maxx, and maxx is updated to 1 if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise maxx is updated to the absolute value of the first element of arr if the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn is greater than maxx.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 1, and `i` remains 2. The list `arr` still contains `n` integers. The value of `mex` is updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, `mex` contains 0. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`. Otherwise, `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`. The value of `minn` is incremented by 1. The value of `maxx` is updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, `maxx` is updated to 1. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.
