Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.***
