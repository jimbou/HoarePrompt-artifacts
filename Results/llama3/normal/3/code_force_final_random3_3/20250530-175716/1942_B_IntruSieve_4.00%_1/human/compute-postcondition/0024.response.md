Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, i is 2, arr is a list of n integers. If minn equals maxx, mex contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of arr and maxx + 1 if the absolute difference between the first element of arr and maxx + 1 is greater than maxx, otherwise mex contains 0, minn is maxx + 1, and maxx is updated to 1 if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise maxx is updated to the absolute value of the first element of arr if the absolute difference between the first element of arr and maxx + 1 is greater than maxx. If minn is not equal to maxx, mex contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of arr and minn if the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn is greater than maxx, otherwise mex contains 0, minn is updated to maxx + 1 if minn equals maxx, and maxx is updated to 1 if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise maxx is updated to the absolute value of the first element of arr if the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn is greater than maxx.***
