Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`, `maxx` is updated to 1 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, and `minn` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` is updated to be one more than the value of `maxx`. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mex` remain unchanged. The value of `maxx` is also updated based on the first element of `arr`, but its exact value depends on the specific value of the first element of `arr`.
