Output State: **`mex` is an empty list, `itm` is not defined, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`, and no elements are being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `mex` is empty, indicating that all elements in `arr` have been processed. The variable `itm` is no longer defined, as it was only used within the loop to iterate over the elements of `mex`. The variables `minn` and `maxx` have been updated according to the loop's logic, but no printing is occurring since the loop has finished executing.
