Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` and `minn`, and `mex` contains either 0 and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, no updates are made to `maxx` and `mex`.***
