The code appends the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` to the `mex` list. Since the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, and `minn` is 0, the absolute difference is equal to the absolute value of the first element of `arr`. Therefore, the `mex` list now contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of n integers, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, and the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0**
