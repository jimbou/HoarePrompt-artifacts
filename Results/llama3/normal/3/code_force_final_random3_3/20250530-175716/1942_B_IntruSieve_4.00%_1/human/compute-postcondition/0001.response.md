To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, we are given that `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, but this information is not directly relevant to the loop execution. The loop execution depends on the value of `n`, which is an integer, and the list `arr` which has `n` integers.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to 0 (since the loop starts from 0). The other variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` are not directly related to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of n integers, `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0**
