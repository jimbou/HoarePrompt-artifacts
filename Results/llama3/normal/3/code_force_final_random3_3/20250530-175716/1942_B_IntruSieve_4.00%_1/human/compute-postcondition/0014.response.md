Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, arr is a list of n integers, mex contains the absolute value of the first element of arr if the first element of arr is less than or equal to 0, otherwise mex contains 0, minn is updated to maxx + 1 if minn equals maxx, maxx is updated to 1 if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise maxx is updated to the absolute value of the first element of arr if the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn is greater than maxx, and minn is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 1, and `i` remains 1. The list `arr` still contains `n` integers. The value of `mex` is updated based on the first element of `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mex` contains 0. The value of `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`. The value of `maxx` is updated to 1 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`. Finally, `minn` is incremented by 1.
