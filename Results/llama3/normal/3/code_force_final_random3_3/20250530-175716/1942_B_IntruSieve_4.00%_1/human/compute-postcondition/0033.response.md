According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex` list. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `mex` has at least 1 element, `itm` is the first element in the `mex` list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `itm` is the second element in the `mex` list.
State: **`mex` is a list of absolute values of differences between each element of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 2 elements, `itm` is the second element in the `mex` list, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`**
