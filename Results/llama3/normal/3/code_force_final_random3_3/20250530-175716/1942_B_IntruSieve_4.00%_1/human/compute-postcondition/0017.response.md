Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn`, if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to include the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn`. The values of `minn` and `maxx` have been updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
