Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`. If the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn`, and `maxx` is the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mex` and `maxx`.***
