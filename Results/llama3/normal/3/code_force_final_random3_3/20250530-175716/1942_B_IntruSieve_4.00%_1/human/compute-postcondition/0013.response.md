The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**
