Output State: **mex contains the absolute values of the differences between each element of arr and minn, minn is updated to maxx + 1 if minn equals maxx, and maxx is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of arr and minn.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `mex` contains the absolute values of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`, where `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`. This means that `mex` will contain the absolute values of the differences between each element of `arr` and the minimum value that is greater than or equal to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`.
