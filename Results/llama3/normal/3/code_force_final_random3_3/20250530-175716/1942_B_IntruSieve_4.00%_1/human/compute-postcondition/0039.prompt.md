Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: mex contains the absolute values of the differences between each element of arr and minn, minn is updated to maxx + 1 if minn equals maxx, and maxx is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of arr and minn.
Code of the loop:
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mex` is a list of absolute values of differences between each element of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 1 element, `itm` is the first element in the `mex` list, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`, and the first element of the `mex` list which is `itm` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mex` is a list of absolute values of differences between each element of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 2 elements, `itm` is the second element in the `mex` list, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`, and the second element of the `mex` list which is `itm` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mex` is a list of absolute values of differences between each element of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 3 elements, `itm` is the third element in the `mex` list, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`, and the third element of the `mex` list which is `itm` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
