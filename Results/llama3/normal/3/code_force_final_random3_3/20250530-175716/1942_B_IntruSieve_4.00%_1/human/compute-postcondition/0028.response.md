Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx` and the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `maxx` + 1 is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If `minn` is not equal to `maxx`, `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, then if the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` and `minn`, and `mex` contains either 0 and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, no updates are made to `maxx` and `mex`.**
