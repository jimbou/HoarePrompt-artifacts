Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is equal to `maxx + 1` and `maxx` is 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be equal to `maxx + 1`, which is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `mex` still contains only 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is still greater than 0. The value of `maxx` is still 1.
