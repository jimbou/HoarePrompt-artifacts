Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn`, `maxx` is the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`.**

In this output state, the value of `maxx` has been updated to the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `maxx` is now dependent on the values of `arr` and `minn`.
