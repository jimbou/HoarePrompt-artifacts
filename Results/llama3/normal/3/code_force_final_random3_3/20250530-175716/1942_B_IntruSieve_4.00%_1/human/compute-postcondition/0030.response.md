To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itm` and `mex`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex` list. If `mex` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `mex` contains the absolute values of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`.

So, for the loop to be executed, `mex` must have at least 1 element, and `itm` is the first element in the `mex` list.

State: **`mex` is a list of absolute values of differences between each element of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 1 element, `itm` is the first element in the `mex` list, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum absolute value of the differences between each element of `arr` and `minn`**
