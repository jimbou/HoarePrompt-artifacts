Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation p based on an array a. The program iterates through the array a and calculates the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation p (mex) at each step. It then uses this mex value to construct the permutation p.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the different cases of the array a correctly. When arr[i] is greater than 0, it appends the current mex value to the permutation p and increments the mex value. When arr[i] is less than or equal to 0, it appends the absolute difference between the current mex value and arr[i] to the permutation p.

The program also handles the case where the mex value equals the maximum value in the permutation p (maxx) by updating the mex value to maxx + 1.

The program's output is also correct, as it prints the constructed permutation p for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
