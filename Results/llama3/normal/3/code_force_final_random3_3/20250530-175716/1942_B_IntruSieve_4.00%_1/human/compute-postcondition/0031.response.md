The code prints the first element in the `mex` list, which is the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`. The value of `itm` is the first element in the `mex` list, which is the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`. The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that the output will be followed by a space.

Output: **the first element in the mex list (which is the absolute value of the difference between the first element of arr and minn)**
