Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p based on the given array a. The program iterates through the array a and calculates the MEX (minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array) at each step. If the current element of a is positive, it means that the MEX is the current minimum value, so it appends the minimum value to the mex list and increments the minimum value. If the current element of a is negative, it means that the MEX is the absolute difference between the current element and the minimum value, so it appends this value to the mex list and updates the maximum value if necessary. Finally, it prints the calculated mex list, which represents a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a.

Correctness: **True**
