Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list of n integers, mex is a list containing 0, minn is 1, maxx is 0. The current value of arr[i] is greater than 0**

The code starts by appending the value of `minn` to the `mex` list. Since `minn` is initially 0, the `mex` list now contains the value 0. The second line increments the value of `minn` by 1, making it 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
