Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `minn` is 0, and the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0. If the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr`.***
