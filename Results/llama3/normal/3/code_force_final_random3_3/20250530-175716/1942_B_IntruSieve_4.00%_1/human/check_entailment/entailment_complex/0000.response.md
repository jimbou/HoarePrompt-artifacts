Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by maintaining a running minimum value (`minn`) and maximum value (`maxx`) as it iterates through the input array `arr`. The program calculates the absolute difference between each element of `arr` and `minn`, and updates `minn` and `maxx` accordingly.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program does not correctly calculate the MEX (minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array) of the prefix of the permutation. The MEX is not simply the minimum value that has not appeared yet, but rather the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the prefix.

2. The program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the input array `arr`. The permutation `p` should be constructed such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, but the program does not enforce this condition.

3. The program does not handle the case where `arr[i]` is negative correctly. When `arr[i]` is negative, the program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, but this is not the correct way to handle negative values.

4. The program does not print the permutation `p` correctly. The program prints the calculated differences, but these differences do not necessarily form a valid permutation.

Overall, the program is not correct because it does not correctly calculate the MEX, construct the permutation `p`, handle negative values, or print the permutation `p`.

Correctness: **False**
