Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `maxx` is the absolute difference between the third element of `arr` and `minn`, `mex` is either 0 and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `maxx` has been updated to the absolute difference between the third element of `arr` and `minn`, while the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mex` remain unchanged. The value of `mex` is still dependent on the first element of `arr`, and its value is either 0 and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0.
