Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, and the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than or equal to `maxx`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `maxx` is updated to be the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, which is also the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`. All other variables remain unchanged.
