Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n). n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`. If the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn`, and `maxx` is the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mex` and `maxx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, then `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx` and the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `maxx` + 1 is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If `minn` is not equal to `maxx`, `mex` contains the absolute value of the difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` if the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `mex` contains 0, `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1 if `minn` equals `maxx`, and `maxx` is updated to 1. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, then if the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` and `minn`, and `mex` contains either 0 and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` if the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, no updates are made to `maxx` and `mex`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
