Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, i is 1, arr is a list of n integers, mex contains the absolute value of the first element of arr if the first element of arr is less than or equal to 0, otherwise mex contains 0, if minn equals maxx, then minn is updated to maxx + 1, otherwise minn is incremented by 1, and maxx is updated to 1 if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise maxx is updated to the absolute value of the first element of arr if the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn is greater than maxx.***
