Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n). n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0.**

Explanation:
The first line reads an integer t from stdin, which is the number of test cases. The second line reads a list of n integers from stdin, where n is the number of integers in the current test case. The third line initializes an empty list mex. The fourth line initializes minn to 0. The fifth line initializes maxx to 0. 

Since the code only reads the first test case, there are t-1 test cases left in stdin. The value of n is the number of integers in the current test case, and arr is the list of integers read from stdin. The list mex is empty, and minn and maxx are initialized to 0.
