Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the current value of `l` at index `l[i] - 1` is equal to `l[i] - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `x` is still a positive integer, and `l` is still a list of integers. A new variable `flag` has been introduced and is set to True. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The relationship between the elements of list `l` at index `l[i] - 1` and `l[i]` remains the same, i.e., the value at index `l[i] - 1` is equal to `l[i] - 1`.
