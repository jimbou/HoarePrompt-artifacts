Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `x` + 1, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
