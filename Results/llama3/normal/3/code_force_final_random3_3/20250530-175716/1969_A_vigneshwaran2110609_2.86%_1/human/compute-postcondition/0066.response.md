Output State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is `x`, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `flag` is either True or False. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1` at any point during the loop, then `flag` is True and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, and the list `l` and the input from stdin remain unchanged. The value of `flag` will be True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met at any point during the loop, and False otherwise. Additionally, if the condition was met, the number 2 will have been printed, otherwise the number 3 will be printed.
