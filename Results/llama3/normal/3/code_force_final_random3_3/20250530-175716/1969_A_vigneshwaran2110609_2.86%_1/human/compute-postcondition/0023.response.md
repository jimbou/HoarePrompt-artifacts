To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `x`, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `x + 1`. Since `i` is now `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than `x + 1`, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
