Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of friends and their best friends, and checks if any friend's best friend is the same as their own index (1-based). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed for at least 2 friends to come to the party. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the range of the number of test cases, the number of friends, and the distinctness of the best friends. It also correctly handles the case where no pair of friends has the same best friend.

Correctness: **True**
