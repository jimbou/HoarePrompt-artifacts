The code sets the value of `flag` to `True`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 1, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `flag` is True**
