Output: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the current value of `l` at index `l[i] - 1` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken., and the number 2 is printed**
