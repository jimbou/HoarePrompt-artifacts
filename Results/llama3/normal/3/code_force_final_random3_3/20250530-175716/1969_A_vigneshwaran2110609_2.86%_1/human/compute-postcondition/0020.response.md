Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, as specified by the `break` statement.
