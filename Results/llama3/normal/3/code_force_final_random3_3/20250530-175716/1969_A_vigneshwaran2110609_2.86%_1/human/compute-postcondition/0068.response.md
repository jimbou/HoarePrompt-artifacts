Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes test cases, and prints results. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and n distinct integers. The function checks if any integer in the list matches its 1-based index and prints 2 if a match is found, otherwise prints 3. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.**
