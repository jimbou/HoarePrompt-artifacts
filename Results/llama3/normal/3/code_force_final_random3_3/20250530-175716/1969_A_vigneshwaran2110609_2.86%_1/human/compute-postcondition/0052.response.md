Output State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, flag is True, the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, the number 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `x`, `i`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is still equal to `l[i] - 1`. The number 2 is still being printed. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
