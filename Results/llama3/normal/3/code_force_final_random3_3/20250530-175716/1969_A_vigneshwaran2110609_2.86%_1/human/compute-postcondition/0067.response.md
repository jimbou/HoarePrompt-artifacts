Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, x is greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to x, l is a list of integers, stdin contains no test cases, flag is either True or False. If l[l[i] - 1] equals l[i] - 1 at any point during the loop, then flag is True and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be greater than or equal to 0, `x` will be greater than or equal to 0, and `i` will be equal to `x`. The list `l` will still contain integers, and there will be no more test cases left in the standard input. The flag variable will be either True or False, depending on whether the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met at any point during the loop. If this condition was met, the number 2 will have been printed, otherwise the number 3 will have been printed.
