Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. We are still breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number 2 is still being printed. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement again, which means we exit another level of nesting.
