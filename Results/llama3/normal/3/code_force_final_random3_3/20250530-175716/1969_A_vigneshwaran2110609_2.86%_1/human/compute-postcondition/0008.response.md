Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the current value of `l` at index `l[i] - 1` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The condition that the current value of `l` at index `l[i] - 1` is equal to `l[i] - 1` is still valid. The number 2 is still being printed. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
