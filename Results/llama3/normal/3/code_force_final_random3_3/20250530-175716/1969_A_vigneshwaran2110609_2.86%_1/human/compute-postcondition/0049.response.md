Output State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, flag is True and the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`**

The code sets the value of `flag` to True. The other variables are not affected by this code. The value of `n` is still greater than `x` + 2, `x` is still an integer and is at least 1, `i` is still 0, `l` is still a list of integers, stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is still equal to `l[i] - 1`.
