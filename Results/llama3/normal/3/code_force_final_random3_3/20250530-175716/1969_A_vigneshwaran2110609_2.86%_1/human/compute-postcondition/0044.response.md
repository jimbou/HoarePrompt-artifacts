Output State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x`, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1` for any `i` in the range of `x`, then `flag` is True and the number 2 has been printed. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and the number 3 has been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, and the list `l` remains unchanged. If at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was true, then the flag is set to True and the number 2 is printed. If this condition was never true during the loop's execution, then the flag remains False and the number 3 is printed. The values of `n` and stdin remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
