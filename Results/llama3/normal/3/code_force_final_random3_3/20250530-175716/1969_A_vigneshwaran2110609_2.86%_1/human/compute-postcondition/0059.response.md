Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then the flag is set to True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
