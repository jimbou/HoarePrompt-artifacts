Output State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 1, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, `flag` is True, and the number 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `i`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The relationship between `l[l[i] - 1]` and `l[i] - 1` is still valid. The number 2 is still being printed. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
