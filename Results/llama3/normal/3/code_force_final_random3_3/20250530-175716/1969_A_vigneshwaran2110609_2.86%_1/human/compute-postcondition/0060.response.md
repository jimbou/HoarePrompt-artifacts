The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 1 and `n` is greater than `x` + 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**
