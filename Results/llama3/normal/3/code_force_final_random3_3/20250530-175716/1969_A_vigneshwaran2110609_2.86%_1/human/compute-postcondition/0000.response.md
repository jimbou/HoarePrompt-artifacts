Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains the rest of the test cases (t-1 test cases remaining) where each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `n` has been assigned an integer value between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and the standard input (stdin) now contains the remaining test cases, which are `t-1` in number. Each of these test cases still consists of an integer `n` (between 2 and 50) followed by `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (each between 1 and `n`, and not equal to its 1-based index `i`).
