Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than x + 2, x is an integer, i is x + 1, l is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, flag is either True or False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, flag is either True or False. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then the number 2 is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then the flag is set to True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
