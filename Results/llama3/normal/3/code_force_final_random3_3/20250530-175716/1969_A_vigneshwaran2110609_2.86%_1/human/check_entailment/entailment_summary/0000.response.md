Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party.

The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The execution summary also confirms that the program processes all test cases correctly and leaves the input stream empty.

Correctness: **True**
