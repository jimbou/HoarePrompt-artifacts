Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, flag is either True or False. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then the number 2 is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
