Output State: **`n` is greater than `x` + 1, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `flag` is True, the number 2 has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `i`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The number 2 has already been printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
