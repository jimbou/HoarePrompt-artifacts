Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 1, x is an integer that must be greater than 1, l is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the current value of l at index l[i] - 1 is equal to l[i] - 1, then flag is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
