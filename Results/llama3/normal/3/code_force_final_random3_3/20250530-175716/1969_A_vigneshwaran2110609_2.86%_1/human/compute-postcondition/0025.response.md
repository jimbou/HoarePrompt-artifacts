The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If x is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is greater than x + 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than x + 1, `i` is 0,  `x` must be greater than 0, l is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
