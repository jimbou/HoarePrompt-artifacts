Output State: **n is greater than x + 1, i is x + 1, x is an integer, l is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. This means that the value of `x` is now an integer, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `l`. This means that `l` is now a list of integers, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.

The initial state of `n` is greater than `x + 1`, and the initial state of `i` is `x + 1`. Since the value of `x` has changed, the value of `i` is now `x + 1`, where `x` is the new integer value. The value of `n` is still greater than `x + 1`, since the code does not modify `n`.

In summary, the code block modifies the values of `x` and `l`, and updates the value of `i` based on the new value of `x`. The value of `n` remains greater than `x + 1`.
