Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `x` + 2, `x` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
