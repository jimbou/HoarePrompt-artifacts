Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
5
3 1 2 5 4

The program will print 2, but the correct answer is 3. The program only checks if there is a pair of friends that are each other's best friends, but it does not consider the case where there are multiple pairs of friends that are each other's best friends.

In this case, the friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, and the friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends. Therefore, the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send is 3, not 2.

The program only checks for the existence of a single pair of friends that are each other's best friends, but it does not consider the case where there are multiple pairs. Therefore, it is incorrect.
