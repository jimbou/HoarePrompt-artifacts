Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the array has an even number of elements. In this case, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but the program only considers the second middle element.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4], the median is 2.5, but the program will return 2 as the median, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should handle the case where the array has an even number of elements separately, and calculate the median as the average of the two middle elements.
