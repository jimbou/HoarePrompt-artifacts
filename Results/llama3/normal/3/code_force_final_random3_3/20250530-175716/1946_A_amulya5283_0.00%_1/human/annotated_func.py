    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is `n/2` for each test case in `test_cases`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2` times for each test case in `test_cases`, `operations` is `n/2`, `heap[0]` is greater than or equal to `current_median`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of values of 'operations' for each test case in 'test_cases', where 'operations' is n/2 for each test case, 'n' is an even positive integer equal to the first element of each test case in 'test_cases'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It calculates the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the second half of the sorted list greater than the median for each test case. The function returns a list of these operation counts, where each count is equal to `n/2` for each test case.
