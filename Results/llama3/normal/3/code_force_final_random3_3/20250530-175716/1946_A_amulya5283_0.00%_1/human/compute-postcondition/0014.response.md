Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + 1 times, operations is 1**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The smallest element is removed from the heap and its value is incremented by 1.
- The incremented smallest element is pushed back into the heap.
- The number of operations is incremented by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.
