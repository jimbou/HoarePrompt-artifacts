Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 times, operations is n/2**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the heap has been modified such that the smallest element has been incremented by n/2 times, and the number of operations is equal to n/2. The other variables remain unchanged.
