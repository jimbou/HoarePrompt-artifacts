Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + 3 times, operations is 3, heap[0] is less than current_median.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The `heapq.heappop(heap)` operation removes the smallest element from the heap, which is then stored in the `smallest` variable.
*   The `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` operation increments the smallest element by 1 and pushes it back into the heap. This operation modifies the heap by replacing the smallest element with the incremented value.
*   The `operations += 1` statement increments the `operations` variable by 1, reflecting the additional operation performed on the heap.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, along with the updated values of the variables that are modified by the code.
