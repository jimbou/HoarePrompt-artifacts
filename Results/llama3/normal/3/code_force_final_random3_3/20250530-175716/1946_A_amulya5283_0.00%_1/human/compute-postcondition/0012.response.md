Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 times, operations is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of several variables. The first line assigns the value of the first element of the first test case in `test_cases` to `n`, and the value of the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` to `arr`. The second line sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The third line calculates the median index by dividing `n` by 2. The fourth line assigns the value of the element at the median index in `arr` to `current_median`. The fifth line creates a new list `heap` containing the second half of `arr` (from the median index to the end), and the sixth line heapifies this list. The seventh line resets the value of `operations` to 0.

Note that the values of `t`, `i`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
