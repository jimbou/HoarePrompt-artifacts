To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to examine the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. The loop will execute if this condition is true.

Given the initial states:

* `heap` is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of `arr`.
* `current_median` is a positive integer equal to the middle element of `arr`.

Since `heap` contains the second half of `arr` and `arr` is sorted, the smallest element in `heap` (i.e., `heap[0]`) will be greater than or equal to the middle element of `arr` (i.e., `current_median`) if `n` is even. However, if `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` is included in the first half of `arr`, and thus not in `heap`. In this case, `heap[0]` will be greater than `current_median`.

To guarantee that the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. This can be achieved by adjusting the state of `n` to be even, so that the middle element of `arr` is included in the second half of `arr` and thus in `heap`.
