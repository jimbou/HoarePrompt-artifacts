You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers.
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is `n/2` for each test case in `test_cases`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2` times for each test case in `test_cases`, `operations` is `n/2`, `heap[0]` is greater than or equal to `current_median`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of values of 'operations' for each test case in 'test_cases', where 'operations' is n/2 for each test case, 'n' is an even positive integer equal to the first element of each test case in 'test_cases'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of values of 'operations' for each test case in 'test_cases', where 'operations' is n/2 for each test case, 'n' is an even positive integer equal to the first element of each test case in 'test_cases'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
