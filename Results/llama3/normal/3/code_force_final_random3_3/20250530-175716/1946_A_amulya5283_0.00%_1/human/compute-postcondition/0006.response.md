Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by 2, operations is 2**

The code snippet modifies the heap by popping the smallest element, incrementing it by 1, and then pushing it back into the heap. This operation is performed twice, resulting in the smallest element being incremented by 2. The number of operations is also incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
