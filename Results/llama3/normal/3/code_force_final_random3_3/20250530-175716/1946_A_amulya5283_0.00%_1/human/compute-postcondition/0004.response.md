Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer equal to the middle element of arr, heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by 1, operations is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `test_cases` list remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The `results` list remains empty as no results are added to it in the code. The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The `arr` list remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The `median_index` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The `current_median` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The `heap` list is modified as the smallest element is removed and replaced with the smallest element incremented by 1. The `operations` variable is incremented by 1 as a result of the code execution.
