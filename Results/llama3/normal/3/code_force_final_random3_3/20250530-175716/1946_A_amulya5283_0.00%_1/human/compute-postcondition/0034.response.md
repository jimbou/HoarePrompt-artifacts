Functionality: **This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It calculates the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the second half of the sorted list greater than the median for each test case. The function returns a list of these operation counts, where each count is equal to `n/2` for each test case.**
