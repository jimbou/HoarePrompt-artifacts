Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, arr = test_cases[i]
    arr.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    current_median = arr[median_index]
    heap = arr[median_index:]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    operations = 0
    while heap[0] <= current_median:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is `n/2`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2` times, `operations` is `n/2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of operations which is `n/2` and the new value of operations which is `n/2`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2 + n/2` times, `operations` is `n/2`, `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is `n/2` and the new value of `operations` which is `n/2 + n/2`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2 + n/2 + n/2` times and `heap[0]` is greater than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is `n/2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
