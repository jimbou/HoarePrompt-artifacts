Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2 and the new value of operations which is n/2, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + n/2 times, operations is 1**

The code snippet modifies the state of the program by popping the smallest element from the heap, incrementing it by 1, and pushing it back into the heap. This operation increments the value of the smallest element in the heap by 1 and increments the operations counter by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
