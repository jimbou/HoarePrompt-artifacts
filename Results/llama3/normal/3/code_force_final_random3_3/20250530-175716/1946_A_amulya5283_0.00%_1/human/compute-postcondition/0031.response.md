Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is `n/2` and the new value of `operations` which is `n/2 + n/2`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2 + n/2 + n/2` times and `heap[0]` is greater than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is `n/2`.**

The code appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list. Since `operations` is `n/2`, the `results` list now contains the value of `n/2` and the new value of `operations` which is `n/2 + n/2`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
