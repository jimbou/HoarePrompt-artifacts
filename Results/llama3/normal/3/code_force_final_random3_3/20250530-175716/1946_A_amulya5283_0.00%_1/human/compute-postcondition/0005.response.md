To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `heap` and `current_median`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is the smallest element of the second half of `arr` incremented by 1, and `current_median` is the middle element of `arr`.

To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `heap[0]` is still less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` has already been incremented by 1, we need to adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`.

State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by 1, operations is 1**
