Output State: t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2 and the new value of operations which is n/2 + n/2, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + n/2 + n/2 times and heap[0] is greater than or equal to current_median, operations is n/2.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The loop continues to execute until heap[0] is greater than or equal to current_median. After the loop finishes executing, the smallest element in the heap has been incremented by n/2 + n/2 + n/2 times, and the value of operations is n/2. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
