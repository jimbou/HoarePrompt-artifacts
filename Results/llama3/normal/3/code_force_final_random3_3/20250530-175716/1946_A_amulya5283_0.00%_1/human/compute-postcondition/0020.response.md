Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of operations which is `n/2` and the new value of operations which is `n/2`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2 + n/2` times, `operations` is `n/2`, `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains the value of operations which is `n/2` and the new value of operations which is `n/2`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
