The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is `n/2`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2` times, `operations` is `n/2`.**
