Output State: t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2 and the new value of operations which is n/2, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + n/2 + n/2 times, operations is n/2.

The loop will execute until heap[0] is greater than current_median. After each iteration, the smallest element in the heap is incremented by 1. Since the smallest element is initially incremented by n/2 + n/2 times, it will be incremented by n/2 + n/2 + n/2 times after the loop finishes. The number of iterations is equal to the number of times the smallest element needs to be incremented to be greater than current_median, which is n/2. Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
