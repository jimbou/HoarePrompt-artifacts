Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2 and the new value of operations which is n/2 + 1, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + n/2 + 2 times and heap[0] is less than current_median, operations is 3**

The code executes two operations on the heap. The first line removes the smallest element from the heap, and the second line adds the smallest element plus one back to the heap. This increments the smallest element in the heap by one. The third line increments the operations counter by one. 

The value of `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`. The `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, and `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`. 

The heap is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2 + n/2 + 2` times, and `heap[0]` is less than `current_median`. The `operations` counter is incremented by one, making it equal to 3.
