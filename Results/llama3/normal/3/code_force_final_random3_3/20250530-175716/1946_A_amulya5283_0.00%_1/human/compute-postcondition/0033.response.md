Output State: **The program returns a list of values of 'operations' for each test case in 'test_cases', where 'operations' is n/2 for each test case, 'n' is an even positive integer equal to the first element of each test case in 'test_cases'.**

In this output state, the returned list contains the value of 'operations' for each test case in 'test_cases'. The value of 'operations' is calculated as n/2 for each test case, where 'n' is an even positive integer equal to the first element of each test case in 'test_cases'.
