Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array by sorting the array, identifying the median index, and using a heap to increment the smallest elements in the second half of the sorted array until they are greater than the median.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. The use of a heap to efficiently increment the smallest elements in the second half of the sorted array is a good optimization.

The execution summary also confirms that the program produces the correct output for each test case, which further supports the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
