To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is less than `current_median`, but we need to ensure that this condition still holds for the next iteration.

Since `heap[0]` is less than `current_median`, we can keep `heap[0]` as is. However, we need to adjust `current_median` to ensure that it is still greater than or equal to `heap[0]`. We can do this by keeping `current_median` as a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of operations which is `n/2` and the new value of operations which is `n/2 + 1`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2 + n/2 + 1` times and `heap[0]` is less than `current_median`, `operations` is 2**
