Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by 3, operations is 3**

The code executes two operations on the heap. The first line removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The second line increments the `smallest` element by 1 and pushes it back into the heap. As a result, the smallest element in the heap is now incremented by 1. The `operations` variable is incremented by 1, reflecting the additional operation performed on the heap.
