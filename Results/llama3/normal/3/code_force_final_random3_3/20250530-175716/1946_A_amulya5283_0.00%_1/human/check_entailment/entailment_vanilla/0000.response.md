Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases `t` and the arrays for each test case.
2.  It then defines a function `func_1` that takes `t` and `test_cases` as input and returns a list of results.
3.  Inside `func_1`, the program iterates over each test case, sorts the array, and finds the median index and current median value.
4.  It then creates a heap from the elements in the array that are greater than or equal to the median index. This heap is used to keep track of the smallest elements that need to be increased to raise the median.
5.  The program enters a loop where it continuously pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap. This process is repeated until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
6.  The number of operations performed in the loop is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
7.  Finally, the program appends the result to the `results` list and returns it.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array.

Correctness: **True**
