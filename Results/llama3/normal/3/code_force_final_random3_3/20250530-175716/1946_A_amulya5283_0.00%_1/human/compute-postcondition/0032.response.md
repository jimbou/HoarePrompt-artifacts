Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is `n/2` for each test case in `test_cases`, `n` is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, `heap` is a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2` times for each test case in `test_cases`, `operations` is `n/2`, `heap[0]` is greater than or equal to `current_median`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

*   The value of `t` remains the same as the initial state.
*   The value of `i` will be one less than the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times.
*   The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
*   The `results` list will contain the value of `operations` for each test case in `test_cases`, which is `n/2` for each test case.
*   The value of `n` will be the first element of the last test case in `test_cases`.
*   The `arr` list will be a sorted list of `n` positive integers equal to the second element of the last test case in `test_cases`.
*   The value of `median_index` will be `n // 2`.
*   The value of `current_median` will be a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`.
*   The `heap` list will be a heapified list of `n/2` positive integers equal to the second half of `arr` except for the smallest element which has been incremented by `n/2` times for each test case in `test_cases`.
*   The value of `operations` will be `n/2`.
*   The value of `heap[0]` will be greater than or equal to `current_median`.
