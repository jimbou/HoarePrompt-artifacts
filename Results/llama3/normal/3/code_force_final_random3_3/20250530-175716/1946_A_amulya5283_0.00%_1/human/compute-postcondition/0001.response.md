According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list**
