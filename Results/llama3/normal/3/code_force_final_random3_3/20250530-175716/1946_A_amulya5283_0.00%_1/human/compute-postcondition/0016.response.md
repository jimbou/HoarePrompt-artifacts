Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + 2 times, operations is 2, heap[0] must be less than or equal to current_median**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This reduces the size of the heap by 1.
- The second line increments the value of `smallest` by 1 and pushes it back into the heap. This increases the size of the heap back to its original size, but with the smallest element now incremented by 1.
- The third line increments the value of `operations` by 1, making it 2.

All other variables remain unchanged. The heap is still a heapified list of n/2 positive integers, but the smallest element has been incremented by n/2 + 2 times. The value of `current_median` is still greater than or equal to the new value of `heap[0]`, and `heap[0]` is still less than or equal to `current_median`.
