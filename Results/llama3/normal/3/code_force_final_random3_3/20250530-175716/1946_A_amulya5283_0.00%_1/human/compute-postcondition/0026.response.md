Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2 and the new value of operations which is n/2 + 1, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + n/2 + 1 times and heap[0] is less than current_median, operations is 2**

The code executes two lines that affect the state of the program. The first line removes the smallest element from the heap and the second line adds the smallest element incremented by 1 back to the heap. The value of operations is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
