The variables in the loop head are heap and current_median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables heap and current_median. If heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, heap[0] must be less than or equal to current_median. heap[0] being less than or equal to current_median does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to heap[0] is less than current_median. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the value of operations which is n/2, n is an even positive integer equal to the first element of the first test case in test_cases, arr is a sorted list of n positive integers equal to the second element of the first test case in test_cases, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is a positive integer greater than or equal to the new value of heap[0], heap is a heapified list of n/2 positive integers equal to the second half of arr except for the smallest element which has been incremented by n/2 + 2 times, operations is 2, heap[0] is less than current_median**
