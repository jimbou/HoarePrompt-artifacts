Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list**.

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `results` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables, `t` and `test_cases`, remain unchanged. The `test_cases` list still contains multiple test cases, each with a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers.
