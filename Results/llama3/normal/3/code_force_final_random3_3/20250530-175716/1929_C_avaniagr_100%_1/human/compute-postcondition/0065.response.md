Postcondition: ***k, x, and a are integers, open(0) has at least 1 line, s is the second line in open(0). If x is less than k - 1, then 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + 1. If x is equal to k - 1, then 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + 2. If x is larger than k - 1, then z is calculated as k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 repeated x - k + 3 times, and x - k + 3 must be greater than or equal to 0. If a is greater than or equal to z, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
