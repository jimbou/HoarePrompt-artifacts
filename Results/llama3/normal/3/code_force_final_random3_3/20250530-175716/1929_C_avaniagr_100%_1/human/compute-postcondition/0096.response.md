Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers k, x, and a. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of k, x, and a, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met or 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases in the input and terminates after printing the results for all cases.**
