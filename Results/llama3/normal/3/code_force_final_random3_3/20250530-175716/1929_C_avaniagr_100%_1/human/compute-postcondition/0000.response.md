The only object in the loop head is the file object `open(0)`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object `open(0)`. If the file object has at least 2 lines (since the loop starts from the second line, `[1:]`), the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases, which means the file object `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines.

State: **`open(0)` has at least 2 lines**
