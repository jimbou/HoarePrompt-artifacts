Postcondition: **k, x, and a are integers that are the first, second, and third numbers in the third line of open(0), respectively, open(0) has at least 2 lines. If x is less than k - 1, then if a is greater than or equal to x + 1, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If x is equal to k - 1, then if a is greater than or equal to x + 2, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If x is not equal to k - 1 and x is greater than or equal to k - 3, then z is equal to k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1, i is x - k + 2, open(0) has at least 1 line, and if a is greater than or equal to z, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**
