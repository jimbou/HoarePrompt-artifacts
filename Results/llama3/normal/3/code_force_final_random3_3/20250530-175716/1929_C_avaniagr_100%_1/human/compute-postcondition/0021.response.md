To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `k`. The loop will execute if `x - k + 3` is greater than 0.

State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is `k - 2`, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than 0**
