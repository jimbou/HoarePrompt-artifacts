Output State: **k, x, and a are integers that are the first, second, and third numbers in the third line of open(0), respectively, open(0) has at least 2 lines.**

In this output state, the values of k, x, and a are updated to be the first, second, and third numbers in the third line of open(0), respectively. The fact that open(0) has at least 2 lines is still valid, but the third line has been consumed by the map function.
