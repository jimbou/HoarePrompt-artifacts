Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins for any integer n.

The program first checks if x is less than k - 1. If this is the case, then Sasha can place bets such that he is guaranteed to win any number of coins if he has at least x + 1 coins initially. This is because Sasha can place a bet of 1 coin, and if he wins, he will have k coins. If he loses, he can place a bet of 2 coins, and if he wins, he will have 2k coins. This process can be repeated until Sasha has at least n coins.

If x is equal to k - 1, then Sasha needs at least x + 2 coins initially to guarantee having at least n coins. This is because Sasha can place a bet of 1 coin, and if he wins, he will have k coins. If he loses, he can place a bet of 2 coins, and if he wins, he will have 2k coins. However, if he loses again, he will not have enough coins to place another bet, so he needs at least x + 2 coins initially.

If x is greater than k - 1, then Sasha needs at least z coins initially to guarantee having at least n coins, where z is calculated using the formula z = k - 2 + (z // (k - 1) + 1) for x - k + 3 iterations. This formula calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to have initially to guarantee having at least n coins.

The program correctly prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins for any integer n, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
