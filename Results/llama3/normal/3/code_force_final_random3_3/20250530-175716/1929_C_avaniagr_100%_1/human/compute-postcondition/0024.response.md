Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `x` is larger than or equal to `k`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than 0, `x` is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `x` is incremented by 1 is still valid, and the other preconditions that `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `x` is larger than or equal to `k`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than 0 are still satisfied.
