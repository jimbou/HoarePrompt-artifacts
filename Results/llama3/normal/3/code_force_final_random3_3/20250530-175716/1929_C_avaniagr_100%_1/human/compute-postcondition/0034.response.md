Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x - k + 3` times, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
