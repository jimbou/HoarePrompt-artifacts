Output: **k, x, and a are integers, open(0) has at least 1 line, s is the second line in open(0), the current value of z is k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... (x - k + 3 times), x - k + 3 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of i is x - k + 2, and a is greater than or equal to z, and 'YES' is printed**
