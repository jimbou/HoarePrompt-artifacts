Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins in a casino game with certain rules. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers k, x, and a. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of k, x, and a, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met or 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is based on the following rules:

* If x < k - 1, Sasha can guarantee winning if he has at least x + 1 coins initially.
* If x == k - 1, Sasha can guarantee winning if he has at least x + 2 coins initially.
* If x > k - 1, Sasha can guarantee winning if he has at least z coins initially, where z is calculated using a formula that takes into account the number of consecutive losses and the increase in bet amount.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the rules of the casino game. The program also handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where x < k - 1, x == k - 1, and x > k - 1.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
