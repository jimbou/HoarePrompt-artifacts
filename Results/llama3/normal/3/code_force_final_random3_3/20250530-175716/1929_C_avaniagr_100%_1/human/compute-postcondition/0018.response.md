Postcondition: ***`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, and the current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, if `a` is less than `x + 2`, then 'NO' is being printed.***
