Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `s` is the second line in the `open(0)`, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, `x - k + 3` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
