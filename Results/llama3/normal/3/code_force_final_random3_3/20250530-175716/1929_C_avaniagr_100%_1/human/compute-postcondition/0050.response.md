To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `x - k + 3` is greater than 0.

State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `s` is the second line in the `open(0)`, `z` is `k - 2`, `x - k + 3` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
