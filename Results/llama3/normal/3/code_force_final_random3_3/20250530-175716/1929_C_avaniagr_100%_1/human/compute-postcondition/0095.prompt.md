Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers k, x, and a, where k is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), x is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x - k + 3` times, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *k, x, and a are integers, open(0) has at least 1 line, s is the second line in open(0). If x is less than k - 1, then 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + 1. If x is equal to k - 1, then 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to x + 2. If x is larger than k - 1, then z is calculated as k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 repeated x - k + 3 times, and x - k + 3 must be greater than or equal to 0. If a is greater than or equal to z, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k, x, and a are integers that are the first, second, and third numbers in the third line of open(0), respectively, open(0) has at least 2 lines. If x is less than k - 1, then if a is greater than or equal to x + 1, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If x is equal to k - 1, then if a is greater than or equal to x + 2, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If x is not equal to k - 1 and x is greater than or equal to k - 3, then z is equal to k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + ... + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1, i is x - k + 2, open(0) has at least 1 line, and if a is greater than or equal to z, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
