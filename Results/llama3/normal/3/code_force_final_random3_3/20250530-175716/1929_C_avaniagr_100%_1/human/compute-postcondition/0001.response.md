Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `open(0)` has at least 1 line**

In this output state, the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` have been assigned integer values from the input string `s`, which has been split into three parts. The `open(0)` file object, which represents the standard input, still has at least one line remaining, as only one line was consumed by the `map` function to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`.
