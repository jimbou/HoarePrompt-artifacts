Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, i is equal to t, n is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the input string, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in a. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the character after the first '1' in string a is not '1', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all the test cases (i.e., t times), and the final state of the variables is as follows: i is equal to t, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations; n and a are equal to the input integer and string, respectively, from the last test case; and count is equal to the number of '1' characters in the last input string. The output is determined based on the value of count, following the same conditions as before.
