The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). Since `t` is assigned the value of the first line of the first test case, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The second line of the first test case, which contains a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= n <= 50), is still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one line containing a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= n <= 50).**
