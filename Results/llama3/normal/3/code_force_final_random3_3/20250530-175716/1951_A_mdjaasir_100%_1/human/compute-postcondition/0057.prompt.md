Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one line containing a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= n <= 50).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a string, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in a. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2, then if the character immediately after the first '1' in a is not '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the character after the first '1' in a is '1', 'NO' is printed. If count is not equal to 2 and is not an even number, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, i is 1, n is an integer, a is a string, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in a. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the character after the first '1' in a is not '1', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input integer, a is a string equal to the input string, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in a. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the character after the first '1' in string a is not '1', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
