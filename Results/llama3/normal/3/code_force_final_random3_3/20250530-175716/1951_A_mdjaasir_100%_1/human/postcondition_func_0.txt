This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then checks the number of '1' characters in the binary string and prints 'YES' if the count is 0, or if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is 2 and the character after the first '1' is not '1'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
