You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1.
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, i is mid - 1, for all integers j in the range [0, mid), arr[left + j] is small_element + j, cliquess[left + j] is clique.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr is a list of length at least right + 1 with arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i, cliquess is a list of length at least right + 1 with cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is 0, i is not_mid - 1

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
