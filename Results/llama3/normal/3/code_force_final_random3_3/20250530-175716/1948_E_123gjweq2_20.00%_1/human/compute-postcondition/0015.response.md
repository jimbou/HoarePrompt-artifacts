Functionality: **The function takes in two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, and three integers, `left`, `right`, and `clique`, as input. It then modifies the elements of `arr` and `cliquess` within the range `[left, right]` by assigning values from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in an alternating pattern, while also assigning the value of `clique` to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`. The function does not return any value.**
