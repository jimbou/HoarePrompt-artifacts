This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the ceiling of n divided by k and creates two lists of length n, arr and cliquess, where the elements from index i * k to min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1) are set to i + 1, and the rest are zeros. The function then prints the list arr, the calculated ceiling value, and the list cliquess. The final state of the program is that it has printed the modified list arr, the ceiling value, and the list cliquess, with the last k elements of cliquess being the ceiling value.
