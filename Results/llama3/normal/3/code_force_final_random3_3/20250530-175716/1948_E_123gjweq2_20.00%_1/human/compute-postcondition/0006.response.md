Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, i is 2, arr[left] is small_element, cliquess[left] is clique, arr[left + i] is small_element + i, cliquess[left + i] is clique**

The code snippet does not modify any variables, so the output state remains the same as the initial state. The values of all variables, including left, right, clique, arr, cliquess, small_element, big_element, mid, not_mid, and i, remain unchanged.
