Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr is a list of length at least right + 1 with arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i, cliquess is a list of length at least right + 1 with cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is 0, i is not_mid - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the loop counter `i` has reached its final value, which is `not_mid - 1`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged. The loop has iterated `not_mid` times, and the values of `arr` and `cliquess` have been updated accordingly.
