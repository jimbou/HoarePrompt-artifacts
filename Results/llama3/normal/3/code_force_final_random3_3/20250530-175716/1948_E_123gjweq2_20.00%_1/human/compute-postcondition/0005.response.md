To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(mid):`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left < right`
* `clique` is a positive integer
* `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of length at least `right + 1`
* `small_element` is `left + 1`
* `big_element` is `right + 1`
* `mid` is at least 2
* `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`
* `i` is 1
* `arr[left]` is `small_element`
* `cliquess[left]` is `clique`
* `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`
* `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop head `for i in range(mid):`. The only object in the loop head is `i`, which is currently 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left < right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of length at least `right + 1`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is at least 2, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is 2, `arr[left]` is `small_element`, `cliquess[left]` is `clique`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`**
