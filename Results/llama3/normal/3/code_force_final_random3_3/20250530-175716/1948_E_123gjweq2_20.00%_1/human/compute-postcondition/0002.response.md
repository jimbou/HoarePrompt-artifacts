Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is at least 1, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, i is 0, arr[left] is small_element, cliquess[left] is clique.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The lists `arr` and `cliquess` still have a length of at least `right` + 1. The variable `i` is still 0. The code modifies the `left`-th index of `arr` to be `small_element` (which is `left` + 1) and the `left`-th index of `cliquess` to be `clique`.
