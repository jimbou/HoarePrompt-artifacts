Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. A clique is a set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. `func_1` calculates the number of cliques required based on the input parameters `n` and `k`, and then calls `make_array` to assign values to the vertices and partition the graph.

`make_array` assigns values to the vertices in an alternating pattern, starting from the smallest and largest available values and moving towards the middle. This pattern ensures that the difference between the values of any two vertices in the same clique is minimized, which in turn minimizes the number of cliques required.

The program's output consists of three lines: the assigned values for the vertices, the number of cliques, and the partitioning of the graph into cliques.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program appears to be correct. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to assign values and partition the graph. The `make_array` function correctly assigns values in an alternating pattern and updates the `cliquess` list accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
