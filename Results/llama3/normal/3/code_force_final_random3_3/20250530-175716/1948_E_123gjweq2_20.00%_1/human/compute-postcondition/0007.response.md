Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid, i is mid - 1, for all integers j in the range [0, mid), arr[left + j] is small_element + j, cliquess[left + j] is clique.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` has reached its final value, which is `mid - 1`. The loop has iterated over the range `[0, mid)` and has updated the values of `arr` and `cliquess` at indices `left + j` for all `j` in this range. Specifically, `arr[left + j]` is now equal to `small_element + j` and `cliquess[left + j]` is now equal to `clique`.
