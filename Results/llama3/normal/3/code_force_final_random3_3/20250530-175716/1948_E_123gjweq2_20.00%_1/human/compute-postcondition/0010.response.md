The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `not_mid` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr is a list of length at least right + 1 with arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i, cliquess is a list of length at least right + 1 with cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is greater than 1, i is 1**
