Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly assigns distinct integers to each vertex in the graph, and then partitions the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques. The program also correctly prints the assigned integers and the partition of the graph into cliques.

The program uses a greedy approach to assign integers to the vertices. It first calculates the number of cliques needed, which is the ceiling of n divided by k. Then, it assigns integers to the vertices in each clique, starting from the smallest possible integer and incrementing it for each vertex in the clique. The program also keeps track of the clique number for each vertex.

The program correctly handles the case where n is not a multiple of k, by assigning the remaining vertices to the last clique.

The program also correctly prints the assigned integers and the partition of the graph into cliques, as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
