According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`. So for the loop to be executed, `not_mid` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is greater than 0, i is 0**
