Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to each vertex in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required to partition the graph and initializes two arrays: `arr` to store the assigned integers and `cliquess` to store the clique assignments for each vertex. It then calls the `make_array` function to populate these arrays.

The `make_array` function takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It calculates the range of vertices to be assigned to the current clique and assigns the integers in a way that minimizes the number of cliques required. The integers are assigned in a zigzag pattern, with the smallest and largest integers being assigned first, followed by the middle integers.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of the `ceil` function to calculate the number of cliques ensures that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The `make_array` function's zigzag pattern assignment strategy is also correct, as it minimizes the number of cliques required.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are not defined within the scope of the `make_array` function. To fix this, these arrays should be defined as global variables or passed as parameters to the `make_array` function.

Correctness: **False** (due to the scope issue with `arr` and `cliquess`)
