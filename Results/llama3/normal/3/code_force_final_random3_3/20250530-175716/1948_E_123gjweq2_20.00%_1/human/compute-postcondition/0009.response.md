Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr is a list of length at least right + 1 with arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i, cliquess is a list of length at least right + 1 with cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is greater than 0, i is 0**

The code modifies the values of `arr[left + mid + i]` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. The value of `arr[left + mid + i]` becomes `big_element - i`, which is `right + 1 - i`. The value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` becomes `clique`. No other variables are affected.
