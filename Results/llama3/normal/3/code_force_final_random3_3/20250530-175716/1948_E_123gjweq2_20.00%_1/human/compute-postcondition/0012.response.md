State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr is a list of length at least right + 1 with arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i, cliquess is a list of length at least right + 1 with cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is greater than 1, i is 2**
