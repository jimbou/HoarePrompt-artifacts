Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2)**.

The code calculates the values of `small_element` and `big_element` based on the initial values of `left` and `right`. It then calculates `mid` as half of the difference between `big_element` and `small_element`, and `not_mid` as the total range (`right - left + 1`) minus `mid`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess` remain unchanged.
