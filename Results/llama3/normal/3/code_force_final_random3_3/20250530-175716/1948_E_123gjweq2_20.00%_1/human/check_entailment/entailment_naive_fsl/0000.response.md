Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It assigns distinct integers to each vertex in the graph, and then partitions the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

The program uses a greedy approach to assign the integers. It divides the vertices into groups of size `k`, and then assigns the integers in a way that minimizes the number of cliques. The `make_array` function is used to assign the integers to each group of vertices.

The program also correctly prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to handle all possible inputs correctly, including edge cases such as `n = 2` and `k = 1`.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
