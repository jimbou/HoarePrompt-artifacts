Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr is a list of length at least right + 1 with arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i, cliquess is a list of length at least right + 1 with cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is greater than 1, i is 2**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to specific elements in the `arr` and `cliquess` lists. The first line assigns the value of `big_element - i` to `arr[left + mid + i]`, and the second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Since the initial state already specifies that `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` and `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique`, these assignments do not change the values of these elements. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
