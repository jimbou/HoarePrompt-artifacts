#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer, a and b are non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer, 0 <= k <= min(n, b).
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the non-negative integer 'ans', which is equal to k * b + (n - k) * a, is less than or equal to the product of 'n' and the maximum of 'a' and 'b'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a weighted sum of two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b', based on the values of 'k' and 'n', is less than or equal to the product of 'n' and the maximum of 'a' and 'b'. It takes four parameters: 'k', 'a', 'b', and 'n', and returns a boolean value indicating whether the weighted sum is within the specified limit.
