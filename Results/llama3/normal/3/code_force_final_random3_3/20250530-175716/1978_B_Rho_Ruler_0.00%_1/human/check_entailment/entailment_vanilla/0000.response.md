Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit. However, there are several issues with the program.

1. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented. It is supposed to calculate the profit for a given value of k, but it is not doing so correctly. The profit should be calculated as the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns and the usual price for the remaining (n-k) buns.

2. The binary search approach is not necessary for this problem. The optimal value of k can be found by simply iterating over all possible values of k from 0 to min(n, b) and calculating the profit for each value.

3. The condition in the `while` loop is incorrect. The loop should continue until `low` is greater than `high`, not until `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

4. The `ans` variable is initialized to -1, which is not a valid value for the profit. It should be initialized to 0 or a very large negative number.

5. The `print` statement at the end of the program is printing the value of `ans`, which is not the maximum profit. The maximum profit should be calculated by calling the `func_1` function with the optimal value of k.

Correctness: **False**
