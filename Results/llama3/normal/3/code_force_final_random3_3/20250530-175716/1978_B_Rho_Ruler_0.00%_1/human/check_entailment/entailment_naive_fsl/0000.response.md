Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` is used to determine whether a given value of k is valid, but it does not correctly calculate the profit.

The function `func_1` calculates the profit as `k * b + (n - k) * a`, but this is not the correct formula for the profit. The correct formula for the profit is the sum of the prices of the first k buns, which is `b + (b - 1) + ... + (b - k + 1)`, plus the price of the remaining (n - k) buns, which is `(n - k) * a`.

The program also uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of k, but this is not necessary. The maximum value of k can be found by simply iterating over all possible values of k from 0 to n.

A correct solution would be to iterate over all possible values of k from 0 to n, calculate the profit for each value of k using the correct formula, and return the maximum profit found.

Here is an example of a correct solution:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns.
