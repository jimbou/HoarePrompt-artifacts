Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k, which is the number of buns sold at a modified price.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented. It calculates the total profit for a given value of k, but it does not compare it with the maximum possible profit. Instead, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the total profit is less than or equal to the product of n and the maximum of a and b. This is not the correct condition to determine the optimal value of k.

2. The binary search approach is not correctly implemented. The program updates the `low` and `high` variables based on the result of `func_1`, but it does not correctly determine the optimal value of k.

3. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit. It prints the value of `ans`, which is the optimal value of k, but it does not calculate the corresponding maximum profit.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
