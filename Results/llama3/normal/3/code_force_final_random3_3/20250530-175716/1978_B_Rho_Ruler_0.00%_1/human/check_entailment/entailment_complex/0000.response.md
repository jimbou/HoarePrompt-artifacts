Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit. However, the program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented.

The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the profit for a given value of k and return a boolean value indicating whether the profit is less than or equal to the maximum possible profit. However, the function is actually calculating the profit and comparing it to the product of n and the maximum of a and b, which is not the correct condition.

The correct condition should be to compare the profit to the maximum possible profit, which is the product of n and the maximum of a and b. However, the function is not correctly calculating the maximum possible profit.

Moreover, the binary search approach is not necessary in this problem. The optimal value of k can be found by simply iterating over all possible values of k from 0 to min(n, b) and calculating the profit for each value of k.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
