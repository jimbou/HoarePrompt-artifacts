Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = str(input(''))
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z of arr is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z of arr is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains t-6 test cases, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z of arr is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
