Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains t-6 test cases, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z of arr is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `arr` is updated to a string read from the input. The value of `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. The value of `y` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. The value of `z` is updated to a substring of `arr` starting from the index `x` to the index `n - y`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, as two inputs are read from `stdin`. The number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` of `arr` is being printed.
