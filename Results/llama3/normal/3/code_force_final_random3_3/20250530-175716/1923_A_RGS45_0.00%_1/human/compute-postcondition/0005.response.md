The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0 and at least 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is a substring of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` of `arr` is being printed**
