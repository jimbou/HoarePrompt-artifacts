Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 and at least t, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z of arr is being printed**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be an integer larger than 0 and at least equal to its initial value, `n` will be an integer, `arr` will be a string, `x` and `y` will be integers, `z` will be a substring of `arr`, there will be no more test cases in the standard input (`stdin`), and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` of `arr` will be printed.
