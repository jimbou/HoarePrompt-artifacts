Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string of binary digits `arr`.
3. It correctly finds the first occurrence of '1' from the left (`x`) and the first occurrence of '1' from the right (`y`) using the `find` method.
4. It extracts the substring `z` between the first and last occurrences of '1' using slicing.
5. It correctly counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` using the `count` method and prints the result.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. It finds the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them by counting the number of '0's in the substring between the first and last occurrences of '1'.

Correctness: **True**
