Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 and at least 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the input, which is the first test case. The variable `arr` is assigned a string value from the input, which is the second test case. The variable `x` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr`. The variable `y` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the reversed string `arr`. The variable `z` is assigned a substring of `arr` starting from the index `x` to the index `n - y`. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases as two test cases have been consumed by the code.
