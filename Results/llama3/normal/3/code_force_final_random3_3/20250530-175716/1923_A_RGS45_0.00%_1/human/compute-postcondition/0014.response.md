Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n space-separated binary digits (0s and 1s). It then finds the first and last occurrences of '1' in the string, extracts the substring between these two occurrences, and prints the number of '0's in this substring. The function repeats this process for each test case, ultimately consuming all input from standard input and producing a series of output values representing the count of '0's in each substring.**
