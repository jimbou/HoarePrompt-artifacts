Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 100, 1 and 30, and 1 and 30 respectively, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values read from the first line of input from stdin. The range of values for `n`, `a`, and `b` is still between 1 and 100, 1 and 30, and 1 and 30 respectively. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, as one line has been read and processed.
