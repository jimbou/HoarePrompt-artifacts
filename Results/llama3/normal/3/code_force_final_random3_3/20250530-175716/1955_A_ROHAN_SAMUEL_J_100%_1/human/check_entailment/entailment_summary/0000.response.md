Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts based on the prices a and b. The program handles both odd and even values of n and considers the relationship between 2a and b to determine the minimum cost.

The program's logic is as follows:

- If n is odd, it checks if 2a is less than b. If true, it calculates the cost as a * n (buying all yogurts at the regular price). Otherwise, it calculates the cost as n // 2 * b + a (buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price).
- If n is even, it checks if 2a is less than b. If true, it calculates the cost as a * n (buying all yogurts at the regular price). Otherwise, it calculates the cost as n // 2 * b (buying all yogurts at the promotion price).

The program's logic aligns with the problem description and the example provided. It correctly handles all possible scenarios and calculates the minimum cost accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
