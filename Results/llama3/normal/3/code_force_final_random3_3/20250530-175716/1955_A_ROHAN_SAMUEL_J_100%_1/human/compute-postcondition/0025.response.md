Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed.***
