Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 100, 1 and 30, and 1 and 30 respectively, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` divided by 2 times `b` is being printed.***
