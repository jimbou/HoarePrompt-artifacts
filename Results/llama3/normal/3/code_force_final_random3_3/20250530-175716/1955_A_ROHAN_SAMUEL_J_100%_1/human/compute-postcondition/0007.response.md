The code prints the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`. 

Here, `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2, which is the largest whole number less than or equal to `n/2`. Since `n` is an odd integer, `n // 2` will be the integer part of `n/2`, which is the largest integer less than `n/2`. 

Then, this value is multiplied by `b`, which is an integer between 1 and 30. 

Finally, `a` is added to this product. `a` is also an integer between 1 and 30.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b + a (where n is an odd integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, and b is an integer between 1 and 30)**
