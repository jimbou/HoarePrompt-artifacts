The code prints the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`. 

Based on the precondition, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is even, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30. 

Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer (because the division is integer division, which discards the remainder and returns the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are not taken into account). 

Therefore, the expression `n // 2 * b` will be the product of an integer (`n // 2`) and `b`, which will also be an integer.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 1500 (which is the product of n // 2 and b)**
