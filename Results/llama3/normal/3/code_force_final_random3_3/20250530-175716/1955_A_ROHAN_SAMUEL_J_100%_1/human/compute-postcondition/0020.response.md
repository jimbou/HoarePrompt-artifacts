The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively.

In the initial state, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `b` is an integer between 1 and 30. However, the code overwrites these values with the new values read from stdin.

Since stdin contains at least 1 line of input that is a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `t` lines that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30), the first line of input is read and its values are assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
