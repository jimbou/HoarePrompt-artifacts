Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts on promotion `b`.
3. If `n` is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`). If it is, the program prints the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`). Otherwise, it prints the total cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) plus the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price (`a`).
4. If `n` is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`). If it is, the program prints the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`). Otherwise, it prints the total cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices.

Correctness: **True**
