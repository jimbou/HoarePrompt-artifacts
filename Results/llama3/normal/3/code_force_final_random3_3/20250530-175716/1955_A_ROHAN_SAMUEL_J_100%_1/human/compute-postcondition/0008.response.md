The code prints the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`, which is the product of the integer division of `n` by 2, multiplied by `b`, plus `a`. Since `n` is an odd integer, `n // 2` will be the integer part of the division, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number. The result of this expression is then printed.

Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains at least 1 line of input that is a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and t-1 lines that contain three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). The current value of `n` is an odd integer. Additionally, 2 times `a` is larger than or equal to `b`, and the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is being printed, which is the product of the integer division of `n` by 2, multiplied by `b`, plus `a`.**
