Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2:
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
    elif 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains at least 1 line of input that is a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and t-1 lines that contain three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). If `n` is odd, then if 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even, then if 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the product of the integer division of `n` by 2 and `b` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `n` is odd and 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is odd and 2 times `a` is not less than `b`, the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even and 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is even and 2 times `a` is not less than `b`, the integer part of the division of `n` by 2 multiplied by `b` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 100, 1 and 30, and 1 and 30 respectively, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `n` is odd, if 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the product of half of `n` and `b` added to `a` is printed. If `n` is even, if 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` divided by 2 times `b` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
