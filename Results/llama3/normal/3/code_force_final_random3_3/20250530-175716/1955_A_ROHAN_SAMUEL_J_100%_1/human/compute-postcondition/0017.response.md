Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains at least 1 line of input that is a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and t-1 lines that contain three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). The value of `n` is even. If 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the product of the integer division of `n` by 2 and `b` is printed.***
