Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases for buying yogurts, considering whether the number of yogurts (n) is odd or even and the relationship between the price of one yogurt (a) and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b). 

For each test case, the program calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the values of n, a, and b. 

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible scenarios. 

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
