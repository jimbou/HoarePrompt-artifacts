Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three integers n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the values of n, a, and b, considering whether n is odd or even and the relationship between 2a and b. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding minimum costs.**
