The code prints the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `b` is an integer between 1 and 30.

The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, which means it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number. This result is then multiplied by `b`.

Since `n` is between 1 and 100, `n // 2` will be between 0 and 50. Multiplying this result by `b`, which is between 1 and 30, will give a result between 0 and 1500.

Therefore, the code will print an integer between 0 and 1500, which is the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 1500 (result of n // 2 * b)**
