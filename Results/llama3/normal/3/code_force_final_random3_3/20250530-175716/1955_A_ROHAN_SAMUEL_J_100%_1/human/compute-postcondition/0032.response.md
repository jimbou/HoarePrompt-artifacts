The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is at least 1, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input. So for the loop to be executed one more time, stdin must contain `t` lines of input and `int(input())` is at least 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, and stdin contains `t` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
