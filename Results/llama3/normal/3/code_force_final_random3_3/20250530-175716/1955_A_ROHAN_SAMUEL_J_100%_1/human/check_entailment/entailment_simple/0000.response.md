Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

The program then checks if the number of yogurts (n) is odd or even. If n is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is less than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If 2 * a is less than b, it prints the product of a and n, which is the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it prints the product of half of n and b added to a, which is the minimum cost of buying n yogurts with one yogurt at the regular price and the rest at the promotion price.

If n is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is less than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If 2 * a is less than b, it prints the product of a and n, which is the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it prints the product of half of n and b, which is the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the minimum cost of buying n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
