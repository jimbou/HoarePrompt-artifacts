Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and the current value of `n` is an odd integer. `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and the current value of `a` is less than half of `b`. `b` is an integer between 1 and 30. stdin contains at least 1 line of input that is a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and t-1 lines that contain three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30).***
