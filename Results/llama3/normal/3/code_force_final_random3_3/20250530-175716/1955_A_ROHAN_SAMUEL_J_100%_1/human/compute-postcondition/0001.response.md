Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains at least 1 line of input that is a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and t-1 lines that contain three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30)**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the first three integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains at least 1 line of input that is a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and t-1 lines that contain three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30).
