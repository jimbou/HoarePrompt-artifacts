Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: when n is odd and when n is even. 

When n is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

When n is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys all yogurts at the promotion price.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost in each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
