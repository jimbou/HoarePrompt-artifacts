Output State: **The loop has executed for a number of times equal to the value of the variable `t` read from the first line of stdin. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 100, 1 and 30, and 1 and 30 respectively, stdin contains `t` lines of input that contain three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `n` is odd, if 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the product of half of `n` and `b` added to `a` is printed. If `n` is even, if 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` divided by 2 times `b` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has run for a number of times equal to the value of `t` read from the first line of stdin. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are within their respective ranges, and the input has been read from stdin. The loop has printed the results of the calculations based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
