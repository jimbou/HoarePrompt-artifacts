The code prints the product of `a` and `n`. Where `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and the current value of `a` is less than half of `b`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and the current value of `n` is even.

Output: **[a * n] (where a is an integer between 1 and 30 and less than half of b, and n is an even integer between 1 and 100)**
