Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 3, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 1, `n - j` must be greater than 1. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then this condition is not valid anymore. Otherwise, `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are no longer valid. The stdin still contains an integer input `t`, and the list `s` still contains characters from the first input string. The length of the string `n` is still at least 3, and `j` is still half of `n`. The value of `k` is still 1, and `n - j` is still greater than 1.
