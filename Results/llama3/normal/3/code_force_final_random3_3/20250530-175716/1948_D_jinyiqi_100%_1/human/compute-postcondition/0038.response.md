Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, 1, 2 or 3, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is '?', then `count` is 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
