Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 or 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0, `n - j` must be at least 1. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, or either `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
