Output State: **The program returns nothing because there is no return statement with a value. However, the value of count * 2, which is equal to 2 * j, has been printed. The value of j is n // 2, where n is the length of the first input string and must be at least 2. The value of count is equal to j, and it is either 0 or 1.**
