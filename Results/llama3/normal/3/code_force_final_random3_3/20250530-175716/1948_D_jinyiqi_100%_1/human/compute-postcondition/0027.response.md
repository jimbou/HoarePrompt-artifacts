Output State: **`count` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0. The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input, an integer t between 1 and 1000. The list `s` still contains characters from the first input string, and its length `n` is still at least 2. The value of `j` is still `n // 2 - 1`, and `k` is still 0. The relationship between `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` remains the same, where `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'.
