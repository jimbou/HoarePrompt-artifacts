The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1. So, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`. 
State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`**
