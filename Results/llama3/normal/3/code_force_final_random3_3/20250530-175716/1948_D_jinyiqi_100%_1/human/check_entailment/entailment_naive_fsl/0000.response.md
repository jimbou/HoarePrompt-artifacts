Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for tandem repeats of length j. If a tandem repeat of length j is found, it prints the length of the repeat (which is 2*j) and returns. If no tandem repeat is found for any length, it prints 0.

The program correctly handles the case where the string contains question marks, which can be replaced with any lowercase Latin letter to form a tandem repeat. It also correctly handles the case where the string does not contain any tandem repeats, in which case it prints 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases. It checks for tandem repeats of all possible lengths, from the longest to the shortest, and it correctly handles the case where a tandem repeat is found. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
