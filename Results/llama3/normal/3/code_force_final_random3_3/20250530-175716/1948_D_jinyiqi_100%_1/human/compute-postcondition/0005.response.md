Output State: **`count` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, `n - j` must be greater than 0, and either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.**

The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). The list `s` remains the same, and `n` is still the length of the first input string, which must be at least 2. The value of `j` is still `n // 2`, and `k` is still 0. The condition `n - j` must be greater than 0 is still valid. Also, either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.
