Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 3, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2, `n - j` must be greater than 1. If `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]` and neither `s[k]` nor `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is 0. Otherwise, `count` is 1, 2, or 3.***
