To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n // 2` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2.

State: **stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), s is a list of characters from the first input string, n is the length of the first input string and must be at least 2, j is n // 2**
