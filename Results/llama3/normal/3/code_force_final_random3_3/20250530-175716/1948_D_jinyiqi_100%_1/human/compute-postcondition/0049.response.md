Output State: **`count` is 1 or 2, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 1, `n - j` must be at least 2. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, or either `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so it can be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `count` being 1 or 2 is still dependent on the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`. If they are equal or either of them is '?', then `count` is 2, otherwise, it is 1.
