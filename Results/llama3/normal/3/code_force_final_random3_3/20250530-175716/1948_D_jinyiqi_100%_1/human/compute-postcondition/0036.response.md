Output State: **`count` is 1, 2 or 3, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters from the first input string, `n` is the length of the first input string and must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`**

The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` was 0, 1 or 2, so the new value of `count` is 1, 2 or 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.
