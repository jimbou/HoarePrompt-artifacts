Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality by maintaining a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of a sequence of equal elements in the input list. It then uses binary search to find the appropriate tuple for each query and prints the indices of two different elements if they exist, or -1 -1 if they do not.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query range is within a single sequence of equal elements, or when the query range spans multiple sequences of equal elements. It also handles the case where the query range is outside the bounds of the input list.

The use of binary search to find the appropriate tuple for each query makes the program efficient, with a time complexity of O(q log n), where q is the number of queries and n is the length of the input list.

Correctness: **True**
