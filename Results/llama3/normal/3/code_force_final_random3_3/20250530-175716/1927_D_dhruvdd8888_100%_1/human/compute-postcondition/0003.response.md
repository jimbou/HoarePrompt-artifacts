Output State: **N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The current value of nums[i] is not equal to num.**

The code first appends a tuple to the list `arr`, containing the values `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. Since `s` is 0, the tuple becomes `(1, 0, num)`. Then, it assigns the value of `i` to `s`, making `s` equal to 0. The values of `N`, `nums`, `e`, and `num` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also unchanged because it is not modified by the code. The stdin remains the same as it was not used in the code.
