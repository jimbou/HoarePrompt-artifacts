Output State: **N is at least 2, i is 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 2, e is 0, num is the current value of nums[i], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) and either (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num) or (2, 1, num) depending on whether the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num.**

The code appends a tuple to the list `arr` with values `(1 + s, i, num)`, where `s` is 1 and `i` is 2, so the tuple becomes `(2, 2, num)`. Then, it updates the value of `s` to be equal to `i`, which is 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains the newly appended tuple, in addition to its previous contents, which depended on whether the current value of `nums[i]` was equal to the previous value of `num`.
