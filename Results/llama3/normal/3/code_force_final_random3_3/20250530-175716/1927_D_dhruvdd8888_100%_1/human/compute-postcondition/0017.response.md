Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least one test case minus the two integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, and LA is the second last index of arr.**

In this output state, the values of `s` and `e` have been updated based on the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The value of `s` is now the second element of this tuple, and the value of `e` is now the third element of this tuple. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less test case as two integers were read by the input() function.
