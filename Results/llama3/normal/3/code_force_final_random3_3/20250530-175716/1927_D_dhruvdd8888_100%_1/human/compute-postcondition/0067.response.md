Based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet, we can determine what will be printed when the statement executes.

The code snippet is simply `print(-1, -1)`. This statement does not depend on any variables or objects defined in the initial state. It directly prints the values -1 and -1.

Therefore, the output will be the literal values -1 and -1, without any relation to the variables or objects described in the initial state.

Output: **-1 -1**
