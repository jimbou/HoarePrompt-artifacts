Output: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least two test cases minus the four integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, LA is the second last index of arr, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, l is the first integer read from stdin, r is the second integer read from stdin, and this is printed: s (which is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr) and e + 1 (where e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
