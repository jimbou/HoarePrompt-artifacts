The code prints the second element `s` of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and the value of the third element `e` of the same tuple plus one.

Since `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, its value is `1 + s` where `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. 

Similarly, `e` is the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, its value is `num` which is the last integer in `nums`.

Output: **1 + s (where s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr), num + 1 (where num is the last integer in nums)**
