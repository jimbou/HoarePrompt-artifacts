Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer N, a list of N integers, an integer Q, and Q lines of queries. For each query, it finds the first and last indices of the first sequence of identical integers that overlaps with the query range [l, r]. If no such sequence exists, it returns (-1, -1). If the sequence starts after the query range, it returns the indices of the sequence that immediately precedes the query range. If the sequence ends before the query range, it returns the indices of the sequence that immediately follows the query range. The function prints the result for each query.**
