To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. If `N` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is at least 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`N` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of N+1 integers, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in `nums`, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
