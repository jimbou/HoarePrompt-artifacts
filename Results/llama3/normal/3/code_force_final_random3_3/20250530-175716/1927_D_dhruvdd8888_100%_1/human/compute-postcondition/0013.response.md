Output State: **N is at least 2, i is 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, num is the current value of nums[i], s is either 1 or 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) and either (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num) or (2, 1, num) if the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, otherwise arr is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, num).**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to the current value of `nums[i]`. The values of `N`, `i`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The values of `s`, `e`, and `arr` depend on whether the current value of `nums[i]` is equal to the previous value of `num`. If they are not equal, `s` is 2, `e` is 0, and `arr` contains tuples `(1 + s, i, num)`, `(1, 0, num)`, and `(2, 1, num)`. If they are equal, `s` is 1, `e` is 0, and `arr` contains only the tuple `(2, 1, num)`.
