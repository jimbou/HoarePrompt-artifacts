The code prints the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr plus one. Where eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the second last index of arr, l is the first integer read from stdin, and r is the second integer read from stdin.
Output: **s (the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr), e+1 (the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr plus one)**
