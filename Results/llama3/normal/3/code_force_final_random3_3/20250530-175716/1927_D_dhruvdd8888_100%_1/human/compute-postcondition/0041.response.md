Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least one test case minus the two integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, LA is the second last index of arr, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order.**

The code reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `l` and `r`. It then uses the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr` to maintain sorted order, assigning this index to `eli`. Finally, it extracts the second and third elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, assigning them to `s` and `e`, respectively. The values of `N`, `nums`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged, as do the values of `l` and `r` after they are assigned. The value of `stdin` is reduced by two integers.
