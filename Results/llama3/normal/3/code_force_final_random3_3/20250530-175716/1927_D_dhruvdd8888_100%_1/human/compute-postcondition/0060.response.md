Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables `s` and `e` as follows:

* `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
* `e` is the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

Since `LA` is the second last index of `arr`, `min(eli, LA)` will be the index of the second last tuple in `arr`. Therefore, `s` and `e` are the second and third elements of the second last tuple in `arr`, respectively.

The second last tuple in `arr` is of the form `(1 + s, i, num)`, where `i` is an index such that `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`. Therefore, `s` is equal to the first element of the tuple minus 1, and `e` is equal to the third element of the tuple, which is `num`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(s - 1, s)`

The first argument to the print statement is `s - 1`, which is equal to the first element of the second last tuple in `arr` minus 2. The second argument is `s`, which is equal to the first element of the second last tuple in `arr` minus 1.

Therefore, the print statement will print the values of `s - 1` and `s`, which are the first element of the second last tuple in `arr` minus 2 and minus 1, respectively.

Output: **(1 + s - 2, 1 + s - 1) (where s is the first element of the second last tuple in arr minus 1)**
