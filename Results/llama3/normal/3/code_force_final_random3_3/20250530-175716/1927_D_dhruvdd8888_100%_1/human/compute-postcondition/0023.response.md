The code prints the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`. 
Where `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `LA` is the second last index of `arr`. 
Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s - 1` and `s`. 
However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`.
Output: **s - 1 (where s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr), s (where s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
