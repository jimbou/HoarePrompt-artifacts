Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is N, e is 0, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, and LA is the second last index of arr.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least one test case minus the two integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, and LA is the second last index of arr. If s > l, then if s is either 1 or greater than r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of s minus 1 and the value of s are being printed. If s is less than or equal to l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than N or e is less than l, then s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least one test case minus the two integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, LA is the second last index of arr, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1 or s is greater than r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1, s is printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N or e is less than l, s and e+1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least two test cases minus the four integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, LA is the second last index of arr, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, l is the first integer read from stdin, r is the second integer read from stdin. If s is greater than l, then if s is 1 or s is greater than r, the values -1, -1 are being printed. Otherwise, the value of s - 1 and the value of s are being printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, then -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N or e is less than l, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
