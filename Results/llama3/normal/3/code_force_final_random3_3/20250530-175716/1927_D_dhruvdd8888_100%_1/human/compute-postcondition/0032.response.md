Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the values of `s` and `e + 1`.

`s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Since `s` is less than or equal to `l`, its value is within the range of the list `arr`.

`e` is the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The current value of `e` is less than `N` or the current value of `e` is less than `l`. This means that `e` is also within the range of the list `arr`.

When `e + 1` is printed, it will be the next integer value after `e`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `s` and the next integer value after `e`.

Output: **s (where s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr), e + 1 (where e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr and e + 1 is the next integer value after e)**
