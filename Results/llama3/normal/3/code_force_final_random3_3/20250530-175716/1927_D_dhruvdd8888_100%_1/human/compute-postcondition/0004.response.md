Postcondition: ***N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If the current value of nums[i] is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num).***
