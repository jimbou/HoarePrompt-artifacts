Output State: **N is at least 1, i is 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 1, e is 0, num is the current value of nums[i], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, then arr is a list containing two tuples (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num). Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, num).**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for the variable "num" which is now updated to be the current value of nums[i]. The value of arr remains dependent on whether the current value of nums[i] is equal to the previous value of num.
