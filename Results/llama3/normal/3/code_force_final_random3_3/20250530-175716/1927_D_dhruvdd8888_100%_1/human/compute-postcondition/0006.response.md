To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` is at least 0. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be at least 1.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of N+1 integers, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the second integer in `nums`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If the current value of `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, then `arr` is an empty list. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, `num`).**
