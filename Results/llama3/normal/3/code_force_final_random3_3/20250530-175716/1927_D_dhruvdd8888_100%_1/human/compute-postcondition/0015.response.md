Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is N, e is 0, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, and LA is the second last index of arr.**

In this output state, the value of LA is calculated as the second last index of arr because the length of arr is used to calculate LA, and the length of arr is the number of tuples in arr. The other variables remain unchanged because the code only calculates the value of LA and does not modify any other variables.
