Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, arr is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If the current value of nums[i] is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is at least 1, i is 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 1, e is 0, num is the current value of nums[i], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, then arr is a list containing two tuples (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num). Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, num).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is at least 2, i is 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, num is the current value of nums[i], s is either 1 or 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) and either (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num) or (2, 1, num) if the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, otherwise arr is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, num).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
