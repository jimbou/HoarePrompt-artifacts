Postcondition: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least two test cases minus the four integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, LA is the second last index of arr, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, l is the first integer read from stdin, r is the second integer read from stdin. If s is greater than l, then if s is 1 or s is greater than r, the values -1, -1 are being printed. Otherwise, the value of s - 1 and the value of s are being printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, then -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N or e is less than l, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.**
