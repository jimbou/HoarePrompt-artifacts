Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, arr is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of N is an integer, and the list nums contains N+1 integers. The variable s and e are both 0. The variable num is assigned the value of the first integer in nums. The list arr is empty. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case because the first test case has been read and processed by the code.
