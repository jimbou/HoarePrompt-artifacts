The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be at least 2.
State: **N is at least 2, i is 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 1, e is 0, num is the current value of nums[i], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, then arr is a list containing two tuples (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num). Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, num).**
