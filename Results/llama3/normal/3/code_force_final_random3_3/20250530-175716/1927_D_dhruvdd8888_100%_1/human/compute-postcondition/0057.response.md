Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least two test cases minus the four integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, LA is the second last index of arr, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, l is the first integer read from stdin, r is the second integer read from stdin.**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to l and r. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to l and r. So now stdin only contains at least two test cases minus the four integers read by input(). The second line finds the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order and assigns it to eli. The third line assigns the second and third elements of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr to s and e. The value of s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and the value of e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr. No other variables are affected.
