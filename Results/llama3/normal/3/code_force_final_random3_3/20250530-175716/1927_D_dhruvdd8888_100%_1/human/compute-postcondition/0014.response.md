Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is N, e is 0, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of N remains unchanged, the list of integers `nums` also remains unchanged, the variable `s` has been updated to the last index `N`, the variable `e` remains unchanged at 0, the variable `num` now holds the last integer in the list `nums`, and the list `arr` contains tuples for each index `i` where the value of `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`. The variable `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
