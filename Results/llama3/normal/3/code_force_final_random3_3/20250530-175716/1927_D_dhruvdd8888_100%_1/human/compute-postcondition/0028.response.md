Based on the precondition, the code `print(-1, -1)` will print the values -1 and -1.

The variables `N`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `stdin`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, and `r` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

The print statement simply prints the literal values -1 and -1, without any calculations or references to the variables or objects described in the precondition.

Output: **-1 -1**
