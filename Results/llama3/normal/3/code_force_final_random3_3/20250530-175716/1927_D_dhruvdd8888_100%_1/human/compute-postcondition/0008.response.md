Postcondition: ***N is at least 1, i is 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 1, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If the current value of nums[i] is not equal to num, then arr is a list containing two tuples (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num). Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, num).***
