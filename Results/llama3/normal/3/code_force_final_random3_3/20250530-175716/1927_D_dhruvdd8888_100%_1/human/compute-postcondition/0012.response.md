Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, i is 2, nums is a list of N+1 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, num is the current value of nums[i]. If the current value of nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, then s is 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) and either (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num) or (2, 1, num). Otherwise, s remains 1, e remains 0, and arr is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, num).***
