Output State: **N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in nums, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If the current value of nums[i] is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num).**

The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `num`. Since `i` is 0, `num` is now the first integer in `nums`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition for `arr` remains the same, but now it depends on the new value of `num`. If the current value of `nums[i]` (which is the first integer in `nums`) is equal to `num`, then `arr` is an empty list. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing one tuple `(1, 0, num)`.
