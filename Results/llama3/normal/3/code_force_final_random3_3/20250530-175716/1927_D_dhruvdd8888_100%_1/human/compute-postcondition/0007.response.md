Output State: **N is at least 1, i is 1, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 1, e is 0, num is the second integer in nums, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, arr is a list containing one tuple (2, 1, num) if the current value of nums[i] is equal to num, otherwise arr is a list containing two tuples (1, 0, num) and (2, 1, num).**

The code first appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains three values: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. Since `s` is initially 0, the first value in the tuple is 1. The second value is `i`, which is 1. The third value is `num`, which is the second integer in `nums`. If the current value of `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, then `arr` was initially an empty list, so it now contains only this tuple. Otherwise, `arr` already contained one tuple, so it now contains two tuples.

The second line of the code assigns the value of `i` to `s`. Since `i` is 1, `s` becomes 1.

The values of `N`, `nums`, `e`, and `num` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `stdin` is also not modified, as it is not used in the code.
