Output: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is the last integer in nums, stdin contains at least one test case minus the two integers read by input(), arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] is not equal to the previous value of num, LA is the second last index of arr, l is an integer, r is an integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, and this is printed: the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr which is s, and the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr which is e plus 1**
