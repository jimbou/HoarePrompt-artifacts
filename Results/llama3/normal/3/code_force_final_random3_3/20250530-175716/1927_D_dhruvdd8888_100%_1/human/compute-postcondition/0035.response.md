Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the values -1 and -1.

The variables s, e, num, N, LA, and the list arr are not used in the print statement. The values of these variables are described in the precondition, but they do not affect the output of the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1, -1**
