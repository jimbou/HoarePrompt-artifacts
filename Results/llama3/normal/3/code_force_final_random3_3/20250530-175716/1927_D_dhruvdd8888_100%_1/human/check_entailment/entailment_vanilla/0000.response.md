Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` in an array `a` such that `a_i != a_j`. The program uses a two-pointer technique to track the start and end of a subarray with the same elements. It then uses binary search to find the appropriate subarray for each query.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It then iterates through the array `a` and creates a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains the start index `s`, end index `e`, and the value `num` of a subarray with the same elements.
3. For each query, the program uses binary search to find the appropriate subarray in `arr` that contains the range `[l, r]`.
4. If the start index `s` of the subarray is greater than `l`, it means that the subarray starts after `l`. In this case, the program checks if `s` is equal to 1 or if `s` is greater than `r`. If either condition is true, it means that there is no pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`, so the program prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints `s - 1` and `s`, which are the indices of the pair of different elements.
5. If the end index `e` of the subarray is greater than or equal to `r`, it means that the subarray ends after `r`. In this case, the program prints `-1 -1`, indicating that there is no pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`.
6. If the end index `e` of the subarray is less than `N` (the length of the array) or less than `l`, it means that the subarray ends before `l`. In this case, the program prints `s` and `e + 1`, which are the indices of the pair of different elements.
7. If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints `-1 -1`, indicating that there is no pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly solves the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
