stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then multiple pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list of integers. The second integer is the number of pairs of integers. Each pair of integers represents a query. The list of integers and the pairs of integers are separated by a newline character.
