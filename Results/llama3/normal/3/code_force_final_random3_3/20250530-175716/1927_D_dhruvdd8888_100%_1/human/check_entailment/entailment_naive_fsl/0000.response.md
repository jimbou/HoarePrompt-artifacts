Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. It first creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end indices of a subarray with the same elements, as well as the element itself. It then uses binary search to find the appropriate tuple for each query.

The program handles all edge cases correctly. For example, if the query range is within a single subarray with the same elements, it correctly returns -1 -1. If the query range spans multiple subarrays with the same elements, it correctly returns the start index of the first subarray and the end index of the second subarray. If the query range is outside the range of the input array, it correctly returns -1 -1.

The program also handles the case where the input array has a single element, or where the query range is a single element. In these cases, it correctly returns -1 -1.

The use of binary search to find the appropriate tuple for each query is also correct, as it allows the program to efficiently find the correct tuple in O(log n) time.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
