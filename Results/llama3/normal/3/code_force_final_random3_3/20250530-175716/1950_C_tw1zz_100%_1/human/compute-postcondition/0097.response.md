Based on the initial state, the print statement will output the adjusted hour `h1`, the minute `m`, and the time of day `time` in the format `hh:mm AM/PM`.

Here's the breakdown:

* `h1`: This is the adjusted hour based on the original hour `h`. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01'. If `h` is '02' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h`. If `h` is '12', `h1` remains '12'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is adjusted accordingly (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.). If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12'.
* `m`: This is the minute of the first time input, which is simply printed as is.
* `time`: This is the time of day, which is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the original hour `h`. If `h` is '01' to '11', `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12' to '23', `time` is 'PM'.

Since the exact value of `h` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `h1` and `time`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the adjusted hour, minute, and time of day in the format `hh:mm AM/PM`.

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where h1 is the adjusted hour, m is the minute, and time is the time of day, either AM or PM)**
