If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '02' to '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 remains '12'. If h is '13' to '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is adjusted accordingly. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. The time is printed in the format h1:m:time where h1 is the adjusted hour, m is the minute, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM'**
