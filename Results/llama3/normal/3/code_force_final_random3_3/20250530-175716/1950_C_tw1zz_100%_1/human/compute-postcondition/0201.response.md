The code prints the time in 12-hour format. The hour is represented by the variable `h1`, which is derived from the hour `h` of the first time input in 24-hour format. The minute is represented by the variable `m`, which is the minute of the first time input. The time of day (AM or PM) is represented by the variable `time`, which is determined based on the value of `h`.

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format derived from h, m is the minute of the first time input, and time is AM or PM based on the value of h)**
