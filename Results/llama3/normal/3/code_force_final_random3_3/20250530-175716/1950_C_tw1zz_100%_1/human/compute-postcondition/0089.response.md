Postcondition: **The program processes the input time in 24-hour format and converts it to 12-hour format. If the hour is '08', the time is set to 'AM' and the hour remains '08'. For hours '09' to '11', the time is set to 'AM' and the hour remains the same. For hour '12', the time is set to 'PM' and the hour remains '12'. For hours '13' to '23', the time is set to 'PM' and the hour is adjusted accordingly (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.). For hour '00', the time is set to 'AM' and the hour is set to '12'. For hours '01' to '07', the values of time and hour remain unchanged.**
