Postcondition: ***h is the hour of the first time input, m1 is the minute of the first time input, m is the minute of the first time input, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, t is greater than 0. If h is '02', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '02'. If h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 remains '12'. If h is '13' to '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is adjusted accordingly. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'.***
