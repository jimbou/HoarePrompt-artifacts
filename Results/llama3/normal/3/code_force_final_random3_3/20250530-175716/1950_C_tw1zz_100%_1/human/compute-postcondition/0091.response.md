Postcondition: ***h is the hour of the first time input, m1 is the minute of the first time input, m is the minute of the first time input, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, t is greater than 0. If h is '06', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '06'. If h is '07' to '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 remains the same. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 remains '12'. If h is '13' to '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is adjusted accordingly. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. If h is '01' to '05', then the values of time and h1 remain unchanged.***
