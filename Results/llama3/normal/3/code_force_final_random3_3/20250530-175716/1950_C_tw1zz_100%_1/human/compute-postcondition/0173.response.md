The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '09' to the variable h1. The second line assigns the string 'PM' to the variable time. 

The initial state of h1 was an empty string, and the initial state of time was also an empty string. After the code executes, h1 becomes '09', and time becomes 'PM'. The values of h, m, m1, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.

Output State: **h is a string representing the hour of the first time input in 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute of the first time input, m1 is the minute of the second time input, h1 is '09', time is 'PM', stdin contains t-3 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**
