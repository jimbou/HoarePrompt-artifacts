Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert a 24-hour time format to a 12-hour time format. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads a string representing the time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and splits it into hours (h) and minutes (m).

3. The program then uses a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format (h1) and whether it's AM or PM (time).

4. The conditions in the if-elif-else statements correctly handle the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format. For example, '00' in 24-hour format is converted to '12' in 12-hour format with 'AM', and '12' in 24-hour format remains '12' in 12-hour format but with 'PM'.

5. After determining h1 and time, the program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".

6. The program correctly handles all possible hours in 24-hour format (00 to 23) and converts them to their equivalent in 12-hour format.

7. The program also correctly handles the minutes, as it simply prints the original minutes (m) without any conversion.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly converts the given time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

Correctness: **True**
