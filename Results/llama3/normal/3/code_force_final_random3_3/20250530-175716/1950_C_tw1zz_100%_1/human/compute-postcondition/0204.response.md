Functionality: **Converts and prints 24-hour time inputs to 12-hour format.**

The function takes no parameters but reads input from stdin. It expects an integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings representing times in 24-hour format (hh:mm). 

The function then converts each time to 12-hour format and prints it. The conversion involves adjusting the hour and adding 'AM' or 'PM' based on the original hour value. 

After processing all inputs, the function leaves stdin empty and does not return any value.
