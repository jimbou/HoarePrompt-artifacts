The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '08' to the variable h1. The second line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable time. 

Since the initial state of time was an empty string, it is now updated to 'AM'. The variable h1 was not present in the initial state, so it is added to the output state with the value '08'. The other variables (h, m1, m) and stdin remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **h is the hour of the first time input, m1 is the minute of the second time input, m is the minute of the second time input, time is 'AM', h1 is '08', stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format**
