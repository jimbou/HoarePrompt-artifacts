State: **`h` is the hour of the first time input, `m1` is the minute of the second time input, `m` is the minute of the second time input, stdin contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', then time is 'AM'. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '12'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12', and this is printed: h1 (where h1 is the hour of the first time input in 12-hour format), m (where m is the minute of the second time input), and time (where time is either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour of the first time input)**
