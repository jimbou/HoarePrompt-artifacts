Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly converts the input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The program handles all possible cases for the hour in the 24-hour format and correctly determines the equivalent hour in the 12-hour format, as well as the AM/PM designation. The program also correctly handles the case where the input hour is '00', which should be converted to '12' in the 12-hour format with an AM designation.

Correctness: **True**
