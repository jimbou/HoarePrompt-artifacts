Postcondition: **h is the hour of the first time input, m1 is the minute of the first time input, m is the minute of the first time input, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, t is greater than 0. If h is 09, time is AM, h1 is 09. If h is 10 or 11, time is AM and h1 is the same as h. If h is 12, time is PM and h1 is 12. If h is between 13 and 23, time is PM and h1 is adjusted accordingly (13 becomes 01, 14 becomes 02, 15 becomes 03, 16 becomes 04, 17 becomes 05, 18 becomes 06, 19 becomes 07, 20 becomes 08, 21 becomes 09, 22 becomes 10, 23 becomes 11). If h is 00, time is AM and h1 is 12. For all other hours (01 to 08), the values of time and h1 remain unchanged.**
