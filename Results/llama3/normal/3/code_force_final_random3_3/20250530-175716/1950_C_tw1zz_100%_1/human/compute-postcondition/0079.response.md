Postcondition: **The hour of the first time input is converted to a 12-hour format. If the hour is 18, the time is set to PM and the hour is set to 06. If the hour is between 19 and 23, the time is set to PM and the hour is adjusted accordingly (19 becomes 07, 20 becomes 08, 21 becomes 09, 22 becomes 10, 23 becomes 11). If the hour is 00, the time is set to AM and the hour is set to 12. For all other hours, the time and hour remain unchanged. The minute of the first time input and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.**
