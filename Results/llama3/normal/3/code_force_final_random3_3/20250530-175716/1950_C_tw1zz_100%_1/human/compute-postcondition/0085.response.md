Postcondition: **The hour of the first time input is converted to a 12-hour format. If the hour is 12, the time is set to 'PM' and the hour remains '12'. If the hour is between 13 and 23, the time is set to 'PM' and the hour is adjusted accordingly (13 becomes 01, 14 becomes 02, 15 becomes 03, 16 becomes 04, 17 becomes 05, 18 becomes 06, 19 becomes 07, 20 becomes 08, 21 becomes 09, 22 becomes 10, 23 becomes 11). If the hour is 00, the time is set to 'AM' and the hour is set to '12'. For all other hours (01 to 11), the time is set to 'AM' and the hour remains unchanged.**
