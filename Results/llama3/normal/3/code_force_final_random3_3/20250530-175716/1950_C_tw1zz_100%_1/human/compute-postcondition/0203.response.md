Output State: **h is a string representing the hour of the tth time input in 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute of the tth time input, m1 is the minute of the tth time input, stdin is empty, t is 0. If h is '01', then h1 is '01' and time is 'AM'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', then h1 is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively and time is 'AM'. If h is '12', then h1 is '12' and time is 'PM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively and time is 'PM'. If h is '00', then h1 is '12' and time is 'AM', and the time in 12-hour format is printed as h1 : m time.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input times and printed them in 12-hour format. The hour and minute of the last input time are stored in the variables h and m, respectively. The variable m1 also stores the minute of the last input time. The input buffer stdin is empty, and the variable t is 0, indicating that all input times have been processed. The variables h1 and time store the adjusted hour and AM/PM indicator for the last input time, respectively.
