Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that are printed.

The variable `h1` is determined based on the value of `h`. If `h` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then `h1` is the same as `h`. If `h` is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then `h1` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12'.

The variable `m` is the minute of the second time input, which is an integer between 0 and 59.

The variable `time` is determined based on the value of `h`. If `h` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then `time` is 'PM'.

Therefore, the print statement will print the value of `h1` (which is the hour of the first time input in 12-hour format), followed by a colon, followed by the value of `m` (which is the minute of the second time input), followed by a space, and finally followed by the value of `time` (which is either 'AM' or 'PM').

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where h1 is the hour of the first time input in 12-hour format, m is the minute of the second time input, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM')**
