Output: **n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), i is 0, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). The current value of b is not divisible by 3, the current value of c is less than 3, and the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, and -1 is being printed**
