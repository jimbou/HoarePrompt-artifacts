Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^4), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `k` is an integer equal to the previous value of `k` plus `a + (b + c) // 3`. If (b + c) % 3 != 0, then the value of `k` is increased by 1 and the value of `k` is being printed. If (b + c) % 3 == 0, then the value of `k` is being printed. If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, then -1 is being printed.***
