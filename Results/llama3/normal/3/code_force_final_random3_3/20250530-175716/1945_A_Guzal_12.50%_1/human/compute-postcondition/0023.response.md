Postcondition: ***n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^4), i is 1, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is 0, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, then -1 is being printed. Otherwise, if (b + c) % 3 != 0, then k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 and the value of k is being printed. If (b + c) % 3 == 0, then k is a + (b + c) // 3 and the value of k is being printed.***
