Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^4), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the sum of `a` and the integer division of `b + c` by 3. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains `n-3` lines, each containing three integers, as one line has been read to update the value of `k`.
