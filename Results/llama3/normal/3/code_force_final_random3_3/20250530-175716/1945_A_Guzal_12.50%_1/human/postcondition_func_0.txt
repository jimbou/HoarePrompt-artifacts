This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads three integers a, b, and c. It calculates a value k based on the values of a, b, and c, and prints the result. If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates k as a + (b + c) // 3, and if (b + c) % 3 != 0, it increments k by 1. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
