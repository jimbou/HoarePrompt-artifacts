The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^4). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^4), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `k` is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**
