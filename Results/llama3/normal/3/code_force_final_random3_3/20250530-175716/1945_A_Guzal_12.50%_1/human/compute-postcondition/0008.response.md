Postcondition: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `k` is equal to `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). Either `b` is divisible by 3, or `c` is 3 or more, or the sum of `b` and `c` is divisible by 3. The current value of the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3.**
