Output State: **`n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^4), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `k` is an integer equal to the previous value of `k` plus `a + (b + c) // 3`, stdin contains n-4 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, then -1 is being printed. Otherwise, if (b + c) % 3 != 0, then the value of `k` is being printed. If (b + c) % 3 == 0, then the value of `k` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been updated by adding `a + (b + c) // 3` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less line of input. The conditions for printing -1 or the value of `k` are still the same as before.
