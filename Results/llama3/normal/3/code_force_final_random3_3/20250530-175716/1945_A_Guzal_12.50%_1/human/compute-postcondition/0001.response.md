To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to 0 (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`). 

State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `i` is 0**
