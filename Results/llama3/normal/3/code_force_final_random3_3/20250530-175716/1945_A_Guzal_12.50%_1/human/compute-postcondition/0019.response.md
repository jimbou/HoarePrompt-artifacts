Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^4), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been incremented by 1, and it is now equal to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
