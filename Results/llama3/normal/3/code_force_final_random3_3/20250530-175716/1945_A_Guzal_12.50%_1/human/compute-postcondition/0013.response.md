Postcondition: **n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), i is 0, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). If the current value of b is not divisible by 3, the current value of c is less than 3, and the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, then -1 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of k which is equal to a plus one-third of the sum of b and c, and possibly increased by 1 if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3 is being printed.**
