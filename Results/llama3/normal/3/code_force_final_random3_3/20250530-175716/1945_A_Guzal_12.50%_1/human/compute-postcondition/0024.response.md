The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^4). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer (3 <= n <= 10^4), i is 2, a, b, c are integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), k is 0, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing three integers (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). If (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0, then -1 is being printed. Otherwise, if (b + c) % 3 != 0, then k is a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 and the value of k is being printed. If (b + c) % 3 == 0, then k is a + (b + c) // 3 and the value of k is being printed.**
